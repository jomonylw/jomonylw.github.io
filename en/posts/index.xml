Choosing the wrong target can lead to slow wealth growth, akin to becoming poorer. Second, it emphasizes the critical importance of financial communication with spouses, parents, and family members on the path to wealth through investment. Consensus should be built through continuous and frank discussions to avoid family relationship breakdowns over money issues.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<lite-youtube videoid="97CcSE_y780" playlabel="97CcSE_y780" params=""></lite-youtube>

<p>This session&rsquo;s core viewpoints from Teacher James revolve around two main areas:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Decisive Nature of Investment Choices</strong>: Not all index funds can make you rich. Through detailed data comparisons, the teacher reveals the huge long-term return gap between QQQ and other index funds like SPY and VT, emphasizing the decisive role of choosing the right investment target (like QQQ) for wealth accumulation.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Financial Communication</strong>: On the road to wealth through investment, maintaining family relationships (especially with spouses and parents) is crucial. The teacher advocates for building financial consensus and trust among family members through continuous, &ldquo;chatter-style&rdquo; communication, sharing responsibilities, and avoiding family conflicts sparked by wealth growth.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communication with a Spouse</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Constant Chatter&rdquo; Method</strong>: It&rsquo;s recommended to share investment ideas, operations, and progress with your spouse in the form of daily conversation. This isn&rsquo;t for them to fully understand, but to give them a sense of participation and the right to be informed, building synchronization and trust. For example, casually mention what you bought more of today, what class you attended, or any new ideas you have.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Responsibility</strong>: Communicating from the start to reach a consensus gives both partners a sense of ownership in the decisions. Whether there are profits or losses, you can face them together, avoiding one person bearing all the pressure and getting unappreciated for their efforts. The teacher uses his company management as an example: his subordinates know all the information he does, so responsibilities are shared, and the manager feels no pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Secrets, Honesty is Respect</strong>: There should be no financial secrets from your spouse. Say what&rsquo;s on your mind; this is a form of respect. Making decisions alone, regardless of success or failure, can pose a risk to the family relationship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Communication with Parents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Planning and Gentle Communication</strong>: When parents are approaching retirement age (50s-60s), you should begin discussing future financial and care arrangements. Use a caring tone and examples (like the sudden situations of neighbor Mrs. Chang or Uncle Li) to gradually &ldquo;brainwash&rdquo; them, rather than forcefully demanding management rights.</li>
<li><strong>The Role of Children</strong>: Children who have learned about finance should bravely take on the role of the family CFO (Chief Financial Officer), responsible for financial planning, investment management, and payment systems, while keeping clear accounts and reporting to the family regularly.</li>
<li><strong>Elder Care Trusts</strong>: If parents are not comfortable entrusting their money to a single child, or if the children cannot reach a consensus, consider setting up an &ldquo;Elder Care Trust.&rdquo; The bank would be responsible for management and payments, and some banks even allow specifying investment targets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Practice of Caring for Parents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevention is Better Than Cure</strong>: Care for your parents should start with daily life, paying attention to their &ldquo;eating, drinking, defecating, urinating, and sleeping.&rdquo; Take them for regular health check-ups (for the &ldquo;three highs&rdquo; - high blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar), monitor their vision (e.g., get injections for macular degeneration early, even if you have to pay out-of-pocket), hearing (e.g., get hearing aids from Costco early), knees, and other body &ldquo;parts,&rdquo; intervening at the first sign of a problem.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Sleep</strong>: Understand your parents&rsquo; sleep situation. If they don&rsquo;t sleep well, you can discuss solutions, such as trying Melatonin, and avoid sleeping pills with significant side effects.</li>
<li><strong>Health is the Children&rsquo;s Happiness</strong>: When parents are healthy and can take care of themselves, it is the greatest happiness for their children. Don&rsquo;t wait until they are bedridden to start managing; the family burden will be extremely heavy by then.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Astonishing Long-Term Performance Differences</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>40 years</strong>: QQQ had an annualized return of 14%, while SPY (S&amp;P 500) was only 8.95%—a huge gap.</li>
<li><strong>17 years</strong>: QQQ&rsquo;s annualized return was 15.8%, SPY/VOO/VTI was about 9.6%, while VT (Total World Stock) was a meager 5.7%.</li>
<li><strong>10 years</strong>: QQQ&rsquo;s annualized return was 18.17%, SPY was 11.8%, and VT was only 7.8%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Those who invest in QQQ might become &ldquo;billionaires,&rdquo; those in SPY are &ldquo;wealthy people,&rdquo; and those in VT might become &ldquo;poor people who think they are rich.&rdquo; If the direction is wrong, all effort is wasted.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Correction</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: What if I have already bought SPY, VOO, or VT, especially in the US where I have to pay taxes?</li>
<li><strong>Answer</strong>: You must sell! Pay for past mistakes, pay the tax once, but in return, you get much higher long-term returns in the future. Don&rsquo;t cling to the wrong assets for a lifetime just to save a little on taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Sunk Cost</strong>: It&rsquo;s like finding out the elevator is broken and switching to another one immediately, not stubbornly waiting in the broken one. It&rsquo;s also like realizing a relationship isn&rsquo;t working after five years; you can&rsquo;t continue down the wrong path just because you&rsquo;ve invested five years.</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>From Money Anxiety to Magnanimity</strong>: Taking the sharing from student Michael as an example, he used to have anxiety about money because he was afraid of spending it. After getting rich through investing, his life got better and better, but more importantly, his mindset changed. He learned to use money with magnanimity for physical and mental health and family happiness. Letting go of money anxiety can improve relationships with family.</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;C&rdquo; Investment Philosophy</strong>: Aims to eliminate poverty and people&rsquo;s anxiety about money. We should not be slaves to capital, but capitalists. &ldquo;Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right.&rdquo; We should live a worthy life.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation Principles</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash is King</strong>: Keep at least 30% in cash. Cash is the &ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark&rdquo; of investing; it can save your life.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Leverage</strong>: For those who want to use leverage but are afraid of the risk, you can start with a lower Beta (e.g., 0.5-0.7) and gradually get used to it.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy for Young People</strong>: Even with little capital, you must first establish an emergency fund. For example, if you only have 200,000 TWD but your annual living expenses are 300,000 TWD, you cannot invest this 200,000. You should save up the emergency fund first, and then invest the rest.</li>

<li>Question: I am 27 this year. How should I prepare for my parents&rsquo; (around 60) future medical expenses? About how much money is needed?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Based on my mother&rsquo;s experience (she had 6 million TWD prepared when she started needing care at age 80), and considering inflation, one parent might need about 10 million TWD in 20 years. I suggest you start now, saving at least 10,000 TWD per month for your parents, and separately save for your own retirement. More importantly, start paying attention to your parents&rsquo; health now. Take them to the metabolism department for regular check-ups (like blood sugar, cholesterol) and address hearing and vision problems promptly. Prevention is better than cure.</li>

<li>Question: The retirement account at my current company (TIAA) does not offer QQQ, but my previous company&rsquo;s retirement account (Fidelity) does. What should I do?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: First, for the account from the job you&rsquo;ve already left, you can do a Rollover into an IRA account, which will allow you to freely invest in QQQ. For your current company&rsquo;s underperforming retirement account, I suggest you stop contributing to it. You should prioritize maxing out your Roth IRA, and put the rest of your money directly into your own Brokerage Account to buy QQQ.</li>

Thank you very much for the guidance, I believe the future will be better and better.

<li>Question: After my sister took the teacher&rsquo;s class, she canceled more than a dozen insurance policies, took out a personal loan, and invested heavily in 00662 (the Taiwanese QQQ equivalent). Our family thinks she&rsquo;s &ldquo;gone off the deep end.&rdquo; Many people around us still advocate for individual stocks. May I ask why the teacher himself switched from investing in individual stocks to exclusively recommending index funds?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I invested in individual stocks for over 30 years. Although my performance was good, after taxes, I didn&rsquo;t truly beat QQQ. More critically, individual stock trading requires real-time buy/sell instructions. For a community of tens of thousands of students like we have now, I cannot provide timely notifications, which would cause losses for everyone. Therefore, abandoning complex individual stock picking, which may not even yield better results in the end, and turning to simple, transparent index investing with excellent long-term returns is the most responsible and effective method for everyone.</li>

<li>Question: The teacher mentioned that wealth will become more concentrated in the future, &ldquo;the big get bigger.&rdquo; In that case, would an ETF like 00757 (FNGS), which is even more concentrated in tech giants, be better than 00662 (QQQ)?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I don&rsquo;t recommend it. The biggest problem with 00757 is its &ldquo;unpredictability.&rdquo; Its stock selection logic is not transparent (why these 10 stocks?), and its volatility is unknown, which makes it impossible for you to do scientific asset allocation. Its performance is not necessarily better than the predictable QLD (00670L, the 2x leveraged QQQ). The so-called &ldquo;mean reversion&rdquo; does not exist between assets of different natures (e.g., apples and oranges don&rsquo;t revert to each other). Instead of investing in a fund you don&rsquo;t understand, it&rsquo;s better to build your own &ldquo;top ten&rdquo; portfolio based on QQQ&rsquo;s holdings, which has a clearer logic.</li>

This is eternal, and we should learn and think about how to &ldquo;take and use&rdquo; it in our real lives. The other part is humanity&rsquo;s animal nature (like cruelty, selfishness). I&rsquo;ve observed that this aspect has not changed from ancient times to the present, despite advances in material civilization. When we study history, the focus should be on drawing lessons and applying them, not just criticizing or admiring.</li>

<li>Question: I use a sub-brokerage account in Taiwan to buy QQQ and then never sell. Is this okay? And if I have a large home equity line of credit, is it good to keep it as an emergency fund?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: No, that&rsquo;s not okay. The problems are: 1. <strong>Taxes</strong>: When your assets grow to tens of millions, you will eventually need the money, and as soon as you sell, you will face high capital gains taxes. 2. <strong>Opportunity Cost</strong>: Keeping your HELOC credit line as cash is a huge waste. You should borrow all the money you can and invest it in the market. Even just buying short-term bonds (like 00865B in Taiwan) for arbitrage is better than letting the money sleep in the bank. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of the debt figure; look at the growth potential of your assets. The market is always at a low point. You must act immediately, right now.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Investment hesitation is the biggest mistake.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: At the beginning of the session, the teacher emphasized that the market doesn&rsquo;t wait when it&rsquo;s rising. The hesitant mentality of not buying whether the market is up or down is the biggest mistake in investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t avoid doing the right thing just to save on taxes.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When answering a student&rsquo;s question about whether to sell SPY/VOO to switch to QQQ, the teacher stressed that even if it means paying taxes, one should decisively correct wrong investment decisions to focus on the correct long-term returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must do a smart rebalance every year with leveraged funds, or you will be wiped out overnight.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When explaining how to hold leveraged ETFs like TQQQ and QLD, the teacher repeatedly emphasized that these products must be managed with an annual &ldquo;smart rebalance&rdquo; to lock in profits and control risk; otherwise, long-term holding could lead to returns diminishing to zero.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;ve read so many books, now put them to use!
&ndash; Teacher James (quoting a general manager)</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When discussing how to learn from history and philosophy, the teacher emphasized that the ultimate purpose of knowledge is practice. If you read the classics, you must think about how to apply them in your life; otherwise, no amount of knowledge is more than just garbage in your head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The market is always at a low point.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When encouraging students to overcome their fear of heights and invest immediately, the teacher pointed out that relative to the future price (e.g., QQQ potentially reaching 50,000 points), any current price should be considered a low point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Explaining the philosophy of C-position investment and financial education, the core of which is to help people break free from money anxiety and live a happy, fulfilling life where they realize their self-worth, rather than being slaves to money.</p>

<p>This session once again reinforced the core strategies and philosophy of C-position investment and financial management. In terms of investment strategy, it irrefutably demonstrated the superiority of QQQ as a core asset through detailed data comparisons, urging students to have the courage to correct past investment mistakes, even if it incurs some tax costs. On the philosophy of life and family relations, the teacher profoundly pointed out that wealth growth must go hand-in-hand with family harmony. The key to achieving this is continuous, honest financial communication built on a foundation of trust. Whether it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;constant chatter&rdquo; sharing between spouses or the patient guidance for parents, the goal is to build a family financial system based on consensus and shared responsibility. Ultimately, the course guides us back to the origin of investing: to use capital as a tool to achieve a happy and meaningful life, free from anxiety about money.</p>

<p>The core theme of this session is <strong>how to unlock the value of real estate through financial instruments, converting fixed assets into liquid capital for investment, thereby achieving exponential wealth growth</strong>. The instructor details two methods, &ldquo;reverse mortgages&rdquo; and &ldquo;investment-type home equity loans,&rdquo; and emphasizes that in Taiwan&rsquo;s low-interest-rate environment, borrowing to invest is a powerful lever for ordinary people to accumulate wealth. At the same time, the course reiterates that future wealth gaps will be primarily determined by the choice of investment vehicles, with those investing in high-tech indexes (like the Nasdaq-100) pulling far ahead of those investing in traditional broad market indexes.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: A friend working in bank lending suggested that the instructor share the concept of &ldquo;reverse mortgages,&rdquo; which is an excellent option for many retirees who have insufficient funds but own a mortgage-free home.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of &ldquo;Investment-Type Home Equity Loans&rdquo;</strong>: For retirees without a stable source of income, applying for an &ldquo;investment-type home equity loan&rdquo; is highly risky.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Suppose you borrow TWD 10 million at a 2.4% annual interest rate, requiring TWD 240,000 in annual interest payments. However, according to our investment principles, you can only safely withdraw 2% of this TWD 10 million asset annually (which is TWD 200,000). Since the interest expense exceeds the usable amount, it results in negative cash flow, which is very risky.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of &ldquo;Reverse Mortgages&rdquo;</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: Individuals who are retired, have no income, are unable to qualify for an investment-type home equity loan, but own a mortgage-free property and have insufficient investment capital to support their retirement.</li>
<li><strong>Core Benefit</strong>: Through a reverse mortgage, you can receive a stable monthly cash flow for living expenses, while your original investment principal of several million or ten million TWD can remain untouched to continue compounding in the market. This is equivalent to &ldquo;borrowing money to live, while letting your own assets continue to grow.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Information from Taiwanese Banks</strong>: The instructor provided information from institutions like Bank of Taiwan for &ldquo;reverse mortgages,&rdquo; with interest rates around 2.2% to 2.6% and loan terms typically up to 30 years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conditions for Investment-Type Home Equity Loans</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Rate</strong>: The current rate for a general investment-type home equity loan is about 2.59%.</li>
<li><strong>Restrictions</strong>: There are requirements on the age of the property and the loan term (e.g., building age + loan term &lt; 60). This could limit young people who buy older, second-hand homes from accessing this service in the future.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: There have been many recent cases in the country where seniors&rsquo; properties were scammed. Fraud groups often target properties that do not have a mortgage lien.</li>
<li><strong>Preventive Measures</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Do Not Cancel the Mortgage Lien</strong>: Even if the mortgage is fully paid off, it is recommended not to go to the land administration office to cancel the bank&rsquo;s mortgage lien. Keeping this registered lien adds a layer of security.</li>
<li><strong>Apply for Two Services</strong>: Children can take their parents to the household registration office to apply for &ldquo;<strong>Advance Notice Registration</strong>&rdquo; (to prevent the property from being arbitrarily transferred or sold) and the &ldquo;<strong>Real-time Land Registry Alert</strong>&rdquo; service (which sends an immediate notification if there are any changes to the property&rsquo;s land registry data).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Case Sharing</strong>: A friend renting a townhouse in the US encountered many problems, such as poor sanitation, high hidden fees (trash disposal fee $80, sewage fee $80), inability to choose utility providers, and non-transparent bills (a fixed charge of over $300 per month), causing the actual monthly expenses to be far higher than the rent.</li>
<li><strong>Instructor&rsquo;s View</strong>: High living costs are a common phenomenon in the United States. Taking himself as an example, his monthly HOA fees plus utilities, internet, etc., amount to over $1,100 before even buying food. He reminds everyone to carefully inspect the property condition and contract terms and to clarify all fees before signing a lease.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Future Wealth Will Be More Concentrated</strong>: Artificial intelligence and digital finance will accelerate the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few companies and individuals. In the future, it could be that 0.1% of the population controls 80% of the wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Choosing the Right Vehicle is Crucial</strong>: Between investing and not investing, your assets will differ by two zeros. For those who invest in indexes, the assets of those who choose the wrong indexes (like VT, VOO, SPY) versus the right one (QQQ) will also differ by two zeros in the future. People investing in high-dividend stocks or SPY may become relatively poor in the future.</li>
<li><strong>The Purpose of Asset Allocation</strong>: The quality of an asset allocation and rebalancing strategy is not determined by the strategy itself, but by <strong>future market conditions</strong>. Since we cannot predict the future, the primary purpose of asset allocation is to <strong>give you peace of mind, enabling you to endure the worst market periods (like a continuous ten-year decline)</strong>, rather than pursuing the highest short-term performance.</li>
<li><strong>On Educating Children</strong>: When facing a child&rsquo;s problem, analyze whether it&rsquo;s a lack of &ldquo;ability&rdquo; or a lack of &ldquo;willingness.&rdquo; A lack of ability requires &ldquo;teaching,&rdquo; while a lack of willingness requires &ldquo;encouragement.&rdquo; Plant good seeds and nurture them with love, companionship, and positive energy.</li>
<li><strong>Become a Capitalist, Free from Money Worries</strong>: By understanding investment and becoming a capitalist, you can free yourself and the next generation from the fear and anxiety of money, achieve generational wealth, and possess the right to be happy.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Seniors in Taiwan are in a pitiful situation now because landlords, fearing that an elderly person might pass away in the property and turn it into a &ldquo;stigmatized property&rdquo; affecting its value, are unwilling to rent to them.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This is actually an excuse by landlords; legally, a natural death does not constitute a stigmatized property. The fundamental problem is poverty. If you become wealthy, you won&rsquo;t have housing problems. The lack of investment and financial literacy education in Taiwan makes it difficult for many people to accumulate wealth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: I bought 00662 at a high point of 93 earlier this year. Even though the US QQQ has reached a new high, my 00662 has not yet broken even because the Taiwan dollar has appreciated. I feel anxious. Should I use a sub-brokerage account to buy the US stock QQQ directly?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: This is a normal phenomenon caused by exchange rates. If you convert the price of QQQ at its peak back then using the higher exchange rate at the time (e.g., 33), you would find that its value in TWD also hasn&rsquo;t reached a new high. It&rsquo;s essentially the same, so there&rsquo;s no need to worry about exchange rates. If you&rsquo;re in Taiwan, just buy 00662 with TWD. Buy whenever you have money, and don&rsquo;t worry about exchange rates or short-term market fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: I have a USD-denominated insurance policy with a 3.5% annualized return that I want to cancel, but I&rsquo;m worried about the unfavorable exchange rate for converting it back to TWD now. This money is for my child. Should I allocate it as 50% 00662 and 50% 00670L (a leveraged ETF)?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: A 3.5% return is too low; you should cancel it decisively. Don&rsquo;t worry about the short-term exchange rate, because after you convert to TWD and buy 00662, the nature of the asset reverts to a USD asset. For a 30-year investment for your child, the simplest and safest way is to buy 100% 00662 and hold it for the long term. If you must include leverage, you can, but you must understand its risks and rebalance properly. Otherwise, simply holding 00662 is better.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He has been following the instructor for nearly two years, and his assets have doubled. He uses a 4-3-3 allocation, holding 30% in cash (about 10 years of living expenses), which makes him completely indifferent to market ups and downs and gives him great peace of mind. He also shared a real-life case of his 72-year-old elder who applied for a &ldquo;reverse mortgage&rdquo;: for a TWD 7 million house, they can receive TWD 17,000 per month for 23 years. He believes this allows the elder to age with dignity and also frees up the children&rsquo;s funds. The filial piety money saved by the children can be invested to create even greater wealth.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This is an excellent sharing. This is the essence of a &ldquo;reverse mortgage.&rdquo; If the children invest the saved TWD 17,000 per month, at a 12% annualized rate of return, it will grow to over TWD 52 million in 30 years. This is equivalent to using a TWD 7 million loan from the bank to create tens of millions in additional wealth—a very smart financial move.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Fubon Bank has a 20-year revolving investment-type home equity loan product. She thinks it&rsquo;s better for young people than a reverse mortgage and suggests everyone look into it.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: There is no capital gains tax in Taiwan. In retirement, will it still be necessary to live off funds from a stock-pledged loan? Can I just sell the bond portion of my asset allocation for expenses?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: You don&rsquo;t have to use a pledged loan, but your wealth will grow much slower. He gives an example: with TWD 50 million in assets, if you sell 2% each year to live on (assuming a 10% rate of return), it will grow to TWD 2.2 billion in 40 years. If you live off a pledged loan and leave the principal untouched (assuming a 12% rate of return), it will grow to TWD 4.6 billion in 40 years—more than double the amount. The risk of pledging is controllable, but the return is enormous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: If I want to withdraw 3% annually, but my total assets are not yet large, should I switch to the less volatile SPY?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: No need. You can achieve this by adjusting the Beta of your asset allocation, for example, by using a 70-30 or 4-2-4 allocation while still holding QQQ, and you can still safely withdraw 3%.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: She discovered that an older colleague&rsquo;s retirement account balance was only one-third of hers. The reason was that the colleague chose a very conservative investment model, which fell less but also grew much less. This made her deeply realize the importance of choosing the right investment vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: She was most shocked to learn about the Pledge Asset Line (PAL) from the instructor and immediately opened one. She believes people should not be afraid of PAL. Compared to taking on a huge mortgage with a small down payment, PAL is a small loan based on a substantial asset foundation, making it much less risky. She compares PAL to a &ldquo;future employer&rdquo;—whenever you need money, you just go and get it. It&rsquo;s very convenient.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: An excellent sharing. This is the core of financial operations. In Taiwan, with such low interest rates, anyone with property must get an investment-type home equity loan or a reverse mortgage. Not borrowing this cheap money is a huge waste. You can only become truly wealthy if you know how to borrow money safely.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: She has a &ldquo;mental block&rdquo; about selling her 0050 (Taiwan 50 ETF). She feels that as a Taiwanese person, not holding 0050 means she lacks a &ldquo;sense of participation,&rdquo; and she feels very conflicted.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Emotional matters cannot be measured in money. But from a financial perspective, you should deal with it as soon as possible. He suggests she first go and set up the reverse mortgage. As for pledged loans, she can start by trying a small amount, like pledging TWD 1 million to borrow TWD 100,000 for a trip, just to experience it and gradually develop the habit of &ldquo;borrowing for consumption, letting the principal grow.&rdquo;</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: He just secured a TWD 7.5 million investment-type home equity loan and invested TWD 6 million in 00662. He wants to keep his monthly interest payment around TWD 10,000 and is struggling with a decision: should he use the entire TWD 6 million as his investment base for a 7-3 allocation, or use only TWD 4 million for the allocation and leave the remaining TWD 2 million untouched in the loan account to reduce interest?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: All loan interest should be paid from your salary. The invested TWD 6 million should be managed as a single portfolio. Given that he is still young, he should adopt a more aggressive allocation, such as 5-2-3 or 4-3-3. The cash portion of the allocation (e.g., 30%, which is TWD 1.8 million) should be invested in a high-yield money market fund (like 00865B, with an annualized return of about 4.5%), not left in the non-interest-bearing loan account.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: When rebalancing, if the market drops and I need to add to my leveraged ETF position, should the cash come from the cash position within my brokerage account or be transferred from an external bank account?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: The cash comes from the cash portion of your entire investment portfolio. Ideally, the leveraged fund is in a tax-advantaged account (like an IRA), and the cash for re-buying should also come from the cash position within that same account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: I can start accessing my 401K next year and plan to roll it into an IRA. At that time, living expenses and taxes might strain my cash flow. Should I use a PAL to cover these? What if a major market crash exhausts my PAL limit?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: This is why you keep 30% cash. If a market crash occurs and your brokerage account (where the PAL is) faces a margin call, you should transfer cash (e.g., by selling SWVXX) from your tax-advantaged account like an IRA to the brokerage account as collateral, not transfer stocks. SWVXX has a very high pledge rate (96%), which can effectively boost your collateral value and borrowing capacity. The asset allocation and Beta of your entire investment portfolio (brokerage + IRA) should be calculated and viewed as a whole.</li>

The specific method is: regularly remit a sum of money (e.g., USD 10,000) from the US to Bank A&rsquo;s account in Taiwan. Then, make a fixed monthly transfer from Bank A to Bank B&rsquo;s account (e.g., TWD 7,000 or 10,000).

<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: This depends on your cash flow situation. If the 2%-3% annual withdrawal from your investment assets is sufficient to cover your living expenses and the monthly mortgage payment, then there&rsquo;s no need to pay off the mortgage early; you can treat it as part of your living expenses. However, if the withdrawn money isn&rsquo;t even enough to live on, you should consider selling some assets to pay off the mortgage or converting the house into a &ldquo;reverse mortgage&rdquo; to improve your cash flow.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>In the future, it could be that 0.1% of the population will control 80% of the world&rsquo;s wealth&hellip; If you buy VT, VOO, SPY, these people will become poor in the future&hellip; Those of you who buy QQQ will have two more zeros in your assets than those people.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view points out the trend of extreme wealth polarization and emphasizes that choosing a high-growth tech index (QQQ) over traditional broad-market indexes is the key determinant of future wealth magnitude.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our performance is not determined by our asset allocation and rebalancing method; it&rsquo;s determined by what the future market will be, which we don&rsquo;t know. Therefore, the main purpose of our asset allocation is to find a state that gives you peace of mind, allowing you to get through the worst of markets.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view clarifies the fundamental purpose of asset allocation—it&rsquo;s for risk management and the investor&rsquo;s psychological comfort, enabling them to stay in the market for the long haul, rather than for predicting and chasing the highest short-term returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just think of the PAL (Pledge Asset Line) as your future employer. Whenever a month is up or anytime you want to get money, you just go to your PAL to get it.
&ndash; Student Puling</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a very vivid metaphor that explains the complex financial tool of &ldquo;pledged loans&rdquo; as a source of cash flow as convenient as receiving a salary, greatly lowering the barrier to understanding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not selling is your ancestor.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>With a humorous and colloquial phrase, the instructor emphasizes the extreme importance of long-term holding and avoiding the sale of assets, subverting the traditional wisdom that &ldquo;knowing when to sell makes you a master.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to get into the habit of borrowing money.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view challenges the traditional &ldquo;debt-free is worry-free&rdquo; concept, emphasizing that in a low-interest-rate environment, learning to use leverage safely and intelligently by borrowing to invest is a crucial habit for accelerating wealth accumulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was born in Taiwan, and if I don&rsquo;t own 0050, it feels like I&rsquo;m not participating. I&rsquo;m just very conflicted internally.
&ndash; Student Lana</p></blockquote>
<p>This sentence genuinely reflects the &ldquo;home bias&rdquo; and emotional factors that influence many investors&rsquo; decisions, serving as a very typical and relatable &ldquo;mental block.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This session reinforces the core investment philosophy of CLEC while introducing more specific wealth-growth strategies. Through the cases of &ldquo;reverse mortgages&rdquo; and &ldquo;investment-type home equity loans,&rdquo; the instructor vividly demonstrated how to unlock seemingly &ldquo;dormant&rdquo; real estate and turn it into fuel for wealth growth. The course not only provided operational guidance but, more importantly, continued to shape the investor&rsquo;s mindset: to break the fear of debt and understand the power of leverage; to abandon focus on short-term fluctuations and concentrate on choosing the right long-term track; and to recognize that the essence of wealth is cognition. Only by continuously improving financial literacy can one stand invincible in the future tide of wealth.</p>

This includes two levels: first, a financial awakening, which means transitioning from a &ldquo;slave&rdquo; working for money to a &ldquo;master&rdquo; who makes money work for them by holding index funds long-term and utilizing the rules of capitalism; second, a philosophical awakening in life, which involves prioritizing health (especially early screening for lung cancer) and breaking free from the constraints of societal expectations and the &ldquo;culture of hardship&rdquo; to pursue true freedom and happiness.</p>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James begins with the experience of a friend&rsquo;s family, strongly urging everyone to prioritize health, especially the early screening for lung cancer.</li>
<li><strong>Core Recommendation</strong>: Friends over 40 in Taiwan should pay for a low-dose computed tomography (Low-Dose CT, LDCT) scan out-of-pocket (around NT$5,000-6,000). Lung cancer is the &ldquo;king of cancers&rdquo; in Taiwan, often asymptomatic in its early stages, but the cure rate is high with early detection.</li>
<li><strong>Screening Frequency</strong>: If the scan is clear, you can do it again every 2-3 years. The latency period for lung adenocarcinoma is relatively long; it might take five years for a tumor to grow from 0.8 cm to 1.6 cm, providing enough time to respond with regular follow-ups.</li>
<li><strong>Added Value</strong>: An LDCT scan can also incidentally check for calcification or blockage in the heart&rsquo;s coronary arteries, serving two purposes at once.</li>
<li><strong>Advice for Overseas Chinese</strong>: For Chinese friends in the United States, since doctors there typically do not order such scans without symptoms, you might consider booking a self-paid health check-up at a teaching hospital in Taiwan a month and a half in advance when you travel back.</li>
<li><strong>Health is Fundamental</strong>: The teacher emphasizes that without health, all wealth is meaningless.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore Currency Fluctuations</strong>: Taking the 00662 fund as an example, although it is a USD-denominated product priced in TWD, its net value is affected by the TWD/USD exchange rate. However, over the long term (e.g., 30 years), the impact of exchange rates will smooth out. Investors should completely ignore currency fluctuations and focus on the growth of the asset itself.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Away from Wrong Products</strong>: Young people should not invest in high-dividend products, as they will only make you poorer. Also, be wary of insurance, annuities, and similar products, which the teacher calls &ldquo;products from a scam syndicate.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Adhere to Index Funds</strong>: It is only recommended to invest in broad-based index funds like the Nasdaq-100 (e.g., QQQ, 00662). Don&rsquo;t be misled by other ETFs on the market that are not true to their name.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Critique of &ldquo;Involution&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hardship&rdquo; Culture</strong>: The prevalent cultures of &ldquo;treating hardship as a tonic&rdquo; and &ldquo;involution&rdquo; in Asian societies lead to an increasingly difficult life for everyone. The teacher advocates for learning from Western thinking, realizing that we are not born to be laborers or slaves.</li>
<li><strong>The Intent Behind the Word &ldquo;Slave&rdquo;</strong>: The teacher deliberately uses the word &ldquo;slave&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;laborer&rdquo; to make the audience uncomfortable and thus spark an awakening. Under modern capitalism, apart from capitalists, most people are essentially &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; serving capital, to be discarded after use.</li>
<li><strong>Breaking Out of Mental Frameworks</strong>: Escaping inherent societal beliefs like &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t have food if you don&rsquo;t work hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;investing is wrong&rdquo; is harder than making the right investment itself. One must resist the negative influence of friends and family and stick to one&rsquo;s own path.</li>
<li><strong>True Freedom</strong>: Financial freedom is just the first step. True freedom is the ability to ignore the judgment of society and others, to grade yourself, and to live the life you want. You decide how you want to spend your money and what kind of life you want to live—that is freedom.</li>
<li><strong>Warning of Survivorship Bias</strong>: The teacher admits that his ability to make money in his first 20 years of speculation was due to &ldquo;heaven&rsquo;s mercy&rdquo; and &ldquo;luck,&rdquo; a case of survivorship bias that is not replicable. He strongly advises against imitating it.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalism and Inequality</strong>: The development of civilization has created information gaps, which are the root of inequality. Capitalism uses information asymmetry to create unfairness, which is essentially plunder. The teacher compares human conflicts to &ldquo;watching two groups of gorillas fighting,&rdquo; illustrating that human civilization has not progressed much in its essence; slavery exists today in a new form and on a larger scale.</li>
<li><strong>A Revolution to Eliminate Poverty</strong>: Teacher James sees his educational sharing as a &ldquo;revolution to eliminate poverty,&rdquo; aimed at awakening the masses to understand the rules of capitalism and transform from exploited &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; to &ldquo;masters&rdquo; who use the rules to their advantage.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation Principles</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Condition for Retirement: Assets reach 50 times annual expenses.</li>
<li>Retirement Allocation: Cash should be at least 30%, enough to cover more than 15 years of annual expenses.</li>
<li>Beta Value: The Beta of the initial allocation should not exceed 1.0.</li>
<li>Leveraged Funds: The position in leveraged funds should not exceed the cash position, nor should it exceed the position in the underlying fund.</li>
<li>Flexible Allocation: Besides the 4-3-3 model, configurations like 70/30, 60/40, and 50/50 are all viable. The key is to find what suits your own risk tolerance and cash flow needs.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>No Shortcuts in Investment Learning</strong>: Investment knowledge requires systematic learning and cannot be achieved overnight. You must connect the scattered &ldquo;dots&rdquo; of knowledge into &ldquo;lines,&rdquo; which then form a &ldquo;surface&rdquo; and a &ldquo;three-dimensional&rdquo; knowledge system through continuous watching of videos (e.g., starting from #398) and note-taking.</li>

Current technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, and digital finance are at a stage similar to the internet&rsquo;s underlying infrastructure (TCP/IP) in the 1980s; the real application explosion has not yet begun.</li>
<li><strong>The Revolutionary Nature of Agents</strong>: Taking OpenAI&rsquo;s Agent functionality as an example, future AI agents will be able to automatically complete complex tasks like booking tickets, shopping, and planning itineraries. This will disrupt many industries and create entirely new business models and corporate giants.</li>
<li><strong>Expectation of Returns</strong>: Based on this, the teacher believes that the 18% annualized return of the past 20 years may be an underestimation. In the future, 25% or even higher is possible, and it&rsquo;s not out of the question for the market to grow 100-fold in the next 20 years.</li>

<li><strong>Share</strong>: After attending the class in January 2024, I transferred my entire 401k to a brokerage account and invested it all at once. The market was down at the time, and my assets grew from $1.1 million to the current $1.7 million. My current asset allocation is 50% QQQ, 20% TQQQ.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: When I retire, should I convert the TQQQ to QQQ?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The focus isn&rsquo;t on TQQQ. The goal is to get your brokerage account funds to exceed $1 million so you can do stock pledges in the future. Your current tax rate is between 30-33%, so you should immediately start converting funds from your Traditional 401k/IRA to a Roth IRA in batches. Since your assets will be much higher in the future, a one-time conversion would face an extremely high tax bill. It&rsquo;s recommended to convert a portion each year, for example, $100,000 at a time (Note: a student pointed out that at a 30% tax rate, converting $100k would cost $30k in taxes, so be prepared). Strategically, you should place leveraged funds (like TQQQ) in the tax-free Roth account, while leaving cash in the Traditional account to slow its growth.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: After a promotion, I have to manage more people, and the pressure has skyrocketed, making me anxious, irritable, and even affecting my interactions with my family. How did you cope with high-pressure management positions back then?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The higher your position, the more relaxed you should be. If you&rsquo;re more tired, it means your management skills are lacking. The key is to learn to delegate and &ldquo;throw the monkeys,&rdquo; meaning you assign tasks to your subordinates to complete, and you only check and guide at critical points. Don&rsquo;t take the pressure from your superiors seriously; treat it as &ldquo;wind in your ears&rdquo; or a &ldquo;dog barking at a train.&rdquo; Your core job is to enhance your subordinates&rsquo; abilities and make them stronger than you, so you can truly &ldquo;work while lying down.&rdquo; When your boss scolds you, take a deep breath; that&rsquo;s his problem, don&rsquo;t let it affect your mood.</li>

<li><strong>Share</strong>: In the US, people with a history of smoking can get a low-dose CT scan (LDCT) covered by medical insurance. I get one every year.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: Can the CT scan you mentioned also detect problems with other organs like the pancreas?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: LDCT mainly targets the lungs. While it can also scan the liver, its effectiveness for pancreatic cancer screening is uncertain. For a full-body cancer cell screening, you need a PET Scan, but it has high radiation and is usually only for diagnosed cancer patients to check for metastasis. It&rsquo;s not recommended for healthy people.</li>

</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: If different asset allocations (like 80/20, 64/36) have the same Beta value (e.g., 0.8), will their expected performance be the same?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Not necessarily. Asset allocation itself doesn&rsquo;t determine performance; future market conditions do. In a rising market, a high-Beta allocation performs well; in a falling market, cash performs best. We do asset allocation to &ldquo;survive&rdquo; safely, not to predict or chase the highest performance.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: In the smart rebalancing strategy, do you ever rebalance the underlying fund (like QQQ)?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Yes, the underlying fund is never touched.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: If the market crashes and then rebounds, and the leveraged fund (like TQQQ) rises for the year but its total asset percentage has not returned to the initially set ratio (e.g., target 30%, now up from 20% to 28%), do I still need to sell one-third of the gains?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: You must sell. If you don&rsquo;t take out cash in a rising year and keep using cash to buy in a falling year, your cash reserves will be depleted quickly. Even if the leveraged fund hasn&rsquo;t returned to its previous high, as long as it has risen for the year, you must take out a portion of the profit (one-third of the gain) to replenish your cash. This is a critical risk control mechanism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: Besides living expenses, buying dips, and margin for pledges, does cash have other uses? I feel like a 30% cash allocation might be too high for me.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: 30% cash corresponds to 15 years of living expenses (calculated at a 2% annual withdrawal rate), which is a robust initial setting. If your pledged loans increase, your cash reserves need to increase accordingly to cover the debt risk. If you have other stable income (like social security, rent), you can continue to invest that income instead of reducing your cash reserve. Maintaining a 15-year cash reserve is a simple and effective strategy.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: I read Professor Chou&rsquo;s book, which mentioned not recommending long-term holding of leveraged ETFs because their value erodes over time and the long-term return is not double. This differs from your view. How should I understand this?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The annualized return of a leveraged fund is indeed not a linear double (e.g., if QQQ has a 10% annualized return, TQQQ might only be 14%), but due to the compounding effect, the total asset growth multiplier after 20 years will be far more than double. The reason Professor Chou doesn&rsquo;t recommend it is that he is addressing the general public and cannot teach complex asset allocation in depth. Holding leveraged funds is indeed very dangerous without asset allocation (i.e., without cash to buy on dips). Our method is built on strict asset allocation, which is the fundamental difference. These things can only be taught in a small, in-depth learning class; if you say this in the mass media, you&rsquo;ll be &ldquo;drowned in saliva.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: The market is hitting new highs, and I have the impulse to sell some of my QLD to lock in profits and increase cash. Should I do it now or wait until the end of the year?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Wait until the end of the year. The market&rsquo;s gain so far this year is not that large (about 10%). A normal bull year should see a rise of 30% or more. Only when there is a huge deviation (like a 50% annual gain) is there a need to consider adjusting early. Otherwise, just rebalance annually.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Share &amp; Question 2</strong>: I shared a strategy from a research paper, which is to sell leveraged funds when the index falls below the 200-day moving average (MA200) and buy back when it rises above it, claiming it can significantly improve returns. I did my own simulation and it seemed to work well. I&rsquo;d like to hear your thoughts.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This kind of market-timing strategy is useless. First, you&rsquo;ll encounter many &ldquo;whipsaws&rdquo; (false breakouts), leading to losses from selling high and buying low. Second, even if you successfully sell at the top (like in 2000), the biggest problem is when to buy back; human nature makes it very difficult. This operation seems clever, but its actual effect is often worse than the simple and effective &ldquo;hold and buy the dip&rdquo; strategy. We rely on asset allocation and cash reserves, not market timing.</li>

<li><strong>Share</strong>: After listening to the class for one or two months, my mindset has completely changed, from fearing I would &ldquo;outlive my savings&rdquo; to understanding that assets will grow on their own. I have invested 7 million in 513100 (CSI 300 ETF) and have another 3 million in cash.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: I plan to spend 200,000 a year on living expenses and withdraw a large sum from my investments to cover the next 20 years of living expenses when my cash runs down to a two or three-year supply. Is this okay? Also, is the annualized return of investing only in 513100 just 8-10%, lower than a 4-3-3 allocation? Can I retire now?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Your plan is fine; you don&rsquo;t need to rebalance every year. You have 10 million in assets and only spend 200,000 a year, you can absolutely retire. Asset allocation doesn&rsquo;t determine the final performance; the market does. You should retire early and enjoy life. If you haven&rsquo;t had children yet, you should hurry up and have them; that&rsquo;s more important than work.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: I have two children (one in college, one just started working), and they each have over 5 million TWD in assets. Should they invest directly in an underlying fund (00662) or use a 4-3-3 allocation?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: You must allocate cash for them. They are about to become independent and need their own emergency fund. You can&rsquo;t let them rely on their parents for everything. I suggest starting with an 80/20 (underlying/cash) allocation and don&rsquo;t use leveraged funds yet. Once they get used to investing, you can slowly add a small amount of leverage in the future. Don&rsquo;t let them experience large fluctuations from the start, as it might leave them with psychological scars.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: It seems that Taiwan&rsquo;s leveraged fund (00670L) recovers slower than America&rsquo;s QLD. Is there a problem with its management?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is mainly due to the TWD exchange rate and hedging costs. The correct comparison is between 00670L and 00662, as they are both priced in TWD. Historical data shows that the return of 00670L is more than double that of 00662, proving it has met its design objective.</li>

<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: My sister bought many savings-type life insurance policies. She has paid into some for 10 years, and surrendering them now would mean losing all the premiums paid. What should she do?

<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Surrender all of them. You win the moment you stop paying. Don&rsquo;t worry about how much you&rsquo;ve lost, because you still have decades of investing time ahead of you. Even if you only get a small amount back, investing it in an index fund will grow into a huge fortune after 40 years, far exceeding your current losses.</li>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: You used to work at Acer and were also a &ldquo;slave&rdquo; to capitalists. How did you adjust your mindset back then, having to work for capitalists while maintaining a sense of accomplishment?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: I started investing in my second year of work, so I was both a laborer and a capitalist. The key is that you must find a meaning and mission for your work that goes beyond the salary. My mission at that time was to design stable and reliable computers to serve the public. If you work only for a salary, you are a slave. But if you work to serve the public, you have found the meaning of life.</li>

<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Of course. The annualized return over the past five years has already reached 25%. We are now in the very early stages of the AI and digital finance revolution, like the TCP/IP infrastructure phase of the internet in the 1980s. The real application boom is far from here. The future growth potential is enormous; a 100-fold increase in 20 years is possible.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This question is impossible to answer. Asset allocation requires understanding your entire situation: age, family status (single/married/children), total annual expenses, whether you have a sufficient emergency fund, and whether this 200,000 is spare money. Without this information, it&rsquo;s impossible to give responsible advice. If this 200,000 is money you won&rsquo;t touch for 15-20 years and you already have an adequate emergency fund, then you can buy QQQ or 00662 all at once.</li>

<p>The core of this class is to establish a simple yet firm long-term investment philosophy. Teacher James emphasizes that investors should ignore market noise and short-term fluctuations, adhering to a strategy of &ldquo;buy, hold, and never sell.&rdquo; Successful investing requires not only the right asset allocation (especially using cash to build an &ldquo;anti-fragile&rdquo; portfolio) but also a strong psychological constitution, including steadfastness, patience, and faith, to ultimately achieve financial freedom and inner peace.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore Market Noise</strong>: Teacher James points out that in his 40 years of investing, almost all financial and political news and market analysis have been &ldquo;demons and monsters,&rdquo; useless for long-term investing. He quotes a student&rsquo;s message, emphasizing that social opinions and market volatility are irrelevant to long-term investors; enjoying the tranquility of the present is far more important than focusing on fleeting issues.</li>
<li><strong>The Best Strategy: Buy, Hold, Don&rsquo;t Sell</strong>: This is the core principle throughout. The art of investing lies not in complex market timing or stock picking, but in persistently holding high-quality assets for a lifetime, or even for generations.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Should Be Easy and Simple</strong>: The teacher uses an analogy: investing should only take 5-10 minutes a year and should not be a burden on one&rsquo;s life. If you make investing complicated, it&rsquo;s like adding a lot of chili oil to a simple clear noodle soup, which ruins the original flavor. Investors should spend more time enjoying life and being with their families.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Spicy Beef Noodle&rdquo; Theory</strong>: When asked about asset allocation ratios, the teacher uses a vivid example. He believes that asking someone else how to allocate your assets is like asking them how much chili to add to your beef noodles because everyone&rsquo;s risk tolerance (how much spice they can handle) is different.
<ul>
<li><strong>Advice for Beginners</strong>: For novices or those unsure of their risk tolerance, the teacher suggests starting with &ldquo;clear-broth beef noodles&rdquo; (a conservative allocation), for example, 50% of assets in the market and 50% in cash.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy for Large Sums of Capital</strong>: It is recommended to divide it into three parts: buy 1/3 immediately, buy 1/3 in batches, and keep 1/3 as cash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Three Elements of Investment Psychology: Steadfastness, Patience, Faith</strong>: Once you have bought in, the next step is to cultivate a strong psychological mindset.
<ul>
<li><strong>Steadfastness</strong>: Not being affected by market fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Patience</strong>: Enduring painful periods of market decline is a necessary psychological quality.</li>
<li><strong>Faith</strong>: Believing in the long-term upward trend of the market is the path to reaching the highest realm of investing.</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash and Market Volatility are &ldquo;Boosters&rdquo; for Assets</strong>: The teacher uses the concept of a &ldquo;boost converter&rdquo; in electronic circuits as an analogy. Market volatility is like an &ldquo;oscillator,&rdquo; and cash is like the &ldquo;electric current.&rdquo; Investing cash during a market downturn (oscillation) can effectively push asset values to new highs.</li>
<li><strong>Fragile vs. Anti-fragile</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Fragile Investment</strong>: For example, investing 100% in QQQ. If the market goes to zero, your assets go to zero. This is like a flower in a greenhouse that cannot withstand a storm.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-fragile Investment</strong>: For example, holding an index fund while keeping 30% in cash. Even if the market goes to zero, you still have 30% of your assets. This is like wildflowers everywhere, tenacious and able to survive and even thrive in harsh environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>An Anti-fragile Life</strong>: This concept applies not only to investing but also to life. For example, an employee who serves only one company is fragile and can be laid off at any time; whereas an Uber driver is anti-fragile, earning income as long as they drive. In the AI era, a pure software engineer becomes fragile, while experts in various industries who know how to use AI become anti-fragile.</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mathematical Explanation of Volatility Decay</strong>: The teacher reveals the characteristic of volatility decay in leveraged ETFs through calculation.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Assume QQQ falls for 45 consecutive days (-1% each day) and then rises for 46 consecutive days (+1% each day), it will eventually hit a new high.</li>
<li><strong>Comparison</strong>: Under the same conditions, if TQQQ falls for 45 consecutive days (-3% each day) and then rises for 46 consecutive days (+3% each day), its final price will still be below the initial starting point, unable to recover its losses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Who is Not Suitable for Leveraged Funds</strong>: Investors who are afraid of downturns and cannot withstand huge volatility should stay away from leveraged funds.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Use of Leveraged Funds</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Position Size Cannot Be Too Large</strong>: Investing a large sum of money into a high proportion of leveraged funds at once is very dangerous. In a long bear market, it could lead to assets going to zero with no chance of recovery.</li>
<li><strong>Suitable for Dollar-Cost Averaging</strong>: For investors with a continuous cash flow (like a monthly salary), making small, regular investments over decades is feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Warning</strong>: For retirees, a high leverage position could send you back to the workforce; for those currently employed, it could postpone your retirement plans indefinitely.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Live in the Present, Eliminate Worry</strong>: The teacher guides everyone to ponder a question: &ldquo;If tomorrow were the end of your life, could you depart with a smile?&rdquo; He believes that true happiness comes from &ldquo;dying without regrets.&rdquo; If you have regrets in life, you should remedy them now, not spend your days worrying.</li>
<li><strong>Happiness is a Human Right</strong>: Investing should be joyful. If it causes you pain, don&rsquo;t participate. The value of life is not in its length, but in its depth and brightness.</li>

<ol>
<li>A new member from last week, he is very grateful to Teacher James for his quick email response, which solved his problem with the app&rsquo;s operation.</li>
<li>He combines his insights from reading with the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy to create daily reminders for his investment principles: have capital, an investment philosophy, discipline, patience, and luck, combined with the teacher&rsquo;s &ldquo;hear, know, understand, believe, execute, firmly believe.&rdquo;</li>
<li>He quotes a conversation between Warren Buffett and Bill Gates to emphasize the principle of &ldquo;getting rich slowly,&rdquo; believing that patience is the most difficult but most crucial part of investing.</li>
<li>He shares his past principles for selling individual stocks (the reason for buying disappears, the target price is reached, the company faces irreversible difficulties), but now he has found a better option (QQQ) and is liquidating his individual stocks.</li>
<li>Regarding real estate, he believes that a house is also a financial product and proposes a view: &ldquo;Houses aren&rsquo;t bought by people, they&rsquo;re bought by money,&rdquo; with its price driven by market liquidity. He thinks the reason real estate returns are sometimes very high is due to high leverage (e.g., 5x or even 10x). His family owns a jewelry store, and he suggests that high-net-worth individuals can allocate a small amount to gold as a hedge against extreme risks.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Question: The &ldquo;Nine Scenarios&rdquo; PDF file he downloaded shows overlapping text and numbers on his phone. He asks if he can get the link again.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is likely a display issue with his personal phone, as there is no problem with the link itself. He suggests trying to open it on a computer or asking family or friends for help.</li>

<li>Sharing: He found that in the Chinese market, the management fee for the Harvest Nasdaq ETF (159501) is 0.2% lower than the 513100 recommended by the teacher, believing it will make a difference in long-term returns.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: The market is very efficient; this small fee difference is unlikely to bring extra profit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: How to change his parents&rsquo; investment mindset? He details the painful experience of his father suffering severe losses due to high-risk investments and being deceived by relatives. This has led his parents to be extremely risk-averse, preferring to deposit tens of millions of RMB in a bank for a fixed term (with an annual interest rate of only about 1.5%) and refusing to touch any funds. They even believe that real estate is the most secure asset. He feels confused and doesn&rsquo;t know if he should continue to persuade them.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t try to change them. Everyone&rsquo;s &ldquo;psychology of money&rdquo; is shaped by their life experiences. His parents&rsquo; views are &ldquo;correct&rdquo; in their world, a way to protect themselves from further harm. What you should do is manage your own money, invest your own funds, and become a big tree yourself. When you become very wealthy, your parents might see it, but changing them is not your responsibility. The most important thing is to let them live a peaceful and happy life.</li>

<li>She believes investors should first have an attitude of self-responsibility instead of just seeking answers from the teacher. She spent over a year studying the teacher&rsquo;s courses very seriously, treating investing like a startup project, so her mindset is very stable.</li>
<li>She suggests new students (like Zhang Le) need to give themselves and their investment strategy some time, using three or four years of results to prove it to their parents, rather than trying to convince their family as soon as they start.</li>
<li>She has observed that the teacher is constantly changing and growing, giving different advice based on different students&rsquo; situations, such as once advising Taiwanese investors who needed stable cash flow to allocate a portion to high-dividend ETFs.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: He is in a good mood; his low tone of voice is because he is very calm inside, which is a very good state. He will not be influenced by the outside world and uses a joke about &ldquo;not wrestling with a pig&rdquo; to illustrate that for people who cannot understand, there is no need to argue, just say &ldquo;you are right.&rdquo; He emphasizes that he is growing and changing every day; otherwise, he would be stagnant.</li>

When a person sees through many things and their heart is not troubled by any person or event, they will reach a very peaceful state. This requires nurturing one&rsquo;s spirituality, learning to &ldquo;separate&rdquo; from certain things, and taking back control of one&rsquo;s life, daring to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to things you don&rsquo;t want.</li>

<li>During a ROTH conversion, can he transfer stocks (in-kind) directly from a traditional IRA to a brokerage account, instead of selling and then transferring?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Keeping an extra 10% in cash is of course safer.</li>
<li>The remaining money can continue to be invested according to the 4-3-3 ratio.</li>
<li>Borrow as needed. For example, borrow only when you need to pay a bill this week; don&rsquo;t borrow in advance and let it sit.</li>
<li>Yes, stocks can be transferred in-kind. The brokerage will automatically adjust your cost basis based on the market value on the day of the transfer.</li>

<li>Having followed the teacher for nearly 6 years, financial freedom has given him time for philanthropy, such as teaching indigenous communities. He noticed an interesting phenomenon: people are afraid of their health indexes (like blood sugar) going up, but they hope their wealth index (QQQ) goes up every day.</li>
<li>He mentioned hearing Howard Marks quote Warren Buffett on the &ldquo;Macro Insights&rdquo; program and then add: &ldquo;You never bet against the United States, and you never bet against China.&rdquo; He wanted to hear the teacher&rsquo;s opinion.</li>
<li>He observed the tech talent war between the US and China. Regardless of where the talent flows, it ultimately converges in the tech giants, which is a long-term positive for QQQ.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: What Howard Marks means is that the first choice for investment is still the US, but you shouldn&rsquo;t be bearish on China either, because its potential is huge. Therefore, you can choose not to be &ldquo;long&rdquo; China, but you should never &ldquo;short&rdquo; China. The focus of investment should remain on the United States.</li>

<li>She finds it strange when some students say their assets are still &ldquo;underwater.&rdquo; She shares her own early mistake: listening to others and buying penny stocks that didn&rsquo;t rise for years. Later, she came to her senses, decisively &ldquo;cut her losses,&rdquo; sold the bad stocks, and switched to quality assets (QQQ, 2x leveraged NVDA, etc.).</li>
<li>She uses one of her accounts as an example: it suffered severe losses during the big drop in April, but after she decisively rebalanced her portfolio, the account&rsquo;s return reached 75% within 3 months, not only recovering all losses but also earning over $50,000.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>All information is a demon or a monster; in 40 years, no information has ever been useful.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view emphasizes the importance of ignoring short-term market noise and sticking to a long-term investment strategy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asking me how to do your asset allocation is like asking me how much chili to add to your beef noodles.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view vividly illustrates the personalized nature of asset allocation. Everyone&rsquo;s risk tolerance is different, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What our asset allocation needs to achieve is a state of &ldquo;anti-fragility.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view introduces the core concept of &ldquo;anti-fragility,&rdquo; which is to build an investment portfolio that can survive and retain strength even in extreme risk scenarios (like the market going to zero).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to raise a child than to maintain a house.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view reflects on the phenomenon in modern society where people sacrifice their quality of life, and even the desire to have children, for the sake of real estate, emphasizing the importance of life&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He who can buy is a grandson, he who can sell is a father, but he who never sells is a god.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view uses a colloquial analogy to highly praise the ultimate state of investing: &ldquo;hold for the long term, never sell.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Houses aren&rsquo;t bought by people, they&rsquo;re bought by money.
&ndash; Bruce</p></blockquote>
<p>This view points out the essence of the real estate market, whose price fluctuations are primarily driven by monetary liquidity rather than just the housing needs of the population.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t even manage the little bit of money in your hands, then don&rsquo;t go selling your house, and don&rsquo;t go taking out loans.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view advises investors to proceed step by step, starting with small amounts of capital and proving their ability to manage investments well before considering the use of larger-scale funds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investing can cultivate the mind.

<p>This view highlights another dimension of investing: through the process of managing wealth and dealing with market fluctuations, investors can cultivate their character and achieve inner peace.</p>

<p>This session lucidly explains Teacher James&rsquo;s core investment philosophy and life wisdom. Starting from the simple principle of &ldquo;buy, hold, don&rsquo;t sell,&rdquo; it extends to the sophisticated strategy of using cash to build an &ldquo;anti-fragile&rdquo; portfolio, and then to a profound analysis of the risks of leveraged ETFs, providing investors with a clear guide to action. More importantly, the class transcends purely financial discussion, closely linking investment with personal psychological growth, family happiness, and inner peace. Through vivid analogies and real student cases, the teacher guides everyone to realize that true financial freedom is not just about numerical growth, but about breaking free from fear and anxiety, gaining the ability to control one&rsquo;s life and enjoy the present moment. At the same time, the teacher also reminds students that investment philosophy is constantly evolving and growing, requiring continuous learning and follow-up, otherwise, one becomes like a &ldquo;lost lamb,&rdquo; disconnected from the latest understanding.</p>

<p>The core message of this session is that ordinary investors should adopt a minimalist yet highly effective investment strategy: <strong>long-term holding of the Nasdaq-100 index fund (QQQ) and using asset-backed loans to cover living expenses. This allows them to enjoy the compound growth of their assets while legally avoiding capital gains tax and income tax.</strong> Through data and examples, James contrasts the inevitable losses of short-term traders with the steady wealth accumulation of long-term investors, emphasizing that &ldquo;Persistence, Patience, and Faith&rdquo; are the only things that matter in investing.</p>

<li><strong>The Market Always Reaches New Highs</strong>: For long-term investors, there is no &ldquo;highest point&rdquo; for the market, only &ldquo;higher.&rdquo; Buying at any time is a low point from a long-term perspective. The peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 now seems like an extremely low price.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Risk and Asset Allocation</strong>: Investing involves risk; the market could drop by 50%-70%. The best way to manage risk is not through frequent trading but by proper asset allocation and holding enough cash to withstand market volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Our Investment Choice</strong>: We focus solely on investing in the Nasdaq-100 index fund (QQQ). Page 11 of the course notes lists corresponding funds in various countries. Please do not ask about other complex funds; simplifying your investment is key.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Requires Extreme Optimism</strong>: You must firmly believe that the market will eventually go up, always looking on the bright side. Wealth is worth waiting for; investing requires patience.</li>

<li><strong>Final Result</strong>: The total loss amounted to NT$11.7 billion. This proves that short-term trading is almost a guaranteed losing game after all costs are deducted. Traders often only remember the &ldquo;good feeling&rdquo; of a single trade but overlook the total costs.</li>

<li><strong>Second Exploitation</strong>: You invest the after-tax money ($600,000), and any profits are then hit with capital gains tax (e.g., 25%).</li>
<li>Throughout a lifetime, assets are eroded by various taxes (VAT, estate tax, etc.), and you may only be left with a small fraction in the end.</li>

<li><strong>Borrow Against Assets</strong>: Use the stocks as collateral to borrow money from a bank for living expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Taxes</strong>: The borrowed money is <strong>debt</strong>, not <strong>income</strong>, so no tax is due. Meanwhile, the stock assets held as collateral continue to grow in the market. This is the most favorable wealth-building cycle in the world.</li>

<li><strong>The Most Important Thing in Investing</strong>: Adhere to these three things: &ldquo;<strong>Persistence, Patience, and Faith</strong>.&rdquo; Everything else (how to buy, how to sell) is unimportant. We only teach how to buy, not how to sell.</li>
<li><strong>Knowing When to Stop Brings Stability</strong>: Quoting a share from student Barin, James emphasizes the importance of &ldquo;knowing when to stop.&rdquo; This is a form of self-restraint after reflection, knowing when to apply the brakes between greed and fear and avoiding maxing out leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Getting Rich Once is Enough</strong>: One only needs to get rich slowly once in a lifetime. True wealth is not about how much money you have, but about living with ease and not being constrained by money. A higher realm is to help others achieve wealth together.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to Spend Money Smartly</strong>: The best state in life is to be <strong>&ldquo;in heaven, with money in the bank&rdquo;</strong> (meaning your money runs out just as you pass away). Young people don&rsquo;t need to invest every penny; they can plan their retirement goals and enjoy life appropriately, making their youth more meaningful.</li>

You can&rsquo;t teach your children when to sell TSMC; they might panic and sell at a low point. In contrast, the strategy for index funds (hold long-term, never sell) is simple, clear, and easy to pass on.

<li>Question: I run a small business in Taiwan, pay a lot in taxes, and the work is very hard. I want to retire and put all my assets into 00662, but I&rsquo;m afraid of feeling insecure without cash flow. What should I do?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: First, you need to calculate your business&rsquo;s <strong>net profit margin</strong>. If your net profit margin isn&rsquo;t significantly higher than QQQ&rsquo;s annualized return (around 18%, say, less than 30%), then continuing the business doesn&rsquo;t make much sense, as you&rsquo;re taking on huge risks and hardship for a lower return. Regarding the cash flow issue, you can solve it with <strong>asset allocation</strong>: hold 30% of your total assets (or enough to cover 15 years of living expenses) in cash or cash equivalents (like 00865B), and invest the remaining 70% in 00662. This way, you&rsquo;ll have enough cash to live on, while the stock portion continues to grow. In the long run, you won&rsquo;t run out of assets.</li>

<li>Question: My son is 30. He can contribute $7,000 to a Roth IRA and $23,000 to a SEP IRA. How should he allocate this?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>I strongly recommend avoiding any Traditional (pre-tax) accounts</strong>. The tax you save now will be paid back at a higher rate in the future. First, you should find a brokerage that offers a <strong>Roth SEP IRA</strong>. If you can&rsquo;t find one, then <strong>do not contribute to the SEP IRA</strong>. It&rsquo;s better to put the money in a regular Brokerage Account. Assets in a brokerage account are never taxed until they are sold, whereas money in a Traditional account is subject to Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) and taxes after age 75. As for allocation, all Roth accounts can buy QQQ. For the Roth IRA, given its small amount and long-term dollar-cost averaging nature, you could consider the more aggressive <strong>TQQQ</strong>.</li>

<li>Question 1: An investment scenario: A brother invests 10 million and withdraws 200,000 annually. The market then drops 50%, leaving his assets at 5.8 million. At this point, his younger brother invests 5.8 million with the same allocation. Can the younger brother also withdraw 200,000 annually?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>Yes</strong>. Because the younger brother entered the market after a major crash when the risk was lower, he is &ldquo;luckier.&rdquo; The older brother initially used a low 2% withdrawal rate precisely to create a buffer for such a crash. After the risk event has occurred, the younger brother&rsquo;s withdrawal rate, although seemingly higher (about 3.45%), is based on a different risk foundation, so it is feasible.</li>

<li>Question 2: The Taiwan dollar has appreciated, making it seem like 00662 hasn&rsquo;t recovered to its previous high. Can I, for psychological purposes, add back the currency loss and consider it to have broken even?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>No</strong>. You cannot use a hypothetical, favorable exchange rate to calculate your asset value; this creates high risk. Investments should be based on their current, actual value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: If a geopolitical war happens in Taiwan, our cash equivalents (like 00865B) are also in the market. Is there a risk?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t worry about black swan events you can&rsquo;t control. If a war really happens, whether your stock account is untradable or goes to zero will be the least of your worries.</li>

When you leave the company, you can roll over the entire 401K account (including the pre-tax portion) to your own IRA, and do a Roth conversion at that time.</li>

<li>Question 1: I&rsquo;m retired and enjoy day trading in my retirement account for fun. I find it entertaining, is this okay?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: If you&rsquo;re just doing it for &ldquo;fun&rdquo; and are willing to pay the &ldquo;ticket price&rdquo; (i.e., giving up the massive potential returns from long-term holding of QQQ), then of course you can. But this is just making small money while giving up the opportunity to make big money. For example, a $100,000 principal held for 40 years could become $200 million; day trading can&rsquo;t achieve that.</li>

<li>Question 2: What about high-dividend option strategy ETFs like YieldMax (e.g., TSLY)?

<li>Question: My current asset allocation is 40% cash, 20% leveraged funds, and 40% QQQ. The money borrowed through credit and mortgage refinancing accounts for about 12% of my total assets. Is this risk level high?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: As long as you are still working and your monthly income can fully cover the loan interest and living expenses, this ratio is fine. By the time you retire, your total assets will have grown significantly, and this small loan will become negligible relative to your total assets, and you can easily pay it off then.</li>

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: You need to resolve the human issue through communication yourself. But the <strong>top priority must be to make your family&rsquo;s cash flow positive</strong>. When taking out the loan, you should choose a long enough term to ensure that the monthly payment plus living expenses is less than your monthly income. You absolutely must not invest when your cash flow is negative. After solving the cash flow problem, you can then allocate the borrowed funds using a 433 (40% QQQ, 30% QLD, 30% cash) or another configuration.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>We borrow money to spend without paying taxes, and our money in the stock market assets grows forever, always up, how great is that! This is the best thing in the world.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote brilliantly summarizes the core advantage of using asset-backed loans for consumption: achieving tax exemption for spending while enjoying the compound growth of assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We only need to get rich once in our lifetime. We don&rsquo;t need to be rich from the start; just get rich slowly.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This sentence conveys the patience and calm mindset of long-term investing, opposing the speculative psychology of rushing for success and emphasizing that wealth accumulation is a continuous and steady process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The highest skill in investing is to exist in a state of &rsquo;non-eventfulness,&rsquo; where the market basically doesn&rsquo;t exist&hellip; The market&rsquo;s ups and downs have nothing to do with us.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This describes the ultimate psychological state a long-term investor should aspire to: being completely unaffected by short-term market fluctuations because their investment strategy is independent of short-term movements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you look at anything from a long-term perspective, you will see it clearly.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>In answering how to see the essence of things, James emphasizes the importance of the time dimension. A decision may seem reasonable in the present, but when viewed over a span of decades, the conclusion might be completely different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can make 20 billion from short-term trading, can you really get that 20 billion? If you have 1 million now and you can&rsquo;t get 20 billion in 60 years, then don&rsquo;t do it, you&rsquo;re wasting your time. Because you can have 20 billion by doing nothing.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>When discussing short-term trading with a student, James uses a high-impact numerical comparison to reveal the enormous opportunity cost difference between short-term trading and long-term index holding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned one sentence now, which is, &lsquo;I might be wrong&rsquo;&hellip; Only when we acknowledge our ignorance do we begin to learn.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>At the end of the session, this quote shared by James demonstrates the humility and open-mindedness of an investment master, emphasizing that admitting ignorance is the starting point for continuous learning and progress.</p>

<p>This session was an intensive training in mindset and strategy. James once again emphasized the overwhelming advantage of the core strategy of long-term holding of index funds (QQQ) and used detailed data to reveal the inevitable failure of short-term trading. The highlight of this session was the clear explanation of the &ldquo;wealthy&rsquo;s tax strategy&rdquo;—asset-backed loans—providing investors with a path to achieve both wealth growth and tax optimization. The entire session was imbued with the investment philosophy of &ldquo;Persistence, Patience, and Faith,&rdquo; and through interactive Q&amp;A with numerous students, it addressed a series of specific issues from asset allocation, retirement planning, and children&rsquo;s education to international tax matters, vividly demonstrating how to integrate investment wisdom into real-life decision-making.</p>

<p>The core theme of this session is to emphasize that long-term investors should ignore short-term market volatility and firmly believe in the market&rsquo;s perpetual upward trend. Teacher James points out that having funds out of the market is the biggest risk, and investors should enter the market as soon as possible, adopting a &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, and never sell&rdquo; strategy. By debunking common market prediction indicators (like the Buffett Indicator) and analyzing asset allocation, he aims to help investors build a solid investment mindset to achieve long-term wealth growth.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market Volatility Doesn&rsquo;t Concern Me</strong>: For long-term investors, daily market fluctuations, global situations, tariff wars, etc., should not influence investment decisions. The market hitting new highs for three consecutive days proves the importance of staying in the market.</li>
<li><strong>Being Out of the Market is the Biggest Risk</strong>: Many people exit the market fearing a downturn, but waiting for a correction might mean never getting back in. Keeping funds out of the market and missing out on gains is a far greater risk than a short-term decline.</li>
<li><strong>Predictions are Useless, Making Money is What Matters</strong>: There are many who make correct market predictions, but the ones who actually make money are those who ignore the predictions and stay invested.</li>
<li><strong>The Market Always Goes Up</strong>: This is the core belief a long-term investor must have. Historical data proves that in the long run, the market only goes up and will always reach new highs. Investors should always be extremely optimistic and face the sun.</li>
<li><strong>Review the Past, Preview the Future</strong>: The teacher advises students, especially new ones, to watch videos from the market crashes at the end of 2018, March 2020, and in 2022 to learn how to react correctly during times of panic and to mentally prepare for future market volatility.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>No Risk in Long-Term Investing</strong>: Looking at a century of history, buying at any point and holding for the long term has always been profitable. However, short-term volatility can be immense, with potential drops of 50% or even 80%, so one must focus on long-term returns.</li>
<li><strong>The Nature of Your Funds Dictates Your Investment</strong>: Money needed for the short term (like tuition or a down payment for a house) must absolutely not be invested in the stock market; it should be kept as cash. Only long-term funds that you won&rsquo;t touch for 10-20 years are suitable for investment.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Asset Allocation</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Seek Stability Before Returns</strong>: Investment allocation should prioritize psychological stability. It is inadvisable for people to switch from an aggressive allocation (e.g., 442) to a conservative one (e.g., 433) when they can&rsquo;t handle the pressure during a market drop (like in April of this year).</li>
<li><strong>A Conservative Beta Value</strong>: It is recommended that an investor&rsquo;s Beta value not exceed 1.0. If you think you can handle 1.0, it&rsquo;s better to subtract 0.2 and adopt a Beta of 0.8, which might be more suitable.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Sufficient Cash</strong>: It&rsquo;s advisable to keep at least 30% in cash. For example, a portfolio of 70% QQQ + 30% Cash.</li>
<li><strong>Gradual Increase in Leverage</strong>: Newcomers to the market can start without using leveraged funds. During a market dip, you can use a small amount of cash (e.g., 2% of assets) to buy a 2x leveraged fund, thereby gradually building a leveraged position and allowing the Beta value to increase naturally as the market rises. This is like riding a smooth, high-class train rather than a bumpy race car.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Case: Currency Exchange Impact on 00662 vs. QLD</strong>
<ul>
<li>A student asked if the performance of 00662 (Fubon NASDAQ-100) lagged behind QLD due to the appreciation of the Taiwan Dollar (TWD).</li>
<li><strong>Teacher&rsquo;s Analysis</strong>: Comparisons must be made in the same currency. Assuming the exchange rate was 33 when investing in QQQ and is now 29, the exchange loss is 12%. Over the past 5 years, QLD&rsquo;s performance was about 128%, and 00662&rsquo;s was about 114%. However, after deducting the 12% currency exchange loss from QLD&rsquo;s 128%, its performance becomes about 112%, which is actually lower than 00662&rsquo;s 114%. The conclusion is that their performances are essentially the same; don&rsquo;t be misled by nominal figures in different currencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Debunking the &ldquo;Buffett Indicator&rdquo; Myth</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Many people use the &ldquo;Total Stock Market Capitalization / GDP&rdquo; ratio to judge if the market is overheated, which is wrong.</li>
<li><strong>GDP is a flow concept</strong>: It only measures the new value added in the current year.</li>
<li><strong>Market Cap is a stock concept</strong>: It includes the value of all of a company&rsquo;s historical investments and accumulated value.</li>
<li>Comparing a changing flow metric to a cumulative stock metric is like comparing apples and oranges; it&rsquo;s completely illogical.</li>
<li>Warren Buffett himself rarely mentions this indicator and emphasizes not to use a single indicator to judge the market. Many &ldquo;pundits&rdquo; and bloggers on the market abuse this concept just to get attention, like mindless &ldquo;parrots.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Beware of Investment Scams</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Teacher James <strong>solemnly declares</strong> that he provides <strong>completely free</strong> and <strong>voluntary teaching</strong>. He will never contact students privately, let alone offer financial services for a 1% fee or any other charge.</li>
<li>Anyone who uses his name on platforms like LINE or WeChat to contact you, claiming they can manage your finances for a fee, is a <strong>scammer</strong>.</li>
<li>In the US, it is illegal for an uncertified financial advisor to charge fees. The teacher stresses that no one cares more about your assets than you do; you must manage your investments yourself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Awakening to Capitalism</strong>: Teacher James puts forward a sharp point: laborers who go to work in modern society are, in essence, &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; of capitalism. The purpose of his teaching is to awaken everyone&rsquo;s &ldquo;capitalist consciousness,&rdquo; to learn to use capitalism to become capitalists, rather than being enslaved by it. (Refer to video <code>00315</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Ultimate Goals in Life</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Health and Longevity are Fundamental</strong>: Longevity is the path to wealth, and health is the mother of happiness. He reminds everyone to get health check-ups (like CT scans).</li>
<li><strong>Happiness is the purpose of life</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth is just the icing on the cake</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>The Principle of Borrowing to Invest</strong>:
<ul>
<li>For money borrowed according to proper principles, <strong>never think about paying it back</strong>.</li>
<li>Once you repay the loan, your risk (Beta value) will immediately increase. For example, an investor with 50% cash and 50% QQQ (Beta=0.5) who uses cash to repay a loan will see their Beta value skyrocket, greatly increasing their risk.</li>
<li>Having cash on hand gives you the confidence to face risks.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is a 65-year-old veteran investor who lost tens of millions in the stock market twice. After starting to learn Teacher James&rsquo;s philosophy after the Chinese New Year, although he had doubts about some points (about 10-15%), he found through deeper study that the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy is continuously refined and has deep logic.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: The market often says, &ldquo;If you miss the best few days of gains, your annualized return will drop significantly.&rdquo; What is the specific definition of this &ldquo;best time for gains&rdquo;?</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Regarding &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; versus &ldquo;mindless rebalancing,&rdquo; if the market is still rising at the end of the year, will rebalancing then cause one to miss out on subsequent gains?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>On Missing Up Days</strong>: This is precisely why it&rsquo;s important &ldquo;not to leave the market.&rdquo; Attempting to time the market will very likely cause you to miss the days with the biggest gains, leading to long-term returns far worse than those of an investor who &ldquo;never sells.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>On Rebalancing</strong>: Attempting &ldquo;smart,&rdquo; irregular rebalancing based on market movements is <strong>active investing</strong>, which cannot be taught because everyone&rsquo;s judgment criteria are different (add at a 10% drop? or 20%?). This approach can deplete your cash in an extreme market (like a three-year decline), leading to bankruptcy. Therefore, the simplest, safest, and most replicable method is to <strong>rebalance once a year</strong>. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that you didn&rsquo;t add more at the low point in April this year, because by the end of the year, your entire portfolio will still have appreciated significantly.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: For a portfolio of 60% QQQ, 10% QLD, and 30% cash, what is the Beta value? (Teacher&rsquo;s reply: 0.6 + 0.1*2 = 0.8)</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Can one use technical indicators (like the 200-day moving average) to assist in decision-making—becoming conservative when the price is below the average and aggressive when it&rsquo;s above?</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: Are people like Apple CEO Tim Cook considered capitalists or laborers?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>On Technical Indicators</strong>: Completely unnecessary. In the recent V-shaped recovery, using a 200-day moving average strategy would have had you sell and buy back at roughly the same point. Not only would you not have made a profit, you might have lost money on transaction fees, underperforming a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; strategy.</li>
<li><strong>On Tim Cook</strong>: He is a <strong>laborer</strong>, a very highly paid &ldquo;slave.&rdquo; His wealth comes from his salary (including stock options), not from returns on his own invested capital. True capitalists do not have to go to work.</li>

<li>Influenced by family, she previously invested in real estate. Her property in Japan yielded poor returns due to the yen&rsquo;s major depreciation over the last decade.</li>
<li>Shared a success story: she took out a home loan of 8 million TWD four or five years ago and didn&rsquo;t pay it off early. Instead, she invested the funds in ETFs and made a profit of four to five million, deeply understanding the benefits of investing with borrowed money.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: What should she do with the Japanese Yen she holds?</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: She has about $200,000 USD in cash (cost basis ~32 TWD/USD) and has already invested $100,000 in US stocks (QQQ/SPY/VT). Now she doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with the remaining cash because she heard the teacher say there are tax issues for Taiwanese people buying US stocks.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Handling the Yen</strong>: Immediately, right now, exchange it for TWD and buy 00662. Don&rsquo;t worry about the exchange rate loss, because the potential return from the stock market is far greater than currency fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Handling the USD Assets</strong>: Again, ignore the exchange rate. For Taiwanese investors, the best approach is to sell the holdings in the US brokerage, transfer the funds back to Taiwan, and buy 00662 with all of it to avoid future estate tax issues. In the long run, the exchange rates for entering and exiting the market will average out, so there&rsquo;s no need for excessive worry.</li>

All new funds in the future should be invested in QQQ. In the future, Bitcoin might be used as collateral like gold, so you may not need to sell it.

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is 65 and retired. During the recent downturn, his allocation was too aggressive (Beta 1.1), and he had no cash to add at the bottom. He has now adjusted to a Beta of 0.9 (70% QQQ, 10% QLD, 20% Cash).</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Is there a mechanical rule for deploying cash during a major market drop? For example, investing one-third of the cash when the market drops 20%?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This falls under active management. If you must do it, you could consider this: when the market drops 10% (happens almost every year), you can add more once; when it drops 20% (happens every few years), you can add more again. If it continues to fall, you must be very cautious, as it could be a major bear market. At that point, you should switch to a defensive posture, not continue to add. The key is to <strong>never run out of cash</strong>, and the goal of adding to your position is to <strong>maintain your original Beta value (0.9)</strong>, not to raise it.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is due to the <strong>volatility decay</strong> characteristic of leveraged ETFs. In volatile and declining markets, the drop in leveraged ETFs will be more than a multiple of the index&rsquo;s drop, and their recovery is also slower. This is why a full position in leveraged funds is not recommended. For those holding leveraged funds, adding to your position during a major market drop can help you break even faster. For those with a salary, you should normally buy QQQ and use your salary to buy TQQQ during major market dips.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Being out of the market is actually the biggest risk.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This point was central to the entire session. The teacher repeatedly emphasized that compared to the risk of a short-term market decline, the risk of investors exiting out of fear and thereby missing out on huge long-term returns is far greater.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today&rsquo;s laborers who go to work are like the cotton pickers brought from Africa to America in the past. All who work in factories today are slaves to capitalism.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a very sharp and thought-provoking view from the teacher, aimed at awakening people to the nature of capitalism and encouraging them to become capitalists through investment, thereby escaping the status of a &ldquo;laborer.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Longevity is the path to wealth, happiness is the purpose of life, health is the mother of happiness, and wealth is just the icing on the cake.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher shared his philosophy of life, emphasizing what is truly important. Wealth is meant to serve a better life, not be the ultimate goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone says, &ldquo;Pay me 1% and I can be your investment advisor&rdquo;&hellip; that is a scam.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher directly used the language of scammers as an example to strongly remind all students that anyone impersonating him and offering paid financial advice is a scam, urging everyone to protect their assets.</p>

<p>This session once again stressed the core discipline of long-term investing: ignore short-term market volatility and firmly believe in the market&rsquo;s long-term upward trend. By analyzing asset allocation, the use of leveraged funds, and debunking common myths like the Buffett Indicator, Teacher James pointed out a simple yet effective path to wealth growth. The Q&amp;A session was rich in content, covering profound discussions from specific investment strategies (like rebalancing timing and leveraged fund allocation) to life philosophies (such as dealing with bullying and the nature of capitalism). The central idea of the entire session is that investors should build a strong psychological foundation, focus on controllable investment principles, and simultaneously pursue a life of health, happiness, and longevity, viewing wealth as a tool for a better life, not the ultimate goal.</p>

<p>This session revolves around &ldquo;The Long-term Practice of Investment Mindset and Asset Allocation.&rdquo; The core message is that investors should cultivate a transcendent mindset of &ldquo;it has nothing to do with me,&rdquo; remaining calm in the face of external factors like international situations and economic data, and firmly believing that the market will trend upwards and reach new highs in the long run. It emphasizes achieving financial freedom through reasonable asset allocation (e.g., Nasdaq 100 index funds combined with ample cash) and passive management, and drawing strength for life and investment from wisdom such as &ldquo;I might be wrong&rdquo; and &ldquo;life is worthwhile.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Market Irrelevance Theory</strong>: Macro factors like international situations, financial reports, economic data, and interest rate decisions have no direct correlation with an individual investor&rsquo;s long-term success. One should adopt a mindset of &ldquo;it all has nothing to do with me.&rdquo; Market volatility is normal and not worth worrying about, as you can&rsquo;t control it anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Always Be Extremely Optimistic</strong>: Firmly believe that the market will inevitably rise and set new historical highs in the long run. Investing requires patience, and wealth is worth the trouble and the wait.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended Books/Films for the Mind</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>&ldquo;I Might Be Wrong&rdquo;</strong> (The Illumination of a Forest Sage): This book recounts the life insights of a man (from Europe, as the teacher recalls) who spent over a decade (perhaps 14 or 16 years) as a monk in a Thai forest. The core takeaway is to tell yourself &ldquo;I might be wrong&rdquo; three times before arguing or getting angry, to calm your mind and self-reflect. It emphasizes practicing the state of &ldquo;no-self&rdquo; and learning to live harmoniously with all kinds of people.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Life is Worthwhile&rdquo;</strong> (Audiobook): This book contains the professional insights and life experiences of an elderly female Japanese psychiatrist. Through numerous patient cases, it explores how many psychological barriers stem from &ldquo;attachment.&rdquo; Her life experiences (e.g., maintaining a less-than-perfect marriage until her husband passed away in his 70s so that both parents could stand on the stage at their children&rsquo;s weddings) are thought-provoking. The core message is to let go of attachments and appreciate life. The teacher believes that, aside from the somewhat fatalistic view on marriage, the book is very beneficial for one&rsquo;s outlook on life.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Boredom is the Highest State</strong>: &ldquo;Hold stocks in your hand, but not their prices in your heart.&rdquo; True investing should be boring, requiring only 5 minutes of operation and review each year. If it feels exciting, you&rsquo;re likely speculating or gambling, as if you&rsquo;re in Las Vegas.</li>
<li><strong>Coping with Anxiety</strong>: Don&rsquo;t create your own troubles in life. If you can handle something, face it and get it done. If you can&rsquo;t, since it&rsquo;s beyond your control, let it go without worry.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Importance of Cash is King</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>For Retirees</strong>: It&rsquo;s recommended to hold total assets equivalent to 50 times your annual expenses. Of this, 30% of your assets (equivalent to 15 years of living expenses) should be held in cash or short-term treasury bonds. With 15 years of living expenses in cash, nothing in the world concerns you.</li>
<li><strong>For Working Individuals</strong>: You usually can&rsquo;t hold 15 years&rsquo; worth of cash. You should continue to save and invest, and the world&rsquo;s affairs also have nothing to do with you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Ultimate Perspective of Life</strong>: In life-or-death moments (like the last day of your life), wealth, stock losses, and asset security become irrelevant. Therefore, don&rsquo;t worry excessively about things you can&rsquo;t control in daily life.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Asset Allocation Principles (Pledged Investing)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Beta Control</strong>: The initial Beta of your asset allocation should not exceed 1.0. For example, a 40% non-leveraged fund (QQQ) + 30% leveraged fund (QLD) + 30% cash (433 allocation) is an aggressive setup. A 40% QQQ + 20% QLD + 40% cash (424 allocation, Beta 0.8) is also a solid choice. Aggressive allocations like 442, where the Beta might exceed 1.2, are not recommended at the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Proportion Limits</strong>: The market value of the leveraged fund should not exceed that of the non-leveraged fund, nor should it exceed the cash position.</li>
<li><strong>Prudent Choices</strong>: Even without using leveraged funds, a pledged allocation like 70% QQQ + 30% cash, or 60% QQQ + 40% cash, can withstand risk tests. Prioritize stability, with returns being secondary.</li>
<li><strong>Coping with Extreme Scenarios</strong>: This allocation must be able to withstand a market downturn lasting 10 years, like the one in 2000 (in reality, it took about 13-15 years for the market to fully recover and significantly surpass its previous high).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Role of Cash</strong>: Cash is key to protecting the safety of your long-term investments (the &ldquo;army&rdquo; of non-leveraged funds and the &ldquo;marines&rdquo; of leveraged funds).</li>
<li><strong>The Worst-Case Scenario Principle</strong>: Envision the worst possible situation and create a plan to deal with it. Once you have a solution, anxiety will diminish. For example, if you get laid off, the worst case is being unable to find a job for a year. Plan how to prepare funds and how to find a temporary job for cash flow. For disasters beyond your control that you can&rsquo;t prevent (like a nuclear war, as Buffett mentioned, or a meteor hitting Earth), worrying is useless, so let it go.</li>
<li><strong>A Long-Term Investor&rsquo;s Perspective</strong>: Don&rsquo;t fear market downturns; instead, fear that the market rises too quickly, preventing you from buying enough (like the market&rsquo;s rapid rebound after the tariff war). Downturns are buying opportunities. Resolutely do not sell core assets (like QQQ, 00662). It takes multiple experiences (e.g., 7 major slumps) to learn to buy the dip. You can choose not to buy, but you must never sell.</li>
<li><strong>Discipline for Leveraged Investing</strong>: A reminder that for leveraged investing, the initial cash allocation must exceed 30% (40% is also fine), with limits on the proportion of leveraged funds and a Beta not exceeding 1.0. This is emphasized because too many people ask the same questions and make allocation mistakes.</li>

Teacher James is dedicated to this, hoping to awaken more people to capitalism and that his followers will pass on the philosophy, change the world, and free themselves and those around them from financial worries.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Resources</strong>: Newcomers are advised to start with videos 00451 &ldquo;An Investment Lecture for Value Investors,&rdquo; 00398, 399, 400, 401, etc., and understand them in the context of the current market. The main recommendation is the Nasdaq 100 index fund (like QQQ), combined with cash or short-term treasury bonds. Relevant handouts and links will be provided on the Clubhouse message board and in the pinned comment on YouTube.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: I&rsquo;ve watched every episode this year and find that the Clubhouse platform has the most comprehensive information and links. YouTube Music is also a good experience, but finding consecutive episodes on YouTube can be a bit inconvenient. I hope there could be a central place for all handouts and links shared by the teacher.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: The YouTube channel has playlists, such as the &ldquo;Weekly ClubHouse&rdquo; series which already has 39 entries and can be played in order. There is also a playlist for short videos with 595 clips. Using playlists makes it easy to listen continuously.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 1: In the smart rebalancing model you mentioned, during an uptrend, 30% of the profits from QLD are moved to SGOV, and during a downtrend, 2% of SGOV is moved to QLD. Is this 2% related to the previously mentioned &ldquo;using 2% of your assets annually for living expenses&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: In smart rebalancing, during an up year, you move 30% of that year&rsquo;s appreciation from the leveraged fund (like QLD) into cash (like SGOV). In a down year, you move 2% of your total assets (equivalent to a portion of living expenses or a planned investment amount) from cash into the leveraged fund. For retirees, the core principle is to ensure your cash reserve can last at least 15 years, because after a market peak, it might take up to 15 years for a non-leveraged fund (QQQ) to have a high probability of doubling. For example, if you start with 50% cash and 50% QQQ, and the market falls for several years while you rebalance, you must ensure the remaining cash can still cover living expenses for (15 years - years passed). A strategy of 70% QQQ + 30% cash, without touching the cash for 15 years, is another option. The key is the &ldquo;15-year cash buffer.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: The total assets of the U.S. are about $200 trillion (200T), with the stock market being about $50T. What comprises the other $150T? Is there an index to track the flow of funds between the stock market and cash?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The remaining assets include real estate, mineral resources, various physical assets, etc. There is currently no specific public index tracking this kind of macro fund flow. The total assets of the U.S. are enormous and grow substantially each year (e.g., by $20-30T). Its debt (about $36T) is not a major issue relative to its total assets and annual growth, so the public shouldn&rsquo;t worry too much. In comparison, an individual investor&rsquo;s balance sheet risk might be higher. As for the claim that Social Security is going bankrupt, I&rsquo;ve been hearing that for 40 years. There&rsquo;s no need to worry; the U.S. can solve it. The Social Security fund itself is more like a pay-as-you-go system, where contributions from new workers pay for retirees&rsquo; benefits, rather than a massive investment fund.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: I am an investor from mainland China and also a Christian. Last year, I sold a primary residence and invested the funds. I feel like a steward of money with a responsibility to manage it well. I originally planned to dollar-cost average into USD and have opened an account in Hong Kong. After listening to your classes recently, I&rsquo;ve been deeply moved by your selfless dedication and strongly agree with your investment philosophy. My current plan is to use my wife&rsquo;s and my annual $50,000 foreign exchange quotas to transfer funds to Longbridge Securities and gradually buy assets like QQQ. I&rsquo;ve also bought some 513100 in the domestic A-share market. Our total capital is about 3 million RMB. I plan to deploy most of it in Longbridge Securities within six months, keeping a small portion domestically. Is this a reasonable approach? I considered using HSBC for pledging, but the threshold is high (over 1 million HKD), transferring from Longbridge to HSBC has fees, and HSBC&rsquo;s management fees might be high. I plan to wait until I have enough capital to transfer it to HSBC all at once.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Your approach is reasonable. You can first accumulate assets in Longbridge Securities and then transfer them in one go when your capital reaches HSBC&rsquo;s pledging threshold or when you are ready to pledge. This is more economical. Investors in mainland China generally lack financial literacy; many get hurt after entering the market blindly and then stay away, including Kevin&rsquo;s own wife who suffered losses in the stock market in 2015 due to the wrong philosophy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing 2: I deeply resonate with your sharing on both the &ldquo;technique&rdquo; (术) of investing and the &ldquo;way&rdquo; (道) of life. I also listen to Pastor Stephen Tong&rsquo;s sermons and have many reflections. Thank you for your efforts. You&rsquo;ve mentioned Confucius and Zhuangzi; I was wondering if you&rsquo;ve come across Pastor Tong&rsquo;s sharing on these topics?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Thank you for sharing, Kevin. I haven&rsquo;t specifically listened to Pastor Stephen Tong&rsquo;s sharing, but I maintain an open and learning attitude towards various religious and philosophical thoughts (Christianity, Buddhism, etc.). If it&rsquo;s recommended to me, I&rsquo;ll listen, as I believe all great truths are interconnected. The core of investing is this: we own companies (like the 100 companies represented by QQQ), and we shouldn&rsquo;t sell them easily just because of external opinions on their stock prices (Mr. Market&rsquo;s neurotic quotes). Focus on long-term holding and accumulating shares, just like accumulating real estate, but with better liquidity. Investing should be passive and simple. You only need to spend 5 minutes at the end of the year (e.g., Dec 31st or the market open on Jan 2nd or 3rd) to rebalance once. Avoid emotional trading based on short-term market fluctuations, which will only get you into trouble, like being influenced by Mr. Market and becoming a &ldquo;lunatic&rsquo;s lunatic.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Question 1: In your Excel model for maintenance margin calculation, are leveraged funds excluded? Is this also the case in Taiwan?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes, in the models of U.S. brokerages, leveraged funds usually cannot be used to calculate maintenance margin because they cannot be pledged themselves. If a Taiwanese brokerage allows leveraged funds to be pledged, its risk tolerance would be better, and the calculated maintenance margin might include the leveraged portion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: My investment journey has been: 0056 (high-dividend) -&gt; 0050 (Taiwan 50) -&gt; 00646 (S&amp;P 500 ETF) -&gt; 00662 (Nasdaq 100 ETF). I recently re-listened to one of your earlier sessions (possibly 00451 or another early one) where you mentioned that if one doesn&rsquo;t have enough money, they could buy 0056 and live off the 4% annual dividend for retirement. Did I misunderstand? It feels like I&rsquo;ve come full circle.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You didn&rsquo;t mishear. Different strategies apply to different life stages and asset sizes. If you are still relatively young, you can use a 433 (QQQ non-leveraged, QLD leveraged, cash) allocation for aggressive growth. If you are close to retirement and your assets are not enough to support a 2% annual withdrawal (i.e., total assets 50 times your annual expenses)—for example, you need 1 million per year but have less than 50 million, maybe only 30 million—then a less volatile option like 00646 (S&amp;P 500) with a 3% annual withdrawal might be a choice. If your assets are even smaller (e.g., only 20 or 25 million), then a high-dividend ETF like 0056, withdrawing the 4% dividend to supplement your living expenses, is a reluctant but realistic option. The 0056 plan is for special cases of insufficient assets; the mainstream, ideal allocation is still centered around QQQ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: If I am about to retire and the market happens to be in a major downturn, at a low point in the model, how should I reposition my assets and plan my living expense withdrawals?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You should base your 2% annual living expense calculation on the total asset value at the market&rsquo;s peak before your retirement. For example, if you had 50 million at the peak and planned to spend 1 million a year. Even if the market then drops for three years and your assets shrink to 25 million, you should still try to maintain your 1 million annual living standard (if your cash reserves allow). Because the market has already been down for several years, the risk is actually lower. You&rsquo;ve passed a three-year window, and you should trust that the market will recover in the coming cycle (15 years minus the years passed).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 4: I am a Taiwanese investor and I buy 00662 with TWD. If the TWD appreciates significantly in the future, will my assets shrink as a result?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: In the long run (e.g., 20, 30, or even over 40 years), the impact of currency fluctuations tends to approach zero. For instance, the TWD/USD exchange rate has historically fluctuated between 25 and 33. Your buying and selling (or spending) is a continuous process, not a single point in time. So, don&rsquo;t worry too much about currency issues; it&rsquo;s not within our consideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 5: There&rsquo;s a U.S. law (the student mentioned &ldquo;Law 899,&rdquo; possibly referring to FATCA or another tax law for foreigners), will it affect us Taiwanese investors?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: That (usually referring to FATCA, etc.) has little to do with Taiwanese people, so don&rsquo;t worry. It mainly targets countries with unequal tax treaties or reciprocal relationships with the U.S., like some G7 countries in Europe (Germany, France, UK, etc.).</li>

I recall reading the book &ldquo;I Might Be Wrong&rdquo; (the author is Swedish) and noted down two points: 1. Secular success doesn&rsquo;t necessarily bring happiness. 2. Focusing on your breath can train your brain. I didn&rsquo;t quite understand it back then.</li>
<li>Question 1: With your rich experience and having reached your current level, what do you think ultimate happiness is? Also, there are many methods for practicing breathing now (like in yoga); do you have any specific experience with learning to breathe?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ul>
<li><strong>Breathing</strong>: It&rsquo;s very simple, just &ldquo;observe your breath&rdquo; (观呼吸). Notice your own inhales and exhales, know that you are breathing. This is observing the breath. Doing so will naturally clear your mind, eliminate distracting thoughts, and enter a state of &ldquo;presence,&rdquo; a relaxed state focused on the now. We often forget we are breathing during the day, which means we are in a tense state.</li>
<li><strong>Happiness</strong>: Happiness is not determined by secular success or external evaluation. The value of a stock has nothing to do with me. The only thing to focus on is yourself. True happiness comes from within. Practice methods: 1. Observe your breath. 2. Practice introspection (similar to meditation or Christian prayer), empty your mind. 3. Relax your entire body (from head to toe), you can lie down, sit in a chair, or sit cross-legged. 4. Enter a hypnotic state (possible after long practice). 5. In the hypnotic state, give yourself positive affirmations (Re-programming), for example, tell yourself &ldquo;I am happy, I am happy, I am happy,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am wealthy, I am wealthy, I am wealthy,&rdquo; &ldquo;All the money in the world is mine, all the money in the world is mine, all the money in the world is mine,&rdquo; &ldquo;All the market&rsquo;s money is mine,&rdquo; &ldquo;My stocks will always go up, up, up, up, only up and never down.&rdquo; Curve your lips upwards, practice smiling. Happiness needs practice. This is the basic skill of hypnotherapy. I recommend the &ldquo;Rachel&rsquo;s Hypnosis Channel&rdquo; on YouTube, which has many guided sessions for different needs (like improving sleep, increasing wealth, relaxation).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: I previously had some money in Firstrade (about 4 million TWD, 5-6% of my total assets). Recently, I&rsquo;ve heard some concerns about overseas brokerages and plan to wire this money back to Taiwan. My current asset allocation is 433. After this money comes back, should I directly convert it to TWD and buy 00670L (Taiwan&rsquo;s Nasdaq leveraged ETF), or should I use this &ldquo;small amount of money&rdquo; to invest in QLD (since the amount is not large, it won&rsquo;t exceed the 7.5 million TWD tax exemption for overseas income by much)? I want to slightly adjust my overall allocation from 433 to 424.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: As long as your total cash reserve remains above 30%, the market value of your leveraged fund does not exceed your non-leveraged fund or your cash position, and the overall Beta of your portfolio does not exceed 1.0, you can proceed as you wish.</li>

<li>Sharing: I always wanted to be a &ldquo;big shot&rdquo; (senior manager), so I left a large company for a VP role at a small Singaporean firm. My salary doubled, but my workload also doubled. I was basically working 7 days a week, 18 hours a day, with no personal time, not even on Sundays or evenings. What was worse, in my third or fourth week, during a meeting with the company&rsquo;s CTO, he was extremely rude (saying things like &ldquo;a one-year-old child could have made your presentation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;what did I hire you for?&rdquo;). I was very upset and felt verbally abused. Then I remembered your words and realized it wasn&rsquo;t worth it. I contacted my former boss at the big company (who said, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say you were going on leave?&rdquo;), and he welcomed me back. I quickly resigned and returned to my old company. Although I&rsquo;m not a &ldquo;big shot,&rdquo; I feel it was the right decision. That one month at the small company was miserable; there was no happiness. It seems more money can&rsquo;t buy happiness.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Brian, you did the absolutely right thing! Cutting your losses in time and leaving an unsuitable environment is crucial. Just as we shouldn&rsquo;t buy or sell based on stock price fluctuations, we shouldn&rsquo;t choose or leave a job solely based on salary. Happiness is priceless, &ldquo;worth a thousand pieces of gold,&rdquo; and far more important than a high salary. When considering a job, the first question to ask is &ldquo;Am I happy?&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re not, you should leave. Happiness is a human right. You shouldn&rsquo;t accept anything that makes you unhappy. First, remove external sources of unhappiness, then cultivate inner happiness. Young people should try to work for large companies. They have more resources, better systems, and you can learn more (learn systems, management, learn in a big ocean), and the career paths are broader. If you encounter a bad manager or department in a large company, consider an internal transfer (the manager might be transferred, but a good company will remain), rather than resigning hastily. I myself proactively sought an opportunity to be transferred from Acer Taiwan to the US.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: I am an old student who started following you during the market low in 2002, and you gave me a lot of confidence back then. Recently, there&rsquo;s a trend in our group to share that if you use a large amount of cash from your pledged loan, you should prepare twice the borrowed amount in cash as a buffer. To meet this requirement, I sold some of my QLD to supplement my cash, which brought my Beta down very low. Now, I have a new sum of money coming in. Should I use it to pay back part of the loan, or to buy back the QLD I sold? Cheng Feng&rsquo;s advice was that if you use a large sum of money, you need to adjust the entire portfolio proportionally, including the non-leveraged fund (QQQ). Does this conflict with your frequent advice to &ldquo;never sell the core fund&rdquo;? Also, I think Kate said that new funds coming in shouldn&rsquo;t be used to return to a fixed ratio allocation? I&rsquo;m very confused and feel like I haven&rsquo;t grasped the core idea after following you for so long.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Cheng Feng&rsquo;s understanding is correct. When you &ldquo;borrow and spend&rdquo; a large amount of cash from your pledged account (e.g., 10% or more of your total assets, like borrowing 1 million from a 10 million total asset base), this is a special situation that requires a &ldquo;re-navigation&rdquo; or &ldquo;re-positioning&rdquo; of your entire asset allocation.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example and Adjustment Steps</strong>: Let&rsquo;s say you originally had 10 million in assets with a 433 allocation: 4 million in QQQ, 3 million in QLD, and 3 million in cash. Now, you need to borrow and spend 1 million for an emergency.
<ol>
<li>For this 1 million loan, you need to set aside an additional 2 million in cash as a risk buffer (because you borrowed 1 million, you prepare 2 million in cash).</li>
<li>So, out of your 10 million total assets, 2 million in cash is specifically designated to cover this loan risk. The remaining 8 million (10 million - 2 million) is then allocated according to your target allocation (e.g., 433, or adjusted to a more conservative Beta of 0.8, which corresponds to a certain proportion). Specifically, a 433 allocation for 8 million would be: 3.2M QQQ, 2.4M QLD, 2.4M operational cash. Add the 2M risk buffer, and your total cash is 4.4M. In this case, the leveraged fund is 2.4M, which is 24% of the 10M total assets, contributing a Beta of 0.48; the non-leveraged fund is 3.2M, contributing a Beta of 0.32. The total Beta is 0.8.</li>
<li>In this situation, selling a portion of your existing QQQ and QLD proportionally and combining it with your existing cash to create the 2 million risk buffer and the cash needed for the new allocation is a reasonable &ldquo;asset structure adjustment.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not considered a &ldquo;sale that violates the never-sell principle.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>New Capital Injection</strong>: When you have new funds coming in (like the new capital you mentioned), you can use them to restore your QLD position or to supplement the relevant parts of your &ldquo;re-navigated&rdquo; target allocation (which might be Beta 0.8). Restoring QLD to bring the Beta back to 0.8 is fine; it doesn&rsquo;t have to go back to 1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Kate&rsquo;s Viewpoint</strong>: What Kate said about &ldquo;new funds not being used to return to a fixed ratio&rdquo; usually refers to routine, small-scale additions of capital. In that case, you don&rsquo;t need to strictly follow the initial 433 ratio; you can flexibly add to the part you feel needs strengthening the most (e.g., add to cash if it&rsquo;s low, or add to the leveraged position if you want to increase it). This is a different scenario from the &ldquo;re-allocation&rdquo; after a &ldquo;large withdrawal and spending&rdquo; that you described. When a plane is on autopilot, small adjustments are fine. But if the number of passengers changes significantly or the destination changes, you need to re-plan the route and fuel.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Under normal autopilot (small fund inflows/outflows or rebalancing due to market fluctuations), the core asset is not easily touched. But when a major event like a large withdrawal for spending occurs, changing the overall risk structure, you need to re-evaluate and adjust the entire allocation. Following for a long time doesn&rsquo;t guarantee you&rsquo;ve learned well; the key is to learn the core principles.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: I want to share some risk points about the direct selling (or MLM) industry, as I heard a user mention wanting to return to Taiwan to do direct selling to change their situation.
<ol>
<li><strong>High entry fees</strong>: Be wary of these.</li>
<li><strong>No substantial product or service</strong>: Or the price of the product/service is severely disconnected from its market value (e.g., selling wine from Maotai Town at an exorbitant price; something worth a few hundred sold for thousands).</li>
<li><strong>Focus on recruiting downlines, ignoring consumer experience</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Different purchase prices for agents at different levels</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Promises of quick riches through IPOs, dividends, or stock options</strong>: Especially with newly established companies that lure you into buying a lot of inventory at once.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Advice for Choosing Direct Selling</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Mainland China</strong>: Look for companies with a direct selling license issued by the Ministry of Commerce (a total of 88), which are relatively legitimate. There are now many new retail, social e-commerce, and micro-business models whose underlying logic may be similar.</li>
<li><strong>US or other regions</strong>: Choose companies that have been established for over 10 years, preferably publicly listed ones (financial reports are public and transparent, and can be analyzed). Only about 10% of new companies survive for three to five years; most fail within five years.</li>
<li><strong>Long-termism</strong>: Even with legitimate direct selling, it requires long-term commitment (at least 5 years). Don&rsquo;t expect to get rich quick. If it feels like a &ldquo;great opportunity&rdquo; for rapid change, there&rsquo;s a high risk of being scammed.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of &ldquo;Direct Selling + Insurance&rdquo; models</strong>: In the US, services can also be sold via direct selling. The combination of direct selling and insurance requires special caution, as it can be highly deceptive, seeming to offer both income and security. Chinese direct selling law requires physical products and a factory.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: JASON&rsquo;s reminder is excellent; scams are everywhere. Everyone should be wary of messages that demand urgent action (e.g., &ldquo;Your payment of $698 has been successful, please call this number if you have questions&rdquo;), or else your account will be frozen, your package will be lost, or that urge you to pay first. You can use AI tools like ChatGPT to make a preliminary judgment on the authenticity of an email (I once used ChatGPT to verify a DMV email). Remember, nothing is that urgent. Take a deep breath, think calmly, and don&rsquo;t part with your money easily. When people are eager to do something (like get rich), they are more likely to be scammed. I myself had an experience in high school with a summer job scam that cost me 300 TWD; I paid the fee and the person disappeared.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The market is truly unrelated to international situations, financial reports, or the economy. Whether interest rates are cut or not doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s all fine, it has nothing to do with us. It all has nothing to do with me.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This viewpoint, woven throughout the session, emphasizes the transcendent mindset an investor should have, focusing on their own investment discipline and not being distracted by external noise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The market will definitely go up, the market will definitely reach new highs. Investing requires patience, and wealth is worth the trouble.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This articulates a firm belief in the long-term trend of the market and the character required for successful investing—patience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I might be wrong. I might be wrong. I might be wrong.
&ndash; Teacher James (quoting from the book &ldquo;I Might Be Wrong&rdquo;)</p></blockquote>
<p>When facing disagreements or strong emotions, engaging in self-reflection first can help resolve conflicts and enhance cognition and inner peace.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hold stocks in your hand, but not their prices in your heart. You only need to spend five minutes a year on it.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This describes the ideal state of investing: holding quality assets without being disturbed by short-term price fluctuations, emphasizing the simplicity and passive nature of investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boredom is the highest state of investing. If you feel it&rsquo;s exciting, then you&rsquo;re speculating, you&rsquo;re gambling.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This reveals the true nature of long-term value investing, drawing a clear line between it and the thrill-seeking behavior of speculation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can handle something, face it and get it done. If you can&rsquo;t handle it, then forget about it, as it&rsquo;s not within your capability.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This offers a philosophical attitude for dealing with various problems in life and investing, reducing unnecessary worries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely do not sell your QQQ, sell your 00662, during a downturn. You can choose not to buy, but you must never sell.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This emphasizes that one should not panic-sell core quality assets during a market correction, a common mistake among investors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t leave (your current job) because your salary is low, and don&rsquo;t jump to another just because its salary is high.
&ndash; Teacher James (commenting on Brian&rsquo;s sharing)</p></blockquote>
<p>This highlights that in career choices, personal happiness and the growth environment are more important than short-term salary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your cash must be able to last you 15 years (during a market downturn). This is a critical key.
&ndash; Teacher James (on asset allocation for retirees)</p></blockquote>
<p>This points out the importance of having cash reserves in retirement planning that can cover a long bear market (which could last up to 15 years before the market doubles).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happiness is a human right. Therefore, you shouldn&rsquo;t accept anything that makes you unhappy.
&ndash; Teacher James (commenting on Brian&rsquo;s sharing)</p></blockquote>
<p>This encourages people to prioritize inner happiness and harmony in their work and life, and to have the courage to change unhappy situations.</p>

<p>In this sharing session, Teacher James once again reinforced the core philosophy of long-term investing: maintain optimism, adhere to discipline, and filter out market noise with the wisdom of &ldquo;it has nothing to do with me.&rdquo; By recommending &ldquo;I Might Be Wrong&rdquo; and &ldquo;Life is Worthwhile,&rdquo; he guided students to cultivate their inner selves, focus on breathing and relaxation, and achieve harmony in both investing and life. In terms of asset allocation, the teacher detailed cash management strategies for different life stages, especially the importance of having 15 years of living expenses for retirees to safely navigate market cycles, and gave clear guidance on pledging, leverage, and Beta control. The Q&amp;A session delved into specific cases, addressing students&rsquo; confusion in practical operations, such as portfolio adjustments after large cash withdrawals, tax considerations for overseas investments, the wisdom of career choices, and preventing financial scams like direct selling. The teacher encouraged students to work and live in a relaxed, stress-free state, to simplify investing, and ultimately achieve financial freedom and life happiness. He emphasized investing in index funds like QQQ/00662 and avoiding annuities and unnecessary insurance.</p>

<li><strong>Stablecoins and Short-Term Treasuries</strong>: A student asked if the issuance of stablecoins would increase demand for short-term treasuries and lower their interest rates. Teacher James believes short-term treasury rates are tied to the central bank&rsquo;s rates and won&rsquo;t fall significantly because of this. Short-term treasuries are similar to money market funds with low volatility. The central bank&rsquo;s rate is the benchmark; no one would buy a bond with a lower rate.</li>
<li><strong>The Trap of Long-Term Bonds</strong>: Long-term bond interest is linked to inflation expectations for many years to come, and the interest is fixed.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: For a 30-year Treasury bond with a 5% coupon rate, if inflation is 3%, the real annualized rate of return (Real IRR) is only 1.94%. In contrast, if short-term rates are 4%, it is far superior to the real return of long-term bonds. The $5 in interest you receive after 30 years will have long been devalued.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: It is not recommended for individual investors to buy long-term government bonds. Issuing long-term bonds is advantageous for the U.S. Treasury because the long-term interest is close to zero for the issuer (after considering inflation). Even if the central bank&rsquo;s rate is below 2%, buying long-term bonds is not necessarily a good deal. The Treasury has its own issuance plan and won&rsquo;t easily change it due to shifts in the central bank&rsquo;s rates. The idea of issuing 100-year bonds is impractical and tantamount to default.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Awareness</strong>: The first priority in investing is risk control; the world is full of uncertainties (like the conflict in Israel).</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Asset Allocation</strong>: Good asset allocation is a &ldquo;master strategy&rdquo; (奇门遁甲), a powerful &ldquo;Army, Navy, and Air Force&rdquo; deployment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash</strong>: The &ldquo;food and air&rdquo; of asset allocation, the most important part. Sufficient cash prevents market panic.</li>
<li><strong>Index Fund</strong>: The &ldquo;aircraft carrier&rdquo; of asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraged Fund</strong>: Like the &ldquo;missile force.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging</strong>: The &ldquo;Transformer&rdquo; of asset allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Courage to Sell a House for Investment</strong>: Selling your primary residence to rent and investing the funds in an index is an excellent financial strategy, but it requires a strong mind and the courage to face social judgment (e.g., fear of being told you&rsquo;re &ldquo;not doing well&rdquo;). In reality, this is a sign of &ldquo;doing exceptionally well.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Difficulty of Educating Family and Friends</strong>: Family and friends would rather trust the annuities and savings insurance (1% return) recommended by bank advisors than accept advice about index funds (10% long-term return), even when presented with spreadsheets. The main reason is the fear of &ldquo;what if it drops?&rdquo;
<ul>
<li><strong>Counter-strategy</strong>: First, become a &ldquo;big tree&rdquo; yourself and influence them with your own success. Your words carry little weight when you&rsquo;re insignificant; &ldquo;familiarity breeds contempt&rdquo; (近庙欺神). It&rsquo;s hard to distinguish &ldquo;saints&rdquo; from &ldquo;demons&rdquo; in society.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive Roots of the Wealth Gap</strong>: Poverty is often caused by a lack of awareness, not systemic issues. CLEC aims to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; this &ldquo;disease of poverty,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s very difficult; even family members may not accept it. Some people can&rsquo;t accept good medicine and instead buy things like long-term bonds.</li>
<li><strong>The Challenges of Individual Stock Investing</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: NVIDIA&rsquo;s stock price fluctuates wildly. It was once sold off due to poor sales and excess inventory, then soared because of AI. It&rsquo;s difficult for individual investors to grasp; even if you bought it, you might not have held on for the entire ride.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Individual stocks are volatile, information is asymmetric, and they can suddenly be cut in half or go to zero. ETFs provide a more stable way to share in market growth. It&rsquo;s also very hard to stick with a portfolio of mixed-quality individual stocks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Dangers of Short-Term Trading</strong>: Short-term trading is like &ldquo;gambling + drug addiction.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s addictive and leads not only to financial loss but also the loss of family, health, and self, potentially ruining one&rsquo;s entire life. There&rsquo;s no need to become a &ldquo;boy wonder trader.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Profit Motives of Banks and Insurance Companies</strong>: Criticizes post offices and banks for persuading depositors (especially the elderly) to buy annuity insurance, structured notes, and similar products. This is a failure of financial regulators.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Issues</strong>: Believes financial regulators should ensure the separation of savings, insurance, wealth management, and lending to avoid conflicts of interest. American commercial banks (like BofA) don&rsquo;t proactively sell insurance. Taiwan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Financial Holding Company&rdquo; model is described as an &ldquo;all-encompassing, one-stop-shop scam.&rdquo; Charles Schwab only mentions loan options when a client has a large funding need.</li>
<li><strong>The Goal of the Insurance Industry</strong>: To convert large amounts of fixed deposits into insurance policies, which is the main objective of the insurance industry, given the huge amount of fixed deposits in Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>The Risk of Mortgaging Property to Buy Insurance</strong>: There have been cases where the property mortgage remains, but the insurance policy&rsquo;s value drops to zero, leaving people homeless. These institutions &ldquo;will go as far as making people homeless.&rdquo;</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>On Publishing a Book/Media Exposure</strong>: Teacher James frankly states that if he were to publicly promote his ideas like &ldquo;investing with loans&rdquo; and &ldquo;not buying a house,&rdquo; he could violate financial regulations (practicing without a license), offend powerful interest groups (real estate, insurance, finance), and even face cyberbullying and political pressure (being labeled &ldquo;pro-Taiwan independence&rdquo; or &ldquo;pro-CCP&rdquo;). He could be &ldquo;torn to shreds&rdquo; or even &ldquo;end up in jail.&rdquo; If he doesn&rsquo;t discuss many of these topics, the teaching loses its meaning. The very people you help might turn around and curse you.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance</strong>: An insurance policy with a 1.06% annual return is acceptable if it includes protection, but it&rsquo;s generally not recommended.</li>
<li><strong>Caring for Parents</strong>: Re-emphasizes the loneliness and health risks of elderly people living alone (not taking medicine on time, not measuring blood sugar/pressure, leading to complications like worsening COPD, minor strokes, brain atrophy, mental disorders). Advises children to pay attention and provide companionship early. Even if parents seem self-sufficient, consider arranging for a caregiver early to prevent accidents and ensure a regular routine (medication, diet, avoiding falls). Shares his regret of not returning to Taiwan in time to accompany his mother, who, despite having other children in Taiwan, was not adequately cared for while living alone. Emphasizes that parents&rsquo; health is the children&rsquo;s happiness.</li>
<li><strong>A Partner&rsquo;s Investment Philosophy</strong>: Accept individual differences. Due to different upbringings and personal experiences (like living through the dot-com and 2008 bubbles), security levels and cognitions vary. Lead by example and influence them gradually with long-term results; don&rsquo;t force it. It&rsquo;s normal for them not to listen to you, just as you may not listen to them.</li>
<li><strong>00662 (Taiwan ETF) Currency Impact</strong>: Short-term currency fluctuations are normal. For instance, when the Taiwan dollar depreciated in the previous two years, 00662 outperformed QQQ. In the long run, currency effects tend to cancel each other out.</li>
<li><strong>Credit Loans vs. Stock Pledges</strong>: Credit loans are relatively independent and safe. Stock pledges are high-risk; a sharp market downturn could trigger a margin call, making it like a &ldquo;loan shark&rdquo; — you have to pay back when they demand it, or you&rsquo;re &ldquo;shot dead with one bullet.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Brokerage Firms Raising Pledge Rates and Risks</strong>: Brokerages like Capital Securities in Taiwan might raise interest rates after a client has borrowed, or even restrict withdrawals (due to limited funding pools), &ldquo;luring you into a trap.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s advisable to prioritize more stable brokerages like Yuanta Securities.</li>
<li><strong>Apply for Credit Loans Early</strong>: Bank credit policies can change. When you qualify (e.g., with an interest rate below 2%), you should apply early. Seize the opportunity when a bank proactively offers you a loan.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging in Hong Kong</strong>: HSBC is a good choice, especially for VIP clients with large capital (e.g., over 1 million HKD). HSBC&rsquo;s pledge interest rates are currently low. Friends from Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, etc., who successfully open an account and get a pledge loan from HSBC are welcome to share their experiences.</li>
<li><strong>QQQ Compounding</strong>: The annualized rate of return (CAGR), according to Teacher James&rsquo;s research, is around 18% (including dividend reinvestment).</li>
<li><strong>Repayment of Investment Mortgage</strong>: Typically, it&rsquo;s a lump-sum repayment at maturity (10-15 years). By then, you can sell some stocks or use another pledged loan to repay it. You need more than 15 years to ensure profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Compound Frequency</strong>: Refers to capital gains and dividend reinvestment.</li>
<li><strong>Philosophy of Helping Others</strong>: There are different levels of helping others. The lowest is for others (hoping for their well-being). The next is for oneself (deriving happiness or meaning from it). The highest is selflessness (helping is a natural act, regardless of for whom, or whether it brings happiness, like the Buddha or Jesus; it&rsquo;s natural ethics). Using helping others to add meaning and happiness to one&rsquo;s own life is actually &ldquo;not right.&rdquo; The highest state is &ldquo;like water flowing without a trace&rdquo; (传过水无痕).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: An elderly friend, who was once very influential in the market, agrees with Teacher James&rsquo;s index investing philosophy. This elder confessed that his past outsized returns were due to information asymmetry and his influence (manipulating small-cap stocks), which is not replicable for ordinary investors. He believes it&rsquo;s not easy for ordinary people to make money in the market, and index investing is the most correct path.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Index investing not only makes you money but also gives you a &ldquo;life&rdquo; (improves quality of life). Even if you make money from short-term trading, you might lose your life due to constant anxiety (e.g., being unable to take a 15-day vacation with peace of mind).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sharing (Follow-up)</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Reflecting on her family life, she emphasizes love and companionship for her parents to avoid regrets. She sees Teacher James&rsquo;s actions as &ldquo;dedication&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;charity&rdquo; with a sense of superiority and feels for the misunderstandings he might face.</li>
<li>Shares her future plans: to establish a women&rsquo;s financial academy (focusing on female financial awareness, as Chinese women are relatively disadvantaged, and financial independence provides more confidence), volunteer in hospice care (to learn about &ldquo;fasting until death&rdquo; and euthanasia), travel, read, and set up scholarships, reflecting a desire for &ldquo;altruism&rdquo; (influenced by Kazuo Inamori&rsquo;s philosophy of &ldquo;altruism&rdquo;).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Commends Kacy&rsquo;s practice of accompanying her parents. Shares the joy of his own father, in his 90s, still planning a trip to Korea. Advises that for elderly parents, even if they appear healthy, one should consider arranging for a caregiver early to prevent accidents and ensure a regular routine (medication, diet). Parents&rsquo; health is the children&rsquo;s happiness. If parents have medical needs, like follow-up visits every three months or low-dose lung cancer screenings, they should be supported.</li>
<li>Greatly admires Kacy&rsquo;s &ldquo;altruistic&rdquo; plans, believing that from a women&rsquo;s financial academy to educating disadvantaged groups, it&rsquo;s all very meaningful. It&rsquo;s right to start planning now.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: His mother noticed his mood has become calmer and happier recently. He explained it&rsquo;s because through investing (practicing the teacher&rsquo;s teachings), he has found meaning in life and is confident about his future wealth, no longer worrying about finances. This has led to an internal change from external influences.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Shares his own longing and regrets regarding his mother, how in his youth he failed to fully grasp the loneliness and hardship of an elderly person living alone (e.g., his mother falling while going to the doctor alone, and his own failure to return to Taiwan to be with her). Reminds everyone to care for their parents, especially those living alone, after achieving financial freedom early, to avoid life&rsquo;s regrets. Advises young people to learn from wise elders (like Warren Buffett) to avoid many pitfalls and find a &ldquo;mental coach.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Following the teacher&rsquo;s guidance, he used an investment mortgage to invest in 00662. After using a portion of the funds from high-dividend ETFs to pay the monthly interest, there&rsquo;s still a surplus each month. Should he invest this in 00865 (short-term bond/cash-like ETF) or continue buying fractional shares of 00662?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Continue buying 00662. The emergency fund (00865) only needs to be built up to a certain level (e.g., 2-3 years of living expenses for someone employed). Any excess funds should be invested in growth assets.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: Recalls entering the market in 2018, with emotions fluctuating with the market, having once lost 50%. A wise friend enlightened her (&ldquo;Save money when you&rsquo;re making it, and just wait it out when it&rsquo;s down&rdquo;), teaching her to remain calm through ups and downs and become numb to the market. Mentions how wealthy people view money (a piece of clothing costs 500-600k; money is like trash to them). Grateful for the teacher&rsquo;s guidance that has &ldquo;filled her head.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: Has come to understand the teacher&rsquo;s mindset that &ldquo;all sharing is for self-fulfillment, not for rewards.&rdquo; When sharing investment ideas with others, she encounters different reactions: some (who have worked for 20-30 years and are set in their ways) cling to old concepts, while others, despite living in hardship (a single mother working two jobs), are willing to listen. Through sharing, she has also gained a sense of value by giving back the knowledge she has learned.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: (Regarding Sharing 2) Helping others can bring happiness, but the highest state is to be &ldquo;unaffected by helping,&rdquo; meaning helping others is a natural act, not for happiness, not for self. The lowest level is &ldquo;for others,&rdquo; i.e., for their benefit; the second level is &ldquo;for oneself,&rdquo; i.e., achieving self-actualization through helping (the teacher admits his own teaching is to find value in retirement); the highest is &ldquo;selflessness,&rdquo; where even the thought of &ldquo;for myself&rdquo; is gone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: After sharing investment concepts with friends, how can she determine if they truly understand? Are there any questions to ask to test them? (Friends listen and think it&rsquo;s logical but can&rsquo;t articulate it themselves.)
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: It&rsquo;s hard to judge with simple questions. True understanding is reflected in action (like opening an account to invest). A more effective way is like how Frank guided him back in the day (meeting for dinner every week, hand-holding him through opening an account, starting with a $200 Mutual Fund), guiding them step-by-step to open an account, make their first investment, and follow up continuously. This is a process of &ldquo;sowing seeds&rdquo;; whether and when they sprout is unknown. He himself was &ldquo;led by the hand&rdquo; by Frank to get started. Now, he is willing to be such a guide, with the Bodhisattva spirit of &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t descend into hell, who will?&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Gained insights from gardening.
<ol>
<li><strong>Individual Differences</strong>: The same seeds planted result in different flowers, just as people receive information differently. Their internal &ldquo;genes&rdquo; determine their level of acceptance and reaction (some &ldquo;get it,&rdquo; others &ldquo;laugh it off&rdquo;). The gardener (the sharer) cannot change the seed&rsquo;s nature.</li>
<li><strong>Patient Guidance</strong>: A good gardener will loosen the soil and water, helping it grow, just as a mentor guides students to open accounts and invest.</li>
<li><strong>Inner Joy</strong>: The pleasure derived from tilling the soil and weeding surpasses the rewards of all fame and fortune. This effort is not for a return but for self-actualization.</li>
<li><strong>Practical Example</strong>: She once guided a friend to buy QQQ. The friend sold during a dip and missed the subsequent 45% gain. She only sent a screenshot and said no more, believing it was also &ldquo;fate.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Came into contact with CLEC in 2024 through a friend (who had mentioned it 5 years ago, but she was indifferent at the time). In her 50s, she has been interested in investing since graduating from college and has been exploring on her own for years. She was deeply moved after listening to the lectures and has invested a lot of time in studying (finished the 2021-2022 courses and is now re-listening). She shared it with a hundred people, and only two took action, but she still feels gratified.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Regarding the choice between a credit loan and a stock pledge in Taiwan. She leans towards using the stock pledge first (2.56% interest, no principal repayment, only interest), because of its convenience. She thinks she can use a credit loan (already approved for a 3 million TWD limit, but requires installment repayments) as a backup if the stock market crashes. She believes her job is stable (banks are always begging her to take out loans), so she&rsquo;s not afraid of unemployment and can access the credit loan anytime.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: (In a firm tone, repeatedly emphasizing) <strong>Absolutely do not do this!</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: Money borrowed from a stock pledge <strong>must not be reinvested in the stock market</strong>. It can only be used for living expenses or to repay other loans. This is &ldquo;the first thing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Huge Risk</strong>: When the market crashes, banks may tighten credit (&ldquo;take away the umbrella in the rain&rdquo;), and you might not be able to borrow money then. If you lose your job at the same time, it&rsquo;s even more impossible. A credit loan is not something you can just &ldquo;hold there&rdquo; forever.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy All Troops (韩信点兵)</strong>: All available &ldquo;forces&rdquo; (including the credit loan) should be deployed to the &ldquo;battlefield&rdquo; (investment) as early as possible.</li>
<li><strong>The Correct Approach</strong>: You should first take out the credit loan (e.g., 3 million TWD) and invest it in the market. The monthly loan repayments can be paid using funds from a low-interest stock pledge. This way, the principal continues to work in the market, and your personal salary can also be invested. Don&rsquo;t take a huge risk just because you&rsquo;re &ldquo;too lazy to repay the principal&rdquo; or tempted by the short-term convenience of a pledge.</li>
<li><strong>Safety of Credit Loans</strong>: A credit loan is a relatively safe form of leverage, not directly linked to market fluctuations, and you won&rsquo;t get a margin call. With a stock pledge, even if you only borrow 10% (e.g., pledging 1 million from a 10 million asset portfolio—the teacher thinks 10% is already a huge risk, let alone the 2-3 million she wants to borrow), you could face risks in an extreme market downturn.</li>
<li><strong>Brokerage Risk</strong>: Some brokerages in Taiwan (like Capital Securities) may change their pledge interest rates, and their limited funding pools might prevent you from withdrawing funds as needed.
(Kacy and other students also chimed in, emphasizing the risk of banks &ldquo;taking away the umbrella in the rain&rdquo; and the fundamental difference between credit loans and pledges, and that pledged money cannot be used to buy more stocks).</li>

<p>Background: A stern warning about the immense dangers of short-term trading, comparing it to gambling and drug addiction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In investing, we first seek safety, then profit. First, seek safety; do what is foolproof first.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Emphasizing that the primary principle of investing is safety, in response to a student&rsquo;s question about credit loans versus stock pledges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are making money, you should also be humble and look at everything with humility. Just as Teacher James taught me, whether the market goes up or down, OK, be numb to it. It doesn&rsquo;t have a big impact on our daily lives.
&ndash; IM</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student IM sharing her transformation from anxiously watching the market to maintaining a calm composure towards market fluctuations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The things we invest in others, when we invest, it&rsquo;s not for a return. It&rsquo;s because you have to do this thing. You have to do what is meaningful to you; this is the value of your being.
&ndash; Man</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Man drawing an analogy from gardening to the intrinsic value of sharing knowledge and helping others, without seeking external rewards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life is really not just about money&hellip; Wealth is about having enough.
&ndash; Kacy</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Kacy sharing her pursuit of quality of life, believing that more wealth is not necessarily better; having enough is sufficient.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The highest level is helping others without any sense of happiness, without feeling&hellip; Even the &lsquo;for myself&rsquo; is gone. This is what I have learned, that even the &lsquo;for myself&rsquo; is gone.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When responding to IM&rsquo;s question about the motivation for sharing, he explains the three levels of helping behavior, the highest of which is selfless altruism, a natural act.</p>

<p>In this session, Teacher James systematically re-emphasized his core investment philosophy: consistently buy and hold the Nasdaq 100 index fund, fearless of short-term market volatility. He focused on analyzing the extreme importance of risk control, viewing reasonable asset allocation (especially an adequate cash reserve) as the cornerstone of investment success. Through specific examples, the teacher revealed the investment value trap of long-term bonds and severely criticized certain misleading and detrimental practices in the financial industry, especially warning investors against low-return products like annuities and savings insurance. At the same time, he pointed out the huge uncertainty of individual stock investing and the destructive nature of short-term trading. During the Q&amp;A session, students actively shared their insights and confusions from their investment practices, family communication, and personal growth. Teacher James not only provided specific investment advice (such as the correct use and risk perception of credit loans versus stock pledges) but also guided students from a life philosophy perspective to reflect on the meaning of wealth, work, family, and personal value, encouraging everyone on the path to financial freedom to continuously enhance their cognition, maintain a positive mindset, pay attention to family and social responsibilities, and ultimately give back to society.</p>

<p>This session revolves around the optimistic outlook for the investment market, driven by advancements in high-tech development and corporate profitability. The core viewpoint is that investors should remain extremely optimistic, invest long-term in funds like the Nasdaq-100 Index Fund (QQQ), and implement a reasonable asset allocation based on their personal circumstances to achieve wealth growth and inner peace. Additionally, it delves into the connection between life philosophy and investment mentality, as well as the potential impact of emerging financial tools like stablecoins.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Solid Returns with Beta 0.5</strong>: Even with just 50% in QQQ (Beta 0.5) and 50% in cash (e.g., a money market fund with a hypothetical 4% return), the long-term annualized return can be substantial (e.g., 0.5 * 4% + 0.5 * 14% = 9%).</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation for Retirees</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Retirees with sufficient funds should prioritize stability over maximum returns.</li>
<li>Suggested allocations: 70% QQQ + 30% cash; 60% QQQ + 40% cash; or 50% QQQ + 50% cash.</li>
<li>Keep at least 30% in cash as a stabilizing force.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rebalancing Considerations</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If you have sufficient cash flow and reserves, there&rsquo;s no need to actively rebalance. Let QQQ grow through compounding.</li>
<li>If reserves are insufficient, sell a portion of QQQ when it has significant gains to increase your cash reserves.</li>
<li>Retirees can set aside 15 years of living expenses in cash and invest the rest in QQQ. When the cash is used up, withdraw half of the QQQ holdings into cash, and repeat the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation for Young People</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Set aside a 1-2 year emergency fund and prepare for children&rsquo;s tuition.</li>
<li>The remaining funds can be fully invested in QQQ.</li>
<li>Start conservatively when first entering the market and gradually increase your risk tolerance.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Life is hard enough without feelings; feelings make life even harder&rdquo;</strong>: Replace &ldquo;feelings&rdquo; (情) with &ldquo;human nature&rdquo; (人性), and the saying becomes: &ldquo;Human nature makes the stock market even harder.&rdquo; To succeed in investing, you must train yourself to overcome the emotional weaknesses of human nature, achieving a state of &ldquo;indifference to the market and money,&rdquo; feeling nothing about gains or losses.</li>
<li><strong>Separation of Tasks</strong>: Distinguish between your own tasks and others&rsquo; tasks. For example, a child&rsquo;s education is the parents&rsquo; task and should not be overly interfered with by grandparents.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correct Mistakes Promptly</strong>: If an initial investment strategy was wrong and led to losses, change it immediately rather than waiting to break even. The latter is a gambler&rsquo;s mentality.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Direction</strong>: Effort is meaningful only when the direction is correct. The right direction is proper asset allocation, index investing, and maintaining sufficient cash.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Awareness and Control</strong>: First, understand the risks (e.g., the market could drop 85% and stay there for 10 years). Then, control the risk through asset allocation (cash is a critical line of defense, like the air force and supplies in a battle).</li>
<li><strong>Buying Strategy</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The best option is to buy immediately when you have the money.</li>
<li>If buying in installments, do so at predetermined times and at the market price, regardless of market ups and downs.</li>
<li>&ldquo;He who buys is an apprentice; he who holds on for dear life is the master.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Wisdom of Borrowing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Money is only yours when it&rsquo;s in your pocket.&rdquo;</li>
<li>In low-interest-rate regions (like Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China), borrow money to invest. Use leverage to let &ldquo;other people&rsquo;s chickens lay eggs for you&rdquo; (generate returns with borrowed money) while your own &ldquo;chickens&rdquo; (assets) continue to grow.</li>
<li>Social security benefits and the like should be claimed as early as possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Individualized Advice</strong>: Teacher James emphasizes that his investment advice is a &ldquo;unique&rdquo; prescription for each person, tailored to their individual circumstances. There is no one-size-fits-all &ldquo;standard answer.&rdquo; For example, buying immediately at market price is ideal but not suitable for those with low psychological tolerance. A Beta of 1.0 or a 442 strategy (40% cash, 40% index, 20% leveraged index) offers high returns but also high risk. A Beta above 0.5 is enough to become wealthy.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing:
<ol>
<li>Successfully applied for a &ldquo;home equity line of credit&rdquo; in Taiwan with a limit of over NT$10 million, an interest rate of about 2.4%, and an interest-only period of 2 years, extendable once to 4 years. After 4 years, it can be converted to an &ldquo;overdraft account,&rdquo; where you only pay interest (rate around 2.5%) and can use the principal indefinitely.</li>
<li>Plans to start investing next week according to the teacher&rsquo;s 4-3-3 allocation (40% cash, 30% QQQ, 30% leveraged QQQ. Michel&rsquo;s understanding might differ slightly from the teacher&rsquo;s later clarification, which defined 433 as 40% cash, 30% index, 30% leveraged index).</li>
<li>Although he missed the lower entry points, he has come to realize that looking back 20 years from now, today&rsquo;s prices will all seem sweet.</li>
<li>Thanks the teacher for expanding his cognition and giving him the courage to use financial weapons. The bank&rsquo;s review process was strict, so getting the loan means the bank also considers the risk manageable. His wife being an employee of a listed company might have helped. He used to think he should never be in debt, but his perspective has now changed.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: The fact that the bank dared to lend to you means they have assessed the risk. The low interest rates in Taiwan are a great opportunity. The current price of QQQ (e.g., $70-80) makes little difference in the long run (e.g., when it reaches $80,000 in the future). He encourages buying as soon as possible. Investing with borrowed money is a capitalist awakening, not a rebellious act.</li>

<li>Question: The teacher recently discussed technical analysis on other platforms to guide people towards long-term investing. Could he briefly explain the differences, pros, and cons of short-term technical analysis versus long-term investing for new students?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: He respects short-term traders and their philosophies. He used to trade that way himself with good results (but emphasizes it&rsquo;s not for everyone). He compares short-term trading to being a race car driver, with its specific scenarios and risks. Sharing his technical analysis experience is a way to offer them some help or an alternative perspective (long-term investing), not to change them. He is practicing how to communicate with people of different viewpoints, as if talking to his 25-year-old self. He himself does not trade short-term now and does not recommend it to his students. The technical analysis he refers to is very short-term (determining long/short based on a single candlestick). He admires the focus and effort of short-term traders.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: Explained investing to a 14-year-old from a poor family. He used analogies (Is today better than five years ago? Is this generation better off than our parents&rsquo;? Will the future be even better? Farmland evolving from growing bananas to oil palms to durians to solar panels, constantly seeking higher returns) to illustrate that QQQ automatically weeds out the weak and keeps the strong, just like how the &ldquo;fertile field&rdquo; of American high-tech is constantly being optimized. The boy&rsquo;s eyes filled with hope when he saw how 50 Malaysian Ringgit could become tens of millions through decades of compounding. IAM feels that 80-90% of people around him don&rsquo;t understand QQQ and will persist in sharing one-on-one.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: (Mentioned later when answering IAM&rsquo;s question) Being able to plant the seed of wealth for a young person is to save a person, a family. It is a wonderful thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 1: Regarding asset allocation (e.g., 442, 433, 631), after doing his own homework, he found that risk tolerance is closely related to one&rsquo;s personal life situation (work, consumption). He asks the teacher to confirm if asset allocation should be strictly by percentage, or if the proportion of leveraged funds should not exceed the cash or original capital.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Strategies like 433 (40% cash, 30% index fund, 30% leveraged fund) or 442 (40% cash, 40% index, 20% leveraged index) aim to raise the Beta to 1.0 using leverage while maintaining the safety of cash, thereby hoping not to lose out on market returns. This is the highest-risk allocation that passed simulations, like a plane pulling up just after scraping the ground—highly efficient. But it&rsquo;s not the only option; for example, 50% QQQ + 50% cash used as collateral also works. For retirees, it&rsquo;s recommended to keep Beta below 0.8, have at least 30% cash, and the leveraged fund portion should not exceed the cash or original capital—the lower the better, or even none at all. Beta should not be lower than 0.5.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: How exactly does QQQ&rsquo;s mechanism of &ldquo;weeding out the weak&rdquo; work? Is it based on market capitalization comparison or a standard like outperforming the SPY?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: QQQ selects the top 100 non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq, ranked by market capitalization. Market Cap = Stock Price × Shares Outstanding. If a company performs poorly, its stock price falls, and its market cap drops out of the top 100, it gets removed. This has nothing to do with whether the company is profitable (e.g., Amazon and Tesla were included in their early, unprofitable days due to their large market caps). The S&amp;P 500, on the other hand, has other criteria like profitability. QQQ selects the top 100, while SPY selects the top 500; a more elite group (QQQ) will generally have better average performance. The Dow Jones 30 is an even older index construction method.</li>

Why not just invest in fiat currencies, commodities, or the US dollar directly? Can stablecoins appreciate in value? What is their real use? Is there an arbitrage opportunity like the one between TSMC&rsquo;s ADR (TSM) and its Taiwan stock (2330)?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ul>
<li><strong>TSMC Price Difference</strong>: It&rsquo;s normal for the same asset to have different prices in different markets (US ADR vs. local Taiwan stock), just as the same product has different prices in different stores, determined by market supply and demand.</li>
<li><strong>Core Value of Stablecoins</strong>: It mainly lies in <strong>transaction efficiency</strong>. Digital currency transfers are nearly instantaneous and global, whereas cross-border fiat transfers take days.</li>
<li><strong>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC)</strong>: Europe, China, and others are developing CBDCs to improve the circulation efficiency of their own currencies. China is also promoting CIPS to bypass SWIFT.</li>
<li><strong>US Shift in Attitude Towards Stablecoins</strong>: The US initially suppressed digital currencies (e.g., dealing with Binance&rsquo;s CZ, certain crypto-related banks). However, after the Trump administration, it realized that the dollar&rsquo;s status could be challenged by highly efficient digital currencies. It then shifted to embracing and regulating existing private stablecoin issuers (like Circle), bringing them under supervision through measures like the &ldquo;Genius Act&rdquo; (likely a colloquial term for a stablecoin regulation bill) to maintain the dollar&rsquo;s dominance in the digital sphere.</li>
<li><strong>Stablecoins Do Not Appreciate</strong>: Stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) are pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Their reserves consist of equivalent amounts of short-term US Treasury bills and cash. Issuers profit by earning interest on these reserves, while the stablecoins themselves do not pay interest to holders.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Stablecoins</strong>: They are primarily used for rapid payments and settlements, especially in international trade or business-to-business transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Monetary Expansion Effect</strong>: When banks hold Treasuries and issue an equivalent amount of stablecoins, it effectively increases the money supply (the Treasuries still exist, and now stablecoins are also in circulation). This is a positive for the stock market because it increases the liquidity of money and boosts economic efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Us as Investors</strong>: The accelerated flow of money will stimulate the economy, which is good for the stock market. Banks gain a new source of interest income from issuing stablecoins, so bank stocks may benefit.</li>
<li><strong>Regulation and KYC</strong>: To prevent money laundering, etc., the issuance and trading of stablecoins will be strictly regulated, requiring KYC (Know Your Customer) identity verification.</li>

<li>Question: She would like to know about Teacher James&rsquo;s typical day and his favorite news, magazines, or TV shows, in order to better learn his investment philosophy and life principles.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended YouTube Channels</strong>: &ldquo;宏观洞察&rdquo; (Macro-Insight, for mainstream US political and economic views), &ldquo;爱丽的无废话财经&rdquo; (Alice&rsquo;s No-Nonsense Finance, for relatively objective analysis of China&rsquo;s situation), &ldquo;Mr. Edwin财经&rdquo; (Mr. Edwin Finance). He absorbs information, thinks, researches, and connects the dots to form his own knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Daily Life</strong>: Responds to comments and emails, makes short videos, has lunch and a nap, makes fruit and vegetable smoothies, snacks, has dinner, listens to audiobooks at night (prepares for bed at 9 PM), grows tomatoes, cucumbers, and flowers, and walks and dines with his family. His life is plain and simple.</li>
<li><strong>Clarification</strong>: Denies being a &ldquo;Trump fan&rdquo; and does not comment on quarrels between political figures.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Background</strong>: Shared a link to a previous interview (&ldquo;美香&rdquo;) and the YouTube playlist &ldquo;缘起今日&rdquo; (Origins of Today), which contain more about his personal experiences.</li>

<li>Question: Does the teacher use Zi Wei Dou Shu (Purple Star Astrology), metaphysics, or similar methods to look at stocks or investment directions?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: In theory, Zi Wei Dou Shu could be used for stocks, and some friends use the I Ching for divination, but he has never actually used them for investment decisions, only for understanding his personal birth chart. He emphasizes that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with these tools themselves, but if the user is not proficient or has ill intentions (like fortune-tellers who often exaggerate problems to sell solutions), they can be misleading or even harmful. One should not blindly trust them unless one has studied them deeply and knows how to apply them correctly. He has, however, practiced technical analysis in the past.</li>

<li><strong>Binance&rsquo;s Profitability</strong>: Earns in the tens of billions of US dollars per year, which is why banks are eager to enter the stablecoin market.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>This viewpoint emphasizes confidence in the long-term market trend, encouraging investors to ignore short-term fluctuations.</p></blockquote>

<p>In investing, besides wealth, we should also pursue inner peace.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This points to a higher goal of investing: peace of mind.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>This explains a key reason for choosing index funds: to maintain a peaceful life.</p></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Life is hard enough without feelings; feelings make life even harder.&rdquo;&hellip; Human nature makes the stock market even harder. So what to do? Human nature is natural, but how do you train yourself to be devoid of human nature?

<blockquote>
<p>If you listen to something, and after the person has finished speaking, you don&rsquo;t understand what they&rsquo;re talking about, it&rsquo;s probably because they don&rsquo;t understand it, not because you don&rsquo;t.
&ndash; Teacher James (quoting and agreeing with Rosemary&rsquo;s viewpoint)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This offers a method for judging whether an information provider truly understands the content they are presenting.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this session, Teacher James once again emphasized the core strategy of long-term investment in high-quality index funds (like QQQ) and encouraged investors to remain optimistic in the current market environment. He focused on the personalized needs of asset allocation, particularly providing several robust allocation plans for retirees, aimed at balancing returns and risks to ultimately achieve financial freedom and inner peace. Furthermore, from the height of life philosophy, the teacher elaborated on the importance of an investor&rsquo;s mindset, reminding investors to overcome the weaknesses of human nature. In the Q&amp;A session, he provided detailed answers to hot-topic questions from students regarding Taiwan&rsquo;s credit lines, how to explain investing to young people, the use of leverage, the mechanism of stablecoins, and their profound impact on the future financial landscape (especially the status of the US dollar and the stock market). Overall, this session offered a comprehensive guide for investors, encompassing macroeconomic outlooks, micro-level operational advice, and deep philosophical insights.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No need to pay attention to market signals</strong>: Market disturbances (like tariffs, wars) are irrelevant to long-term investing; the market will eventually rise, and approaching or even setting new highs is normal. Investors need not worry about short-term signals.
<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> The current market is full of turmoil, yet it&rsquo;s close to setting new highs, proving that short-term signals are inconsequential.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Learn from history, understand the present</strong>: The century-long history of the U.S. stock market shows that while it doesn&rsquo;t repeat, it rhymes astonishingly. Understanding history helps solidify long-term investment beliefs. Mr. James shares insights based on his 40 years of market experience and understanding of 200 years of U.S. market history.</li>
<li><strong>Optimism and patience</strong>: Investors should always be extremely optimistic and unaffected by external pessimism and fear-mongering. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t listen or look, it doesn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo; Wealth is worth waiting for; investing requires patience.</li>
<li><strong>Technical analysis is ineffective</strong>: Those who believe technical analysis is effective haven&rsquo;t truly grasped investing. Market fluctuations can sometimes be like &ldquo;madness&rdquo;; no need to dance to its tune.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQQ)</strong>: This is currently the fastest-growing passive ETF globally, suitable for young investors to accelerate asset appreciation. Mr. James provides links to resources for investing in Nasdaq 100 Index Funds worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Learning resources</strong>: Recommends watching a series of videos (e.g., 00451 &ldquo;Value Investing Lecture&rdquo; as a compulsory course for newcomers, as well as 398, 399, 400, etc.), learning them in conjunction with the market conditions at the time to achieve a solid grasp.</li>
<li><strong>Getting started for young professionals/small investors</strong>: It&rsquo;s advised to set aside an emergency fund for six months to a year before starting to invest in QQQ or 00662 (a Taiwanese ETF tracking Nasdaq 100). Buy whenever you have money, don&rsquo;t try to time the market, buy at market price.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systemic traps of capitalism</strong>: Mr. James quotes and agrees with a YouTuber&rsquo;s perspective that capitalism is designed to favor the rich, reflected in:
<ul>
<li><strong>Tax mechanisms</strong>: Investment income (e.g., U.S. Long-term Capital Gains, tax-free for singles up to $40k/couples up to $80k, with rates of 15%-20% above that) is taxed at much lower rates than labor income (up to 37%), benefiting long-term investors. Taiwan doesn&rsquo;t even have capital gains tax.</li>
<li><strong>Triple risks for the middle class</strong>: Job, company stock, and property near the company are highly intertwined. If the company has problems, one might lose their job, stock value, and property (or face mortgage pressure) simultaneously. Advice: Sell company stock promptly and reinvest in QQQ; buy a house only after achieving financial freedom (&ldquo;buying a house should be like buying slippers&rdquo;).</li>
<li><strong>Differences in borrowing</strong>: The rich borrow money to get richer (investment), while the middle class borrows money to become poorer (consumption).</li>
<li><strong>Differences in income growth</strong>: Income from physical labor struggles to keep pace with inflation and asset appreciation.</li>
<li><strong>Differences in offspring development</strong>: Middle-class children rely on &ldquo;involution&rdquo; (cram schools, prestigious universities, spending hundreds of thousands to get into private schools), while wealthy children can pursue their interests and grow up happily.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of financial bubbles</strong>: The middle class is forced to sell assets at low prices when bubbles burst because they can&rsquo;t hold on, while the rich have the money and opportunity to buy the dip.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Utilizing capitalism</strong>: Despite its pitfalls, the capital market is an important way for ordinary people to bridge the wealth gap and share the dividends of social progress.
<ul>
<li><strong>At the national level</strong>: If citizens all become capitalists, holding shares in globally competitive companies (like TSMC, Apple), they can enjoy the benefits of globalization while &ldquo;transferring&rdquo; negative externalities of production (like pollution). Citizens should ponder: Is it better to be proud of owning a factory, or proud of owning shares in that factory?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Borrow 100 Million&rdquo; thought experiment</strong>: If someone were willing to lend you 100 million (any currency) at 5% interest, to be repaid in 40 years, would you dare to borrow it? Those who dare and know how to use it possess a rich mindset, because this money, through investment, can generate returns far exceeding the interest, potentially allowing for immediate retirement. The key is whether you have the credit or assets to borrow this sum.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration from Trump&rsquo;s proposed &ldquo;Great Child America Act&rdquo;</strong>: Investing $1,000 annually for newborns from a young age cultivates financial literacy and long-term compound interest awareness, reflecting a nation&rsquo;s soft power. This is more meaningful than direct subsidies.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beyond &ldquo;cost&rdquo; thinking</strong>: Falling in love, getting married, and having children should not be calculated as &ldquo;costs.&rdquo; With a long-term wealth perspective (e.g., 1 million becoming 1 billion in 40 years), money is meant to be spent, and family is for sharing love.
<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> If you only think about the immediate 1 million not being enough, you miss the possibility of becoming a billionaire enjoying life in the future. By 60-70, even with money, you might not be able to make up for regrets from youth (like having children).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Die with Zero&rdquo; philosophy</strong>: Life should be fully experienced, rather than dying with a huge fortune, which is the tragedy of &ldquo;having nothing but money.&rdquo; Money should be spent wisely to create beautiful memories.</li>
<li><strong>Financial wisdom for couples</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic security</strong>: The higher-earning spouse should proactively transfer a portion of their funds (e.g., 50k from a 150k salary) to the other&rsquo;s account, giving them financial freedom and security, avoiding the need to &ldquo;report everything&rdquo; or &ldquo;ask for money.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Common goals</strong>: Couples should have aligned financial views, invest together, and not bicker over money (like who does the dishes or takes out the trash). A home needs love.</li>
<li><strong>Improve oneself first</strong>: In a family, first make yourself &ldquo;worthy of being loved.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Becoming the &ldquo;big tree&rdquo; of the family</strong>: Through long-term investment, everyone has the potential (hundreds of thousands becoming hundreds of millions, millions becoming billions) to become the family&rsquo;s economic pillar, providing shelter for loved ones.</li>
<li><strong>Elderly care for parents</strong>:

<li><strong>Health is the biggest money-saver</strong>: Instead of worrying if pensions are sufficient, care more about parents&rsquo; health, manage their blood pressure and blood sugar, ensure they take medication on time, and have regular check-ups (e.g., for macular degeneration, joints, carotid artery stents). Healthy parents mean a lighter burden for children.</li>
<li><strong>Cost estimation</strong>: If parents are completely dependent, a caregiver plus basic expenses might cost NT$80,000-100,000 per month. Mr. James&rsquo;s mother cost about NT$10 million over 10 years.</li>
<li><strong>Plan early</strong>: When children are 30, parents are around 60. Significant expenses might arise after age 80. Regularly investing NT$1,000-2,000 per month for parents can accumulate a considerable pension fund after 20 years.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Simplify investing</strong>: Once asset allocation is done, you can set it to &ldquo;autopilot,&rdquo; no need to watch the market daily or analyze asset performance. Spending 5 minutes once a year for rebalancing is sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>Risk awareness</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Market goes to zero&rdquo; test</strong>: Before any investment decision, ask yourself, &ldquo;If this investment goes to zero tomorrow, can I handle it? Even if I can&rsquo;t sell stocks for three years, can I survive?&rdquo; If not, the risk is too high.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity risk</strong>: Some markets or specific situations (like some mainland China ETFs in 2022) may experience situations where you want to sell but cannot.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage risk</strong>: Margin loans (e.g., from a brokerage account) are extremely risky. A market downturn can lead to margin calls or even negative equity (e.g., stocks drop to $800k, but you borrowed $1 million, owing $200k). Personal loans (with stable income, used for investment) are relatively manageable because they are not directly tied to stock market value for forced liquidation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The essence of learning</strong>: It&rsquo;s not just about learning what works, but more importantly, learning that &ldquo;these things are useless&rdquo; (like technical analysis, economic analysis, business cycle indicators). This conclusion is reached after understanding these tools.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Observed some people nearing retirement with no stable income wanting to borrow money to invest. However, their understanding of investment philosophy and risk tolerance might be insufficient. Advised such individuals not to borrow easily; they should first build a solid foundation with their own funds and become mentally strong enough before considering advanced operations.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: Strongly agree. Investors first need to experience market volatility (e.g., a 10-15% correction) with their own funds to confirm they can tolerate it before considering borrowing. For retirees:
<ul>
<li>Personal loans: If there&rsquo;s no stable income for repayment, a market downturn will force selling stocks to repay debt, which is not recommended.</li>
<li>Mortgages: A home equity line of credit (HELOC, interest-only payments, like in the US) might be considered; however, mortgages requiring principal and interest payments are not recommended due to the large amounts involved.</li>
<li>Core principle: For any leveraged investment, consider, &ldquo;If the stock drops to zero, the loan still needs to be repaid. Can I handle it?&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: As a listener for over two years, he gradually shifted personal funds, private equity, trusts, and insurance products into QQQ and domestic Nasdaq ETFs. Due to excessive optimism, he used margin (brokerage account overdraft to buy) from late 2023 to early 2024, almost at 1:1 leverage. He then encountered the &ldquo;tariff war&rdquo; and liquidity issues in the domestic ETF market (e.g., 513100), where some ETFs hit their limit down and couldn&rsquo;t be sold. He was forced to significantly deleverage the next day, wiping out much of the previous year&rsquo;s profits. His father&rsquo;s account, with no leverage and regular investments, hit an all-time high. Profound realization: Don&rsquo;t rush to make money; slow is fast, and safety is more important. Personal cash flow and future income expectations are crucial when using leverage. Also, in panic, he cleared out QLD from his Hong Kong account, missing the subsequent rally. This experience reminded him of the 2015 A-share market crash, also involving margin calls and being unable to sell for three consecutive days.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: Sams&rsquo; experience is very typical. Markets have liquidity risks, and margin risks are enormous, potentially leading to margin calls or even owing the brokerage money. Repeatedly emphasized the importance of the &ldquo;market goes to zero test.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t test human nature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Investing allows one to control their own destiny. He experienced his company being acquired, then another company he co-founded being acquired (sold to Evergrande, which later defaulted, and got entangled in lawsuits), and personally shutting down an underperforming branch (decided to close the Chongqing branch after a three-hour walk with his boss; employees were given N+1 severance the next day). Because he had investments as a backup, he was more composed when facing these changes. Colleagues without investments (like some branch managers) felt lost about their future. Insight: Whether in good times or bad, hold on to good assets.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: All things have unexpected events (companies go bankrupt, properties get damaged). When investing, first think about risk. Jobs and individual stocks carry high risks. QQQ will also drop significantly. Only invest money you won&rsquo;t need for 15-20-30 years. Retirees need to set aside about 15 years of cash for living expenses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: Mr. James once suggested 70% QQQ / 30% cash, and allocating 2% to leveraged funds (like QLD) in down years. He wanted to confirm:
<ol>
<li>Can mainland China and Hong Kong accounts be treated as one, with a synchronized 70/30 allocation?</li>
<li>Since transferring funds out of mainland China is troublesome, should more leveraged funds be allocated in Hong Kong?</li>
<li>If the market falls at year-end, is the 2% allocation to leveraged funds based on 2% of total assets or only 2% of Hong Kong assets?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s reply:
<ol>
<li>For beginners or those sensitive to volatility, 70/30 (QQQ/cash) or even 60/40 is a safe starting point. No need to rush into leveraged funds. Because even if the overall drop isn&rsquo;t large, the violent fluctuations of leveraged funds themselves can cause anxiety (e.g., only focusing on QLD dropping 5%, not seeing that cash doesn&rsquo;t drop).</li>
<li>Beta can start at a lower level (e.g., 0.6-0.8) and gradually increase with experience and asset growth.</li>
<li>Regarding the 2% QLD allocation: It can be calculated based on Hong Kong assets or total assets. However, note that leveraged funds usually cannot be used as collateral for bank loans (e.g., at HSBC). If QLD proportion is too high, it might affect future collateralized financing plans.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Listening to Mr. James&rsquo;s class is like learning life philosophy; investing is a battle against human nature. Experienced the recent market correction (what the teacher called a &ldquo;slap in the face&rdquo; market). Although he wanted to hold on, he was scared and sold half of his holdings, including some individual stocks like Nvidia.</li>
<li>Question: His Roth IRA account is small, and he&rsquo;s nearing retirement. He wants to know if an allocation of 60% QQQ + 10% TQQQ + 30% cash, or 70% QQQ + 20% TQQQ + 10% cash, resulting in an overall Beta of around 0.8, is robust enough while also providing growth.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s reply: A 60/10/30 (QQQ/TQQQ/cash) configuration, with a Beta around 0.8, is very good. Beta will increase as the leveraged portion grows. For those afraid of volatility, an initial Beta of 0.6-0.8 is sufficient.</li>

Investing slowly and waiting for the compounding effect is a good choice.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: Slow is fast. Don&rsquo;t use money you need to earn money you don&rsquo;t need. Life should be about reducing regrets, not chasing empty fame and fortune.

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Introduced to Mr. James&rsquo;s philosophy by a friend in 2018/2019. As a stock market novice, he was deeply inspired and immediately adjusted his strategy, investing borrowed funds and continuing with regular contributions. He once participated in short-term trading studies (joined a stock reading club) but found it arduous and the ROE (Return on Equity) not high. He had to watch the market daily, research US stocks, Taiwan stocks, margin changes, aiming for a 10-20% annualized return, and only dared to invest a portion of his capital (e.g., 10-30%). So he gave up, focused on his main job and long-term investing, and now lives a peaceful and prosperous life (meditating morning and evening). When sharing his philosophy with friends and colleagues, he found they hesitated to invest for their own long-term (feeling 20-30 years is too long), but were more receptive to investing for their children, which might then lead them to participate themselves. Having experienced 00662 (a Taiwanese Nasdaq 100 ETF) dropping from over 50 to the 40s and persisting in buying, he is now calm about current market fluctuations.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: Many short-term traders only look at the ROI (Return on Investment) of individual trades, ignoring the ROE (Return on Equity) on their total assets. They might achieve a high ROI with a small amount of capital, but it contributes little to overall wealth growth. For example, with 1 million in capital, using 30,000 to make 30,000 is a 100% ROI, but only a 3% ROE. Whereas we aim for a 10% return on the entire 1 million, which is 100,000.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Noticed Mr. James recently emphasizing conservatism more, suggesting a 30% cash position (earlier it was 10-20%). Is this due to varying student experience levels or other considerations? He himself targets a Beta of 1.0, holds leveraged funds, has little cash, and would need to reduce leveraged funds to reach 30% cash.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s reply: Yes, this is because students come from diverse backgrounds; many are novices or cannot withstand significant volatility. A 30% (or even 40%) cash position is a &ldquo;plain beef noodle soup&rdquo; style basic version, suitable for everyone to start with. Experienced investors who can tolerate risk can adjust it themselves, choosing a &ldquo;mildly spicy&rdquo; or &ldquo;extra spicy&rdquo; allocation. Asset allocation is very personal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Regarding wealth inheritance. Warren Buffett&rsquo;s testamentary portfolio (90% S&amp;P 500 + 10% short-term bonds) is suitable due to his vast assets. For ordinary people whose descendants have no interest in investing, how should a &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; trust asset allocation plan be established? (Citing Anita Mui&rsquo;s trust case)
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s reply:
<ul>
<li>Firstly, children&rsquo;s moral character and values education (quoting Lin Zexu: &ldquo;If my descendants are like me, what&rsquo;s the use of leaving them money? If my descendants are not like me, what&rsquo;s the use of leaving them money?&rdquo;) is more important than wealth inheritance. Wealth should be the icing on the cake.</li>
<li>One can start considering gifting when their assets exceed 50 times their annual expenses.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not advisable to easily set up a private non-profit foundation unless the children are genuinely committed, otherwise, it might become a burden or a management problem.</li>
<li>Trust selection: Trust services from large financial institutions (like HSBC, Charles Schwab) are generally more stable than private family offices (even if the institution fails, assets are protected, like Credit Suisse being taken over by UBS), but offer less flexibility. One can set up a portfolio like 70% QQQ / 30% cash (or short-term bonds/money market funds), with a rule to withdraw 2% annually, achieving perpetuity. The key is simplicity and low management fees. Private family offices might offer comprehensive services, but institutional trusts focus more on asset management and distribution.</li>

<p>Market fluctuations have nothing to do with me anymore. The market might be full of turmoil, tariffs coming and going, wars still ongoing, but the market is already close to new highs. So this is why you don&rsquo;t need to care about market signals; they are not important, not important at all.

<blockquote>
<p>Earning money through physical labor will never keep up with inflation, let alone the speed of asset appreciation.
&ndash; Mr. James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view highlights the fundamental difference between labor income and capital appreciation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you calculate falling in love, getting married, and having children in terms of cost, then you&rsquo;re being too meticulous&hellip; We are rich people; money is meant to be spent. We&rsquo;ll have more money than we can spend in a lifetime, so if we get married and have children, let&rsquo;s have a few more to spend it together.

<p>Slowly is fast. You will all become a big tree for your family.
&ndash; Mr. James (combining the &ldquo;slow is fast&rdquo; and &ldquo;become a big tree&rdquo; concepts)</p></blockquote>
<p>This view encourages long-term patient investing, believing in the power of compounding to enable individuals to become the economic pillars of their families.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For any asset allocation, just ask yourself: what if the market goes to zero tomorrow, how would you fare? Ah, if you find out it&rsquo;s not okay, if I&rsquo;m finished if it goes to zero, then you should quickly adjust your asset allocation.
&ndash; Mr. James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view provides an ultimate test for measuring risk tolerance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone needs to know that in investing, all things can have unexpected outcomes. Your company can go bankrupt in an instant&hellip; So for any investment, the first thing to think about is what if this investment is destroyed, goes to zero, what will you do?

<p>This view emphasizes risk awareness, that any investment should first consider the worst-case scenario.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think about making this money too quickly; a bit slower and safer might be better.
&ndash; Sams</p></blockquote>
<p>Sams, after a severe setback with leverage, gained a profound understanding of prudent investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s the biggest advantage of investing well? It&rsquo;s that you can control your own destiny.
&ndash; Sams</p></blockquote>
<p>Sams shared how investing gave him more agency and security amidst career and life changes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spending five minutes a year is enough. There&rsquo;s absolutely no need to care about market fluctuations; it&rsquo;s completely meaningless&hellip; Living a good life is the purpose of life.

<p>In this CLEC sharing session, Mr. James once again emphasized the importance of long-term holding of quality assets (especially the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund) and reminded investors to ignore market noise and focus on their own investment discipline. He deeply analyzed the operational mechanisms of capitalism, pointing out that ordinary people can achieve wealth growth through capital markets and escape the &ldquo;laborer mindset.&rdquo; The discussion covered several important topics, including risk management (especially a cautious attitude towards using leverage, advising most to start with a conservative cash ratio, and conducting the &ldquo;market goes to zero&rdquo; test), the wisdom of wealth inheritance (emphasizing children&rsquo;s moral education first and suggesting simple, sustainable trust solutions through financial institutions), elderly care for parents (prioritizing health management over financial worries), and balancing investment with life happiness (avoiding excessive calculation of &ldquo;costs&rdquo; in life, living in the present, and achieving the state of &ldquo;Die with Zero&rdquo;). Participants&rsquo; sharing also provided valuable practical experiences and lessons, particularly regarding leverage risks, market liquidity, and the profound impact of investment on personal control over one&rsquo;s destiny. Overall, this session aimed to help investors establish the correct investment mindset and methodology to achieve long-term financial health and a fulfilling life.</p>
