<p>Many of us spend our entire lives struggling with money, working tirelessly for monthly bills, children&rsquo;s tuition, and meager retirement savings, like a hamster trapped in a cage, running hard but never escaping. Have you ever considered that you could have been richer? Have you ever thought that the sense of security you seek actually binds you, causing you to miss out on greater wealth?</p>
<p>Yes, everyone has an innate talent for wealth, a right we are born with, as natural as breathing, as natural as birds flying and fish swimming. Unfortunately, this right, this talent, has been forgotten, or even buried by our own hands through the &ldquo;education&rdquo; of reality and the &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; of society. From a young age, we are told: study hard, find a good job, work hard to earn money to support the family. No one tells us: you can be very rich, you have the right to be very rich, you don&rsquo;t even have to work so hard to have it all!</p>
<p>The value of this lecture is far more than teaching you one or two investment techniques; its true value lies in awakening you from that “hamster dilemma,” making you realize your dormant wealth potential, and showing you a path to financial freedom. This path does not require you to have Einstein&rsquo;s brain, nor does it require you to have Buffett&rsquo;s luck, it only requires you to change your mindset, and then, to move forward steadfastly.</p>

<p>The extent of your vision dictates the height of your wealth. This isn&rsquo;t just some motivational slogan; it&rsquo;s a conclusion derived from rigorous logic and data analysis. Don&rsquo;t believe it? Let&rsquo;s crunch some numbers.</p>
<p>Many people find investing for something decades into the future to be too distant and unrealistic. But what if we look 60 years into the future? If you have 1 million now, through sensible investments and factoring in the power of compounding, you could have assets worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in a few decades. This is entirely possible; it’s actually a conservative estimate.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t ordinary people realize they can have so much wealth? The reason is simple: our concept of money is too narrow, we have insufficient understanding of our potential, and we lack a deep understanding of compounding, the &ldquo;eighth wonder of the world!&rdquo; Our understanding of money is still at the kindergarten level, while financial giants have a Ph.D.-level understanding of money, at least.</p>

<p>Why is it so hard for most salaried workers to escape the &ldquo;rat race&rdquo; dilemma? Because they are trapped in a carefully designed cycle: you work hard for a month, and before the paycheck even warms up, it has to go to capitalists, the government, and the bank. For that meager salary, you have to work like a rat running tirelessly in a cage, never escaping that vicious circle.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that society constantly brainwashes you with &ldquo;consumerism,&rdquo; telling you that buying big houses, luxury cars, and branded bags is the standard for successful people. So, you&rsquo;re burdened with heavy loans, barely able to breathe under the weight of monthly interest payments. You don&rsquo;t dare to quit your job easily, and you don&rsquo;t dare to challenge your boss. You become a complete slave to capital.</p>
<p>Do you think this is your own choice? Do you think it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re not working hard enough? No! This is a structure intentionally or unintentionally maintained by the entire society and education system. What do schools cultivate? Compliant cogs in a machine, not independent-thinking creators. Financial institutions design complex financial products, ostensibly to help you manage your money, but in reality? They earn high fees and interest, while you can&rsquo;t even outpace inflation.</p>
<p>This “controlled environment” prevents you from realizing your potential for wealth, let alone changing your situation. You are like that hamster in the fable, the faster you run, the further you get from freedom.</p>

<p>Poverty is not your fault; it is the result of social structures that create class inequality. This structural inequality is like a thick curtain that obscures your innate talent for wealth, making you believe that you can only live a poor or middle-class life.</p>
<p>The statement &ldquo;wealth is a talent&rdquo; is not just a platitude, but a declaration, a solemn proclamation of your right! It tells you: you have the right to pursue a life of abundance, you have the right to enjoy beautiful things, you don&rsquo;t have to sacrifice your health, your happiness, or your dreams for money!</p>

<p>What is money? Money is a kind of energy, a tool. In a capitalist society, money can be used to exchange for various resources and services, including time, happiness, health, and even freedom. Money can also be used for investment, growing more money like seeds.</p>
<p>But remember, money itself is not the goal, but a means to achieve our life goals. We make money not to become slaves to it, but to live better, to realize our own dreams and those of our families, to have the ability to help those in need, and to better serve society.</p>
<p>Only by truly understanding the essence of money can we view it and use it correctly, rather than being enslaved by it.</p>

<p>Can ordinary people really achieve financial freedom? The answer is: of course they can! Moreover, achieving financial freedom is much simpler than you imagine.</p>
<p>The key to financial freedom is not about having a high IQ, or mastering complex techniques, but rather whether you have the correct investment mindset and whether you can persevere in executing it.</p>
<p>The path to financial freedom for ordinary people is actually very simple: choose the right investment vehicle, hold it for the long term, and let the power of compounding increase your wealth like a snowball. Specifically, it&rsquo;s recommended to invest in the U.S. Nasdaq 100 index fund, a relatively low-risk investment choice with excellent long-term performance. In the long run, its annualized return is considerable.</p>
<p>Many people might say, investing in index funds, isn&rsquo;t that something even an idiot can do? Yes, it&rsquo;s that simple! But the problem is, how many people can truly hold on for the long term?</p>
<p>Financial freedom is not achieved overnight; it requires patience and perseverance. In the course of investing, you will encounter all sorts of challenges and temptations, but as long as you believe in your choice and continue steadfastly, you will surely reach the other shore.</p>


<h3 class="relative group"><strong>Shedding the &ldquo;Poor Mindset&rdquo;: From &ldquo;Impossible&rdquo; to &ldquo;I Can Do It&rdquo;</strong>

<p>The biggest characteristic of the &ldquo;poor mindset&rdquo; is self-limitation. They habitually limit themselves with &ldquo;impossible,&rdquo; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; and &ldquo;too difficult.&rdquo; They don&rsquo;t see their potential or the hope for the future.</p>
<p>The key to shedding the &ldquo;poor mindset&rdquo; lies in changing your mindset and recognizing your wealth potential and rights. You have to believe that poverty is not your destiny, and that you have the ability to change your fate.</p>
<p>Specifically, you need to learn the right investment knowledge, rather than being led by so-called financial experts or the media. You need to understand that true wealth comes from long-term investment, not short-term speculation or blind consumption. You need to learn to delay gratification, using the money you save for investment, rather than for buying things that are non-essential.</p>
<p>More importantly, you need to cultivate the ability to think independently, not to be swayed by others or blindly follow trends. You need to develop an investment plan suitable for your own circumstances, and then steadfastly execute it.</p>
<p>Finally, you must remember that financial freedom is not something that happens overnight; it requires patience and perseverance, believing in the power of compounding, and adhering to long-term investment.</p>

<p>Why invest? The answer is simple: to make money work for us, not us for money.</p>
<p>Through investing, we can make our money grow continuously in the capital markets, thus realizing an increase in wealth. This increase can help us withstand inflation, ensure our future quality of life, and ultimately achieve financial freedom, so we no longer have to toil for a living.</p>
<p>Investing is also a way to plan for and secure the future. Through investment, we can accumulate funds for retirement, prepare for our children&rsquo;s education, and create conditions for realizing our dreams. Imagine, when you retire, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about whether your pension is enough, you can travel the world freely, do things you love, what a wonderful life that would be!</p>
<p>In addition, investing is also a way to participate in economic development. By investing in excellent companies, we can share the dividends of their growth, and also create value for society, promoting social progress.</p>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<p>Why is it better to start investing early? The answer lies in the word &ldquo;compounding.&rdquo; Compounding, which Einstein called the &ldquo;eighth wonder of the world,&rdquo; is more powerful than you think.</p>
<p>For example, if we calculate with a 12% annual rate of return (a figure that can be achieved over the long term), a 30-year-old who invests $283 per month can accumulate approximately $1 million by the age of 60. But if they started investing at the age of 20, they would only need to invest $85 per month to reach the same goal!</p>
<p>See that? That is the power of compounding! The earlier you start investing, the less principal you need, and the shorter the time it takes to achieve your wealth goals. Because the effect of compounding causes your wealth to grow like a snowball, the longer the time, the faster the growth rate, and the greater the power.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if you don&rsquo;t have much capital right now, as long as you start investing early and stick with it over the long term, you can accumulate a considerable amount of wealth. Time is the best friend of investment.</p>

<p>Many people think bonds are a stable investment, and some even say they&rsquo;re safer than stocks. Is this really the case?</p>
<p>In the long term, bonds can actually be riskier than stocks. Don&rsquo;t believe it? Let&rsquo;s look at the data. How have different asset classes performed over the past 200 years, from the early 19th century to the early 21st century? The results show that the long-term returns of stocks are far higher than those of bonds, and bonds have sometimes even lost money over periods of 20 or even 30 years!</p>
<p>Why is this the case? Because the yield on bonds is usually low, making it difficult to withstand the erosion of inflation. Moreover, bond prices are affected by interest rate fluctuations and carry some risk. In contrast, although stocks fluctuate more in the short term, they have higher growth potential in the long term.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about real estate. Many people believe that buying a house is the most value-preserving investment, and some even consider their house their most important asset. However, have you ever considered whether real estate is really a good investment?</p>
<p>From an investment perspective, the main problems with real estate are its poor liquidity, high maintenance costs, and unremarkable long-term returns. Imagine if someone spent 10 million Taiwan dollars to build a villa 35 years ago, could that villa be worth 30 million Taiwan dollars 35 years later? It’s unlikely. However, if they had invested that 10 million Taiwan dollars in the stock market, based on historical average returns, the current value would have increased by two orders of magnitude, possibly becoming 1 billion Taiwan dollars!</p>
<p>More importantly, real estate also involves complex factors such as location and market fluctuations, all of which can affect its investment returns, and ordinary people find it difficult to control them.</p>
<p>And what if you treat your home as a place to live? Then you&rsquo;ll be burdened with decades of loan payments, and monthly mortgage repayments will weigh you down. For this house, you have to work hard, not dare to quit easily, and not dare to pursue your dreams, you become a complete “house slave.” Isn&rsquo;t that putting the cart before the horse?</p>
<p>Remember, a home to live in is essentially a consumption, not an investment.</p>

<p>For ordinary people, investing in individual stocks requires specialized knowledge and a lot of effort, and the risks are also relatively high. Is there a simpler, more effective way for us to share in the dividends of U.S. technological development?</p>
<p>The answer is: the Nasdaq 100 index fund.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq 100 index fund includes the 100 largest and most representative non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq, which include many well-known tech giants such as Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.</p>
<p>These companies represent the future development direction, the future of technology, with strong innovation capabilities and huge growth potential. By investing in the Nasdaq 100 index fund, we are investing in these excellent tech companies at the same time, sharing in the generous returns from their growth.</p>
<p>Moreover, investing in index funds is very simple, transparent, and relatively low-cost, making it particularly suitable for ordinary investors to hold for the long term. Compared to actively managed funds that require a lot of time and effort for research, index funds often outperform in the long run.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq 100 index fund is more focused on the tech sector compared to other broad market indices, which means it has higher growth potential. If you believe that technology is the core driving force behind future development, then the Nasdaq 100 index fund is an investment choice you cannot afford to miss.</p>

<p>The method of investing in index funds is really simple: choose a good index fund, such as the Nasdaq 100 index fund, and then buy in regularly, holding it for the long term. It&rsquo;s that simple. You don&rsquo;t need a background in finance, nor do you need to monitor the market every day. You can even leave it untouched for years.</p>
<p>But why is it that so few people are actually able to do this simple thing?</p>
<p>First, it requires you to have a long-term perspective and firm conviction. During market fluctuations, especially when the market is down, many people feel panic and anxiety, and even doubt their choice, eventually giving in and selling, and as a result? They often sell at the lowest point, missing out on the rebound that follows.</p>
<p>Second, it requires you to overcome your human weaknesses. In the course of investing, you&rsquo;ll encounter all sorts of temptations: today, this stock has hit its limit up, tomorrow, that concept is hot, the day after tomorrow, experts predict the market will plummet… this noise will interfere with your judgment, leading you to deviate from your original investment plan.</p>
<p>Many people, even those who have learned this simple investment method, still cannot do it well. Some investors are impatient to sell as soon as the market rises slightly, missing out on the big gains that come later; some investors, although they have set a fixed investment plan, are always unable to stick to it, going at it haphazardly; and other investors, because they hold other types of stocks or investments, are unable to make up their minds to switch to index funds.</p>
<p>What does all of this show? It shows that the success of investing depends not only on the method, but also on your mindset, whether you can overcome your human weaknesses, and whether you can steadfastly execute your investment plan.</p>
<p>Investing in index funds requires &ldquo;patience&rdquo; and &ldquo;waiting,&rdquo; the determination to &ldquo;stay the course&rdquo;, which is what most people lack.</p>

<p>The path of investment is full of all sorts of &ldquo;pits,&rdquo; and one wrong step can lead to total ruin.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Financial Expert&rdquo; Scam:</strong> Many so-called &ldquo;financial experts&rdquo; are actually just salespeople for financial products. In order to earn commissions, they will recommend various complex financial products to you, such as insurance, bonds, annuities, etc. These products often come with high fees and less-than-ideal long-term returns. Annuity products in particular, are not only low-yielding and high-risk, but also severely impact your asset allocation and tax planning. Remember, truly good investments are often simple, and those complicated products are often traps.</li>
<li><strong>Noise from the Media and &ldquo;Experts&rdquo;:</strong> Many media outlets and so-called &ldquo;investment experts,&rdquo; in order to grab attention, publish all sorts of sensational market predictions. One minute they&rsquo;re saying a bull market is coming, the next a bear market is coming, and the next, that a certain industry is about to explode… This noise severely interferes with your judgment, making you unable to focus on long-term investment. Remember, what really matters is the long-term trend, not the short-term fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>The Temptation of Short-Term Trading:</strong> Many people dream of getting rich overnight, so they like to buy and sell frequently, trying to capture every market fluctuation. However, short-term trading not only requires you to have superb skills and keen market intuition, but also to bear enormous risks. For ordinary investors, short-term trading is often not worth the effort, and can even lead to serious losses. Frequent trading is like a gambler in a casino, often eventually losing it all.</li>
<li><strong>The Risks of High Leverage:</strong> Some investors, in order to pursue higher returns, use excessive leverage, such as margin accounts. However, leverage is a double-edged sword, it can amplify your returns, but also amplify your losses. If used improperly, it can easily lead to total ruin, and even bankruptcy. Remember, the first priority of investment is to control risk, not to pursue high returns. Never put your fate in the hands of luck, especially not with leveraged fate.</li>
<li><strong>The Risk of Not Learning:</strong> Many people know nothing about investment. They don&rsquo;t understand the essence of investment, nor their own risk tolerance, nor the characteristics of the products they are investing in. Such blind investment is like crossing the road with your eyes closed, full of risks.</li>

<p>&ldquo;Buy when you have money.&rdquo; These four words sound very simple, even a bit &ldquo;silly,&rdquo; right? But they are based on a deep understanding and insight into the long-term trends of the market.</p>
<p>We all know that the long-term trend of the market is upwards, driven by economic development and technological progress, and it&rsquo;s an unstoppable historical trend. Although the market will fluctuate in the short term and even fall sharply, these are all temporary. In the long run, the market will always return to the upward trend and continue to reach new highs.</p>
<p>Many people always want to buy at the lowest point and sell at the highest point. But ask yourself, do you really have the ability to do this? Not to mention ordinary investors, how many professional fund managers can actually do it?</p>
<p>Trying to choose the best time to buy is often futile, even foolish, because no one can accurately predict market bottoms and tops. Instead of wasting a lot of time and energy researching market trends, it&rsquo;s better to adopt a &ldquo;buy when you have money&rdquo; strategy, and use that time and energy to work and live life, enjoying life to the fullest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never sell,&rdquo; these four words, don&rsquo;t they sound a bit extreme? But they are the secret to enduring market cycles, the essence of long-term investing.</p>
<p>The essence of investing is to share in the growth dividends of excellent companies, not to gamble, in a casino, diving in and out. The logic behind &ldquo;never sell&rdquo; is actually very simple: as long as you are investing in excellent companies, and as long as you believe that these companies can continue to grow, then you should hold them for the long term, sharing in the dividends that their growth brings.</p>
<p>Frequent buying and selling will not only increase your transaction costs, but will also cause you to miss out on the compounding effect of long-term holding. More importantly, it will expose you to human weaknesses.</p>
<p>When the market is falling, you will feel panicked and will want to sell; when the market rises, you will become greedy and will want to chase after the price increases. As a result? You are often buying high and selling low, and are constantly harvested by the market.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;never sell&rdquo; strategy can help you overcome fear and greed, and allow you to always stay in the market, sharing in the dividends of economic growth.</p>

<p>Market downturns, for many people, are a nightmare, a disaster. But for true investors, they are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>
<p>Why is that? Because when the market is down, the stock prices of many high-quality companies will be severely undervalued, like a discounted sale, and buying at this time is like picking up a bargain.</p>
<p>Warren Buffett once famously said, &ldquo;Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.&rdquo; This quote is about this very principle.</p>
<p>Market downturns are temporary, while the market&rsquo;s long-term trend is upward. As long as you can overcome your fear and stick to your long-term investment strategy, you will be able to seize opportunities during market downturns, buy undervalued high-quality assets, and lay a solid foundation for future wealth growth.</p>

</h3>
<p>The strategy of &ldquo;living off stock pledges&rdquo; can help you address your daily capital needs without selling your stock. This is a smarter way to manage finances.</p>
<p>Many people might ask, what is a stock pledge? Simply put, it is using your stock as collateral to borrow money from a financial institution. In this way, you can gain access to liquidity without selling your stock, and you can continue to enjoy the long-term appreciation of your stock.</p>
<p>Through stock pledges, you can avoid being forced to sell stocks with long-term growth potential due to temporary funding shortages. Furthermore, in many countries and regions, the capital gains tax rate is usually higher than the borrowing interest rate. Through stock pledges, you can also reasonably reduce your tax burden.</p>
<p>Of course, stock pledges also carry some risks. If the stock price drops sharply, you may need to provide additional collateral or face the risk of forced liquidation. Therefore, when using stock pledges, you must control your leverage ratio, and it is generally recommended that the pledge ratio not exceed 20% of your total assets.</p>

<p>In this age of information overload, we are bombarded daily with all sorts of information, especially in the field of investment. The opinions of various &ldquo;experts,&rdquo; various media reports, and various rumors, are difficult to distinguish between true and false, making people dizzy.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the ability to think independently, you can easily be swayed by this information and make wrong investment decisions.</p>
<p>Independent thinking is key to investment success. It means having your own judgment, not blindly following trends, not blindly believing in authority, and not being swayed by market sentiment.</p>
<p>The basis for independent thinking is learning and research. You need to continuously learn investment knowledge, study market laws, and understand the investment target. Only in this way can you form your own investment system and make correct decisions in the complex market environment.</p>
<p>Always remember that investment is your own business, and no one can make decisions for you.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Overthink Market Volatility:</strong> It is emphasized that ordinary investors do not need to over-focus on global affairs, short-term market fluctuations, company financial reports, etc., as these factors have limited impact on long-term investments. It points out that investors who frequently engage in short-term trading often &ldquo;pick up pennies and lose dollars,&rdquo; wasting both time and life.</li>
<li><strong>CLEC&rsquo;s Position:</strong> It is stated that CLEC (the club) is a non-profit investment and financial management channel that does not provide professional investment advisory services, nor does it receive any returns from members.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Warning:</strong> Investment involves risk; markets go up and down. Proceed with caution. Members need to conduct their own risk assessment and control and be responsible for their investment decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Asset Allocation:</strong> Over the past year, CLEC has continuously emphasized safe asset allocation, which is key to managing market risk and achieving steady long-term returns.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Video Resources:</strong> James has divided the four-hour-long video 00451 into short videos of about 15 minutes, making it easier for new members or those with limited time to learn. The short videos are subtitled in Chinese, English, and other languages to cater to members from different linguistic backgrounds.</li>

<li><strong>Necessity of Learning for New Members:</strong> For new members who have just joined CLEC, James recommends that they take the time to watch previous videos and systematically learn CLEC&rsquo;s investment philosophy and strategies to avoid repeatedly asking questions or making incorrect investment decisions due to misunderstandings.</li>
<li><strong>Answering Complex Questions:</strong> Some complex questions cannot be explained clearly through simple messages or emails. These questions often require a comprehensive analysis combining multiple videos and strategies, which members need to learn systematically to grasp.</li>
<li><strong>Refusal to Do Out-of-Scope Simulations:</strong> James clearly states that he will not consider scenarios beyond situation 1 to situation 9, nor will he do simulations outside of CLEC&rsquo;s investment framework for individual members.</li>
<li><strong>Global Investment Information:</strong> NASDAQ 100 index funds are available in many countries and regions around the world. James has compiled information from various locations into a document for members to easily access.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Context:</strong> It is emphasized that investments need to be viewed in the context of the current market, with a long-term perspective. It&rsquo;s important to believe that the market will eventually rise, investments require patience, and wealth accumulation takes time, using time to reap the great benefits of compound interest.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>New Zealand Tax System:</strong> The tax system in New Zealand is similar to that in Australia. Even if stocks are not sold, tax is required on unrealized capital gains.</li>
<li><strong>Overseas Investment Tax:</strong> In New Zealand, unrealized capital gains from investments in overseas markets (such as buying US stocks like QQQ or NDQ) are subject to tax, with a high tax rate of 33% - 39%.</li>
<li><strong>Tax Avoidance Strategies:</strong> The USG fund issued in New Zealand may serve as a temporary tax avoidance measure, as investment in this fund may not require the payment of unrealized capital gains tax.</li>
<li><strong>ASB Securities Pledge:</strong> In New Zealand, ASB Securities can provide stock-pledged loans. The loan ratios vary depending on the fund. For example, some funds can borrow 65%, 70%, or even 50%.</li>

<li><strong>Advocating Spiritual Consumption:</strong> James encourages everyone to engage in spiritual consumption, which are consumptions that leave no material trace and cause no environmental pollution. For example, the enjoyment of staying in a good hotel for a few thousand dollars may be better than buying a useless decorative item, as material possessions become old, break down, and are eventually discarded over time.</li>
<li><strong>Choice of Transportation:</strong> Whether to take a 40-minute bus ride or drive a 20-minute car depends on which method makes you feel more comfortable and less anxious. If it doesn’t cause anxiety, it’s a good choice.</li>
<li><strong>Reducing Material Desires:</strong> We should think about “what can we do without” rather than “what do we want.” Reduce our dependence on material goods, avoid buying unnecessary or excessive items, and focus on basic life necessities, such as healthy food.</li>
<li><strong>Rational Shopping:</strong> When shopping, rationally assess the practical use of the item and avoid blindly following trends in consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth Accumulation for Young People:</strong> Young people should try to reduce unnecessary spending and use the saved funds for investments to accumulate wealth more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Pursuit of Spiritual Eternity:</strong> Our goal is to pursue spiritual and investment eternity. Reduce material desires, simplify life, and use money for things that can bring long-lasting spiritual enjoyment.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Challenges for Retail Investors in Stock Picking:</strong> Retail investors picking individual stocks is like trying to find good fruit in a basket full of rotten fruit. The result is often that the more you pick, the more you mess things up.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Cutting Losses:</strong> James uses the analogy of a broken elevator to illustrate that if an investment is losing money, it’s better to cut the loss and get on a different elevator (investment) rather than to continue waiting or trying to fix the broken one. When investment goes wrong, one should cut losses decisively instead of holding or averaging down.</li>
<li><strong>Capital Safety:</strong> James advises investors not to send funds overseas, but to keep them locally or in Hong Kong for capital safety.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t Blindly Pick Stocks:</strong> When individual investors can&rsquo;t distinguish between good and bad stocks, they should avoid stock picking to prevent unnecessary losses.</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledging Limitations:</strong> Investors need to acknowledge their cognitive limitations and their ignorance; this is the essence of investment wisdom.</li>

<li><strong>Cautious Cross-Border Investment:</strong> James points out that if stock investments in Taiwan are not performing well, it&rsquo;s even more unwise to venture into overseas markets like the U.S., because competition in those markets is much more intense.</li>
<li><strong>Two Strategies to Address Losses:</strong> For investors who are losing money in Taiwan stock investments, James gives two pieces of advice: sell all individual stocks and buy 00662 ETF at market price, and hold for the long term; or sell all stocks and put funds in bank deposits, and exit the stock market entirely to avoid further losses.</li>
<li><strong>Contributions of Taiwanese Retail Investors:</strong> James points out that Taiwanese retail investors contribute over 150 billion NTD annually in transaction taxes to the government, so the government is motivated to encourage day trading and other short-term transactions.</li>

<li><strong>Application of Beta Coefficient:</strong> In the US, adjusting the portfolio&rsquo;s beta coefficient to 1.2 is equivalent to using 20% leverage for investments.</li>
<li><strong>Order of Leverage Use:</strong> James suggests that investors first adjust the portfolio beta coefficient to 1.2, and then consider using credit, mortgages, and other forms of leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Borrowing Investment Strategy:</strong> After borrowing, it is still recommended to invest according to the 442/433 asset allocation ratio.</li>
<li><strong>Opposing Opportunism:</strong> James points out that some investors are always looking for various investment techniques or shortcuts instead of learning diligently, which is not recommended.

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing 1: <strong>Convenience of Having Funds.</strong> Brian shared his experience of seeing a dentist in Taiwan. Since he had ample funds, he could pay in cash, unlike some people with limited finances who might experience delays due to cash flow issues. He felt the convenience of having funds.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Agreed with Brian&rsquo;s point, stating that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really good to have money&rdquo; as it can solve many problems and can even &ldquo;buy&rdquo; better relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 2: <strong>Taiwan Living Experience.</strong> Brian chose to stay at a hotel instead of with his parents when returning to Taiwan. He felt that staying at a hotel offered more freedom and fewer constraints. Furthermore, when eating out, he could pay for himself instead of his parents or in-laws, which gave him a sense of financial independence and control.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Suggests that family gatherings in Taiwan can be held in hotels, and if family members are willing, they can also stay at the hotel together, using money to obtain a more comfortable living environment and a higher quality of life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 3: <strong>Fund Allocation and Investment Strategies.</strong> Brian re-adjusted his fund allocation based on James’s investment philosophy. He found that even in the worst market conditions (e.g., a 20% market drop), his funds were still safe. He used funds from broker loans and investment returns and calculated that even after retirement, if he continues to invest a fixed amount each year, his “visualization rate” would not be lower than 200%. He believes the Excel spreadsheets provided by James are very helpful for understanding how funds grow and managing asset allocation.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Affirming Brian&rsquo;s approach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 4: <strong>Building Confidence in Borrowing for Investment.</strong> Brian believes that if he never uses borrowing, he might feel psychological resistance when he actually needs to use it. Therefore, he started to try using broker loans and considered reinvesting the borrowed funds. He believes that practical operation can help better understand how to use borrowing and find the most suitable way.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Shared his own experience, that he uses borrowed money as much as possible, rather than spending his own money, when travelling or eating out. He emphasizes that his assets will never be spent, and any income will immediately be used to buy QQQ. He further explains that buying 00662 actually helps the Taiwan Central Bank activate its foreign exchange reserves, reduce inflationary pressure, and also activate idle capital in Taiwan. However, safe asset allocation is a prerequisite for borrowing to invest. Without understanding safe asset allocation, one cannot use this tool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding his fund allocation, should he put QQQ and QLD into a Roth IRA, and then use the borrowed funds for other investments, such as buying TQQQ, and whether his current fund allocation is reasonable and carries any risks?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regarding Asset Allocation:</strong> Brian&rsquo;s current approach is to invest some funds in QQQ, some in QLD (2x leveraged QQQ), and keep some in cash. James points out that when Brian&rsquo;s retirement account doesn&rsquo;t have much money, it is not very efficient or risk-free to pledge and put the money in the broker investment account, and to use leveraged funds (such as QLD).</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Black Swan Events:</strong> James emphasizes that Brian needs to have sufficient cash, exceeding the amount of his brokerage loans. This is to prevent &ldquo;black swan events,&rdquo; i.e., unpredictable major risk events.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended Asset Allocation:</strong> James suggests Brian puts QQQ and QLD into his Roth IRA account, and either keeps the traditional IRA account as cash or keeps enough cash in his brokerage account, ensuring that the cash amount exceeds the borrowed amount.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding 442/433 Allocation:</strong> James further explains that 442 and 433 are just references, and the specific asset allocation ratio needs to be adjusted according to individual situations. He emphasizes several key principles: have enough cash, and have more cash than borrowed money; the ratio of leveraged funds should not exceed the ratio of the original funds (such as QQQ). For young people, they can do a 442 allocation at the highest, meaning the ratio of leveraged funds and original funds are the same.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Allocation Adjustments:</strong> James points out that after allocating assets according to the 442 ratio, the ratio of leveraged funds will automatically increase as the market rises, which is normal. Because assets are increasing, and cash is also increasing, the overall safety is actually much higher than the beginning.</li>

<li>
<p>Sharing 2: <strong>Building a Habit of Borrowing for Investment.</strong> Peter shared his experience with borrowing for investment, believing that it&rsquo;s a habit that needs to be cultivated. Only by being accustomed to this operation will one not feel unfamiliar or resistant to borrowing when assets reach a certain scale (e.g., 1 million, 2 million). Peter also mentioned that in the investment process, you need to construct two curves in your mind: one is the total assets curve rising, and the other is the total liabilities curve also rising, but the slope of the total liabilities curve should be less than that of the total assets curve. This way, assets will increase over time, while the proportion of liabilities will decrease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 3: <strong>Negotiating Lower Loan Interest Rates with Banks.</strong> Peter shared his experience negotiating lower loan interest rates with the bank. He mentioned that loan interest rates can be negotiated with the bank. He personally called the bank and successfully lowered his loan interest rate by 0.7%. He encourages everyone to not be afraid to try, to take the initiative to communicate with the bank, and to fight for lower loan interest rates.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 5: <strong>Importance of Spiritual Consumption.</strong> Peter highly agreed with the concept of &ldquo;spiritual consumption&rdquo; put forth by James.

<p>Question 1: Regarding funds management in Roth IRA and investment accounts. Terry mentioned that he has 401k, Roth IRA, and brokerage accounts in the US. He wants to know if he can use leverage in a Roth IRA account, and whether he must borrow via his brokerage investment account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restrictions on Retirement Accounts:</strong> James clearly stated that retirement accounts (such as 401k, Roth IRA) cannot be used as collateral, meaning one cannot use assets in retirement accounts to borrow. Only assets in a broker&rsquo;s investment account can be pledged for loans.</li>
<li><strong>Role of IRA Assets:</strong> James explained that while IRA assets cannot be used directly to pledge for borrowing, the amount of assets affects the interest rates of the loan. When brokers evaluate the borrower&rsquo;s overall financial situation, they consider the assets in the IRA account, which might lead to more favorable interest rates. However, the amount of assets in an IRA account does not determine how much can be borrowed.</li>
<li><strong>Calculating Loan Amounts and Interest Rates:</strong> James explained how loan amounts and interest rates are calculated. The amount that can be borrowed is usually 60% to 70% of the assets in the investment account. The interest rate on the loan is determined by a combination of factors, including the base lending rate, the size of assets in the investment account, and the size of assets in retirement accounts such as IRA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Can one increase income by selling Covered Calls for QQQ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opposing Covered Call Strategy:</strong> James explicitly opposed the Covered Call strategy that Terry suggested. He believes the strategy is not necessary and carries high risks.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Covered Call:</strong> James explained that if a Covered Call strategy is used and the market suddenly rises significantly, the options would most likely be exercised, forcing the investor to sell QQQ at the agreed price (usually below market price), thus missing out on the profits from the rise. Alternatively, the investor would need to pay more funds to repurchase QQQ.</li>

<li>
<p>Sharing: <strong>Recognition of CLEC and James&rsquo;s Investment Philosophy.</strong> Jason first expressed his gratitude to CLEC and James, believing that they bring surprises each year. From the initial advice of &ldquo;sell individual stocks, sell actively managed funds, and go all-in on QQQ&rdquo; to last year&rsquo;s &ldquo;asset allocation,&rdquo; this year&rsquo;s &ldquo;continuous optimization of asset allocation,&rdquo; and now the &ldquo;442&rdquo; and &ldquo;433&rdquo; allocation, James&rsquo;s investment philosophy and strategies are constantly evolving and improving. This has helped investors avoid external interference and truly achieve &ldquo;not being overjoyed by external gains, and not being saddened by external losses.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: When doing a &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; of asset allocation, if the predetermined ratios are not met, for example, if the ratio of leveraged funds has not yet reached the requirement of a &ldquo;433&rdquo; allocation, is it still necessary to perform &ldquo;smart rebalancing?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trigger Conditions for Rebalancing:</strong> James explained that if the ratio of leveraged funds has not reached the predetermined target, for example, the 442 ratio, there is no need to do &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; for the time being. You can wait until the ratio reaches or exceeds the predetermined target before adjusting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Regarding how to solve children&rsquo;s university tuition fees. Jason mentioned that university fees in the US are very high, especially for out-of-state students, where tuition and living expenses could reach 100,000 USD annually. Some of his friends are considering &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; some funds, such as by purchasing annuities, insurance, or transferring funds to others&rsquo; names to apply for student aid to alleviate financial burdens. He would like to know what advice James has on this matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opposing the Practice of &ldquo;Hiding Money&rdquo;:</strong> James strongly opposed the practice of &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; funds to save on university fees. He believes this practice is counterproductive and may even be illegal.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages of Annuities and Insurance:</strong> James pointed out that investing funds in annuities or insurance may reduce the amount of assets needed for disclosure in the short term, potentially qualifying for more student aid. However, it results in a huge loss of investment returns in the long term. He uses an example of 500,000 USD; if that amount was used for investments with an annual return of 14%, it could grow to 1.3 billion USD in 60 years. Whereas if that money is invested in annuities or insurance, the rate of return would be much lower, and the liquidity of the funds would be restricted.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Risks of &ldquo;Hiding Money&rdquo;:</strong> James specifically emphasized that transferring funds to others&rsquo; names, for example, to parents in China, and then having parents send funds back to the US annually, is suspected of money laundering and fraud, which is a serious criminal act in the United States. If discovered, there are severe consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Suggested Practice:</strong> James suggested that instead of &ldquo;hiding money,&rdquo; the money should be used for investments to grow the wealth. Even if one does not help their children pay for university fees, children can apply for student loans themselves. When they graduate and the assets have grown in value, one can use that to help repay the loans.</li>
<li><strong>Other Options:</strong> James also mentioned that children can earn some of their living expenses by working part-time or at a side job, such as driving a rideshare or doing other small part-time jobs, where they can earn tens of thousands of USD each year.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing 1: <strong>Personal Investment Experience and Confidence.</strong> Opa shared his experience of going all-in on QQQ. He bought it at the peak of the market, and although it declined for some time, his investment recovered to the previous high by the first half of this year and is now highly profitable. This experience has given him great confidence in long-term investments and a deeper understanding of bear markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 2: <strong>Daughter&rsquo;s Investment Experience and Transformation.</strong> Opa mentioned that his daughter previously had more faith in her financial advisor, and had given the advisor more than 1 million USD to manage. However, the advisor&rsquo;s investment strategy was too diversified, allocating assets across 20-30 ETFs, covering various indexes and small-cap stocks, which resulted in poor overall returns. Opa had been trying to persuade his daughter to change her investment strategy, but she would not listen. It was not until recently, after having two children, that she began to reconsider due to increased financial pressure. At a Christmas family gathering, Opa once again explained the power of compounding and the impact of the technology sector on productivity to his daughter. His daughter finally understood the importance of long-term and focused investments and plans to transfer about 2 million USD to a broker account that allows stock pledges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding the loan interest rate on 2 million USD in a broker account. Opa mentioned that according to the broker’s website, the loan interest rates for 2 million USD is still very high. He would like to know how to get a lower interest rate, and whether the loan interest rate is calculated based on total assets or the actual amount of the loan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Negotiating Lower Interest Rates:</strong> James first pointed out that loan interest rates can be negotiated with the broker. He suggests that Opa&rsquo;s daughter directly contact the broker and ask for a lower rate.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rate Calculation Methods:</strong> James explained that brokers take a number of factors into consideration when assessing the loan interest rate, including the borrower&rsquo;s total assets, loan amount, and duration of the loan. Generally, the larger the total asset, the smaller the loan amount as a percentage of the total asset, and the longer the loan duration, the lower the interest rate.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rate for 2 Million:</strong> James estimated the loan interest rate that Opa&rsquo;s daughter could receive based on her situation. He mentioned that the base rate announced on the broker&rsquo;s website was just a benchmark, and the actual rate would require further negotiations. He recommends that Opa&rsquo;s daughter directly contact the broker&rsquo;s staff member, Lisa, for a more detailed consultation. He also provided a calculation formula: 2.9% - 0.5% = 2.4%. 2.9% is the base interest rate for a 2 million loan in the brokerage, and 0.5% is the discount that Opa&rsquo;s daughter could get based on the size of her assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Regarding how to perform asset allocation. Opa’s current asset allocation is 811, which means 80% QQQ, 10% QLD, and 10% Cash. His goal is to adjust the asset allocation to 442, which means 40% QQQ, 40% QLD, and 20% Cash. He wants to know if it’s better to put leveraged assets (such as QLD) in the Roth IRA account, and the normal account in cash plus QQQ, to better maintain the correct ratio of the standard account during a bear market. Also, if there is a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; asset allocation plan, should all the funds in the Roth IRA be allocated to QLD, and the normal account to cash plus QQQ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interpretation of 811 Allocation:</strong> James first interpreted the meaning of the 811 allocation and said that there is nothing wrong with the allocation approach.</li>
<li><strong>View on &ldquo;Perfect&rdquo; Allocation:</strong> James believes that if one only has a Roth IRA account and a normal account, then it is acceptable to allocate all of the Roth IRA funds to QLD and allocate the normal account to cash plus QQQ.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility of Asset Allocation:</strong> James emphasizes that the specific asset allocation ratio should be adjusted based on individual situations. For example, it depends on the percentage of total assets that the Roth IRA account represents. If the Roth IRA account represents 40% of the total asset, then all the funds in the Roth IRA account can be allocated to QLD to reach the 442 allocation target. However, if the Roth IRA funds only account for a smaller percentage, say 20% or 30%, then the 442 target allocation cannot be reached, and the allocation will most likely be 622.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage Choices:</strong> James also mentioned that if one hopes to increase the percentage of the Roth IRA account to 40%, one can consider using 3x leveraged ETFs such as TQQQ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: Regarding the use of funds in his 401k account. Opa mentioned that he and his wife&rsquo;s 401k accounts are still in their respective company plans and cannot be rolled over until they reach the age of 65 (still two years away). He would like to know how to manage these funds now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Allocating Cash to the 401k Account:</strong> James recommended that Opa allocate cash to his 401k account, because the 401k account usually has some tax-saving policies. Keeping cash in the 401k account can take full advantage of these policies.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding QQQ’s Long-Term Investment Returns:</strong> James shared some data regarding QQQ’s long-term investment returns. He pointed out that QQQ’s annualized return over the last 5 years is approximately 19%, the annualized return over the last 10 years is approximately 17%, and the annualized return over the last 20 years is approximately 14%. He also points out that QQQ is accelerating human growth, and its future return might be higher and higher, therefore investments must be made.</li>

<li>
<p>Sharing 1: <strong>Observations and Reflections on Social Phenomena.</strong> Young shared an observation she made at work and in her life: many people work very hard in their respective fields and put in a lot of time and energy, whether it&rsquo;s running a business, working at a job. However, they do not give much importance to how they manage their money, or they don&rsquo;t know how to make effective investments. Young believes this might be because they do not understand investments, or they do not realize the importance of investments. She emphasizes that as long as one has the correct investment methods, they can achieve greater freedom in their work and life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 2: <strong>Risks of Insurance Products.</strong> Young has worked in the insurance industry for many years. She has come in contact with many clients and has seen many unreasonable insurance products. She gave a specific example: a client paid 500,000 RMB in insurance premiums every year for three years, totaling 1.5 million RMB. It has been 8 years now, and some years ago, this client borrowed over 800,000 RMB due to a cash shortage. If the client now wants to withdraw the policy, after deducting the borrowed amount, he can only get back 300,000 RMB. That is to say, he would still lose money. In addition, the client has never paid any interest on the loan. Young points out that the interest rate on policy loans in China is often 5%, while the return on the policy is only 3%. This means the interest paid annually by clients is far higher than the returns provided by the insurance company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 3: <strong>Agreement with James&rsquo;s Investment Philosophy.</strong> Young stated that she agrees with James&rsquo;s investment philosophy, especially the point that &ldquo;you shouldn’t try to make money that isn’t necessary.&rdquo; She believes that we should focus our primary time and energy on our work and lives, instead of spending a lot of time researching investment products such as stocks and funds. All one needs to do is to hold long-term investments in the stocks of the world&rsquo;s best 100 companies, and then spend more time enhancing our spiritual energy, being with our families, and enjoying life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question: Regarding the risks for clients opening an account in Hong Kong to purchase US Treasury bonds. Young mentioned that the interest rates on Chinese government bonds are very low, at about 1.6%, while the interest rates on US Treasury bonds are as high as 4.6%. Some people she knows are recommending that Chinese clients open bank accounts in Hong Kong, then exchange RMB into USD to purchase 5 or 10 year US Treasury bonds. She would like to know what risks are involved in such operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Need to Understand Specific Operational Details:</strong> James first pointed out that he would need to understand more specific operation details before he can assess the risks involved. He specifically mentioned that the normal procedure for treasury bonds does not require going through an insurance company, and he was unclear about the specific procedure and organizations involved in purchasing US treasury bonds, therefore he cannot provide concrete suggestions.</li>
<li><strong>Doubts Regarding &ldquo;High Returns&rdquo;:</strong> James expressed doubts about this kind of &ldquo;high return&rdquo; investment method. He believes that if there really was such a good investment opportunity, the insurance company&rsquo;s own funds would be invested, instead of recommending it to clients. He reminds everyone not to easily trust the so-called high-return and low-risk investment products, because there are often unknown risks behind them.</li>

<p>Question 1: Regarding asset allocation after retirement and calculating amounts for pledging and borrowing. Wave mentioned that she is planning to retire this year, and she would like to know whether she can pledge her stocks to borrow funds after retirement, and how to calculate the amount that can be borrowed. She also mentioned that her 30 year-old son would like to understand the issues of pledging and loans, and how to explain the methods of calculation to him, and where to find relevant information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation after Retirement:</strong> James first introduced two different methods of asset allocation after retirement:
<ul>
<li><strong>Not Pledging and Borrowing:</strong> If you are not planning to pledge and borrow funds, you can allocate 80% of your assets to QQQ and 20% to cash. Each year, you can use the cash part to pay living expenses, and rebalance at the end of the year, re-adjusting the ratio back to 80% and 20%.</li>
<li><strong>Pledging and Borrowing:</strong> If you plan to pledge and borrow funds, then you should adopt the 433 method of asset allocation, which means 40% QQQ, 30% QLD (2x leverage QQQ), 30% cash (or money market fund). Each year, you can borrow 2% of your total asset for living expenses, and also rebalance at the end of the year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Calculating Loan Amounts:</strong> James explained that the amount that can be borrowed depends on total assets and the type of asset. Generally, about 60%-70% of the total assets can be borrowed. However, different types of assets will have different ratios. For example, the amount that can be borrowed from QQQ is about 70%, while the amount that can be borrowed from cash and money market funds such as SWVXX can be as high as 96%.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding the Choice Between 442 and 433:</strong> James points out that for young people, 442 and 433 are both acceptable asset allocation options. The 442 allocation can achieve higher expected returns, but the risk is also comparatively higher; the 433 allocation is more stable. He suggests that Wave&rsquo;s son choose the allocation method most suitable for his personal risk tolerance and investment goals. If one plans to do pledging from the very start, 433 allocation can be considered, because the taxes paid will be less when making changes to the assets.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Learning Resources:</strong> James told Wave that he had organized and provided all of the articles and video links that covered the topics of asset allocation and pledging stock for loans, and she can find details on calculation methods and operation guides from these resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Regarding the view that “the estate will only be 1 million.” Wave mentioned that she recently saw a video by James that mentioned “the estate will only be 1 million in the future,” which moved her greatly. She believes that if one can increase one&rsquo;s wealth via borrowing for investment, and use that wealth for helping others during one&rsquo;s lifetime, that would be very meaningful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explaining &ldquo;Estate Will Only Be 1 Million&rdquo;:</strong> James explained that it does not actually mean that only 1 million will be left to the children as an estate, but that one should use investment loans to make the most of one&rsquo;s assets, so that one can do more meaningful things with the funds, instead of leaving all of the wealth to the children. He used an example of 300 million in assets. If 290 million are borrowed out, only 1 million will be left, but the 300 million in assets, and the 290 million in liabilities, can still be transferred to the children, and they can use that borrowed money and the rest of the assets.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Estate Planning:</strong> James also mentioned that in order to avoid high estate taxes, one can consider establishing a trust, and transferring assets into that trust, similar to how Buffet and Bill Gates do it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding the calculation and negotiation of interest rates on stock-pledged loans, and the impact of retirement account assets on borrowing rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Calculation:</strong> James explained that interest on stock-pledged loans consists of two parts: a fixed spread (also called fixed interest rate spread, which depends on the broker and borrower’s creditworthiness) and a floating rate (usually referencing SOFR, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate). For a loan of 1 million, if the fixed spread is 4%, the total borrowing rate may reach about 8% when combined with the floating rate.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rate Negotiation:</strong> James emphasized that loan interest rates are negotiable with the broker. He advises Julia to proactively communicate with the broker to negotiate a lower rate.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Retirement Account Assets:</strong> James pointed out that while assets in retirement accounts (such as IRA, 401k) cannot be directly pledged for loans, the amount of these assets impacts the borrowing rate. When assessing the borrower’s overall repayment ability and risk status, brokers will consider the assets in retirement accounts. If the assets in retirement accounts are substantial, the borrower might qualify for more favorable interest rates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: After opening an account, can one apply for a stock-pledged loan immediately? Will the borrowing limit be adjusted annually?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apply Immediately:</strong> James confirmed that one can apply for a stock-pledged loan immediately after opening an account.</li>
<li><strong>Limit Adjustments:</strong> James explained that the borrowing limit is calculated based on the asset value of the account, which will fluctuate with market conditions. Therefore, the borrowing limit is not fixed but is dynamically adjusted according to the market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: If there are investment losses, will the borrowing limit decrease?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yes:</strong> James clearly pointed out that if there are investment losses, leading to a decline in the account asset value, the borrowing limit will decrease accordingly. He gave an example: If there were originally 1 million in assets, the borrowing limit may be 700,000. If there was a loss of 300,000, leaving 700,000, the borrowing limit would become 490,000 (70% of 700,000). Brokers will re-calculate the borrowing limit based on the updated net asset value.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Adjustment of Borrowing Limits:</strong> James emphasized that brokers dynamically adjust the borrowing limit based on the real-time value of the assets in the account. This means if there are investment losses, the borrowing limit decreases. If there are investment profits, the borrowing limit increases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 4: What is the difference between stock-pledged loans and margin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Costs:</strong> James pointed out that the interest on margin loans is usually higher than that on stock-pledged loans.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Forced Liquidation:</strong> James explained that both margin and stock-pledged loans carry the risk of forced liquidation. However, margin has a stricter forced liquidation mechanism. When the net asset value of the account falls below a certain maintenance margin ratio, the broker will immediately force liquidation to recover the loan. Stock-pledged loans have a relatively more lenient forced liquidation mechanism. Brokers may give the borrower some buffer time or communicate with the borrower before forcing liquidation. Overall, the forced liquidation risk of margin loans is higher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 5: After borrowing funds, can they be used for investment?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No:</strong> James stated clearly that using borrowed money to reinvest in the stock market is illegal. He emphasized that brokers usually specify in the loan agreements that the loan cannot be used to purchase stocks or other investment products.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Violations:</strong> James explained that brokers can monitor the flow of funds, and although it may not immediately trigger forced liquidation, if such activities are discovered, it may lead to the account being frozen and loans being recalled with severe consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> James advises members to strictly comply with the broker’s regulations and use the borrowed funds for consumption or other non-investment purposes.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding the calculation of borrowing limits under a 433 asset allocation. Shawn mentioned that he is currently using a 433 asset allocation, which means 40% QQQ, 30% QLD (2x leveraged QQQ), and 30% cash. He would like to know if, when calculating his borrowing limits, the broker also includes the QLD component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>QLD is Not Included:</strong> James clearly stated that in a 433 allocation, the broker does not include QLD when calculating the borrowing limit. This means only the QQQ and cash parts are used to calculate the borrowing limit.</li>
<li><strong>Specific Calculation:</strong> James provided an example: If Shawn has 1 million in total assets, and the 433 allocation is 400,000 in QQQ, 300,000 in QLD, and 300,000 in cash, the amount that can be borrowed is 70% of the 400,000 in QQQ, which is 280,000, plus 96% of the 300,000 in cash (assuming the borrowing ratio for cash or money market funds such as SWVXX is 96%), which is 288,000. Combined, the total amount that can be borrowed is 568,000.</li>
<li><strong>Significance of the 433 Allocation:</strong> James explained that the significance of the 433 allocation lies in its balance of returns and risks. By allocating a certain percentage of leveraged funds (such as QLD), the expected return of the overall investment portfolio can be increased. At the same time, allocating a certain percentage of cash can reduce the risk of the investment portfolio and provide a buffer during market declines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: If the 433 allocation method is used and the total asset is 1 million, then borrowing 2% annually (20,000) may not be enough for retirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 Million in Assets Not Enough for Retirement:</strong> James agreed with Shawn’s point. He pointed out that if the total assets is only 1 million, even if 2% is borrowed annually, that would only be 20,000, which would not be enough for retirement.</li>
<li><strong>433 Allocation is for Total Assets:</strong> James emphasized that the 433 allocation is with regard to the total assets, not a single account. He advises Shawn to include all assets, including retirement accounts (such as IRA, 401k) and non-retirement accounts, in the 433 asset allocation framework.</li>
<li><strong>Allocation Across Different Accounts:</strong> James advises that QQQ and QLD should be allocated primarily to retirement accounts, because retirement accounts usually have tax benefits, allowing for tax deferral, thus enhancing the effect of compounding returns. The cash portion should primarily be allocated to non-retirement accounts to allow for ease of access when needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: Concerned about the possibility of hacking or accidental errors leading to the sale of QQQ; is there a way to restrict the selling of QQQ in the account?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Security Concerns:</strong> James stated he understands Shawn&rsquo;s concern because long-term holdings of QQQ, once sold, would lead to large tax burdens.</li>
<li><strong>Possibility of Restricting Selling:</strong> James said that he is not certain whether there is a function that directly restricts the selling of a specific stock in the account, as he does not work at a brokerage and is unclear about the specific operation permissions and function settings. However, he advises Shawn to contact the broker directly (for example, Lisa, whom he recommended) and inquire if they have the relevant settings or services.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthening Account Security:</strong> James emphasized that protecting the account is very important. He advised Shawn to take actions to strengthen the security level of the account, such as using a strong password, enabling two-factor authentication, and using a hardware security key.</li>

<ul>
<li>The reason why many retail investors lose money is that they are overconfident, trade frequently, chase highs and sell lows, and cannot understand the essence of the market. Acknowledging one&rsquo;s cognitive limitations is necessary to avoid making rash decisions, and to make more rational investment decisions.</li>

<p>Humanity is growing at an accelerating pace, and investment returns will get higher and higher.
&ndash; James</p>

<ul>
<li>This conclusion is based on data on QQQ&rsquo;s past 20 years of investment returns, and emphasizes the effects of compound interest due to technological developments. Long-term investment in high-quality assets that are representative of the direction of technological development allows one to share the bonuses of human progress.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Encourage borrowing for investment, leave only 1 million in the estate, show respect.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is based on long-term investments, compounding returns, and sensible asset allocation, allowing one to maximize wealth, and to use loans to enhance one&rsquo;s quality of life, or to help others. With sensible asset allocation, loans for investment can accelerate the growth of wealth, and not simply accumulating wealth to leave to the next generation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There are no shortcuts in investing, only through systematic learning and practice can one master correct investment methods.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is a message to those who are trying to find investment skills and shortcuts, but are unwilling to learn systematically. Investing is a complex field of study that requires continuous learning and practice in order to improve one&rsquo;s investment expertise.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>When you own equity assets in Wall Street stocks, you own the world.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is an emphasis on the importance of long-term holdings of high-quality equity assets. Stocks are not merely an investment tool, but also represent ownership of a company. By holding the stocks of the world’s best companies, one can share in the wealth generated by these companies worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t try to make money that isn’t necessary.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is to advise investors not to over-pursue short-term gains while overlooking the value of long-term investing. We should focus our main time and energy on our work and lives, instead of spending too much time researching short-term market fluctuations or attempting to earn the difference by trading frequently.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The numbers 442 and 433 are merely references, and the specific asset allocation ratio must be adjusted according to individual situations.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is to emphasize the flexibility and personalization of asset allocation. Each person has a different risk tolerance, investment goals, capital size, etc., and therefore, they need to devise the appropriate asset allocation plan based on their actual situation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Protecting account security is very important.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This reminds investors to take account security seriously, and to take the necessary actions to prevent the account from being stolen or accidentally mishandled. Because if this occurs, it will lead to severe losses, and especially for long-term held assets, the losses would be even greater.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: The chaos in the domestic insurance industry, where banks lure customers into buying insurance with high commissions, is even linked to the performance evaluations of customer managers. Many customers do not understand investments and choose low-yield or even risky insurance products to preserve their capital. He also shared a case of a friend who was defrauded of over 1.7 million in a romance scam, illustrating the complexity of the domestic financial environment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment</strong>: The US financial system strictly separates life insurance from other financial businesses, and there is no such thing as banks selling insurance. The financial supervision in China and Taiwan is problematic. Banks should focus on deposit and loan business and should not be involved in insurance and investment. This chaos will ultimately harm the interests of emerging countries.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: Took over the family food business ten years ago when the company&rsquo;s assets and liabilities were zero. After ten years of operation, the company turned a profit, and its current value (including real estate) is about 300 million NTD. Over the past decade, he distributed about 200 million NTD of revenue to his family, retaining 100 million NTD for loan purposes. Currently, he has invested 80 million in 00662 (a 2x leveraged Nasdaq 100 index ETF) and 20 million in 00631L (Taiwan&rsquo;s 50 Positive 2 ETF).
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment</strong>: None</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: The bank will allocate a loan of 60 million NTD on January 1st. Should this fund be used to buy 00662 all at once, or should he wait for a 20% market drop before buying? Also, if the market crashes and 00662 and 00631L go to zero, how will he deal with it?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: If the market goes to zero, the company can still make loan payments. The worst-case scenario is that the land is auctioned off, and he can still get tens of millions. Since the worst has been considered, how to buy the 60 million is not important. If it were me, I would buy it all on Monday. If you choose to wait for a 20% drop before buying, you can follow your plan and inform everyone when you buy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: How to maintain good health?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: Regular comprehensive physical examinations are necessary. I have been doing annual check-ups since my thirties. Wellness, like asset allocation, needs to be personalized. The advice I can give everyone now is to eat well, sleep well, and don&rsquo;t worry. What to eat specifically, what exercises to do, etc., need to be decided according to personal circumstances and cannot be given a unified recommendation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: What are your views on Taiwan&rsquo;s politics and how to support political parties?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: Regarding politics and religious beliefs, everyone has different positions and viewpoints. Discussing these issues in the classroom is meaningless and fruitless. It is recommended that students do not discuss these topics in the classroom and keep their opinions to themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 4</strong>: How to preserve assets in response to potential cross-strait issues? He currently has about 200 million NTD in assets in Taiwan and a house worth 8 million in Vietnam. How should he allocate his assets?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: If you can&rsquo;t sleep due to worries about cross-strait issues, it&rsquo;s recommended to immigrate as soon as possible. If you choose to stay in Taiwan, you need to make some decisions, such as whether to close the company. If the 40 employees are causing you distress, consider closing the company and compensating them. Life decisions should be decisive, not prolonged. Be responsible for your own happiness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Additional question</strong>: How to get rid of the shackles of the family business?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: You have managed the company very well. The choice is your life. Do whatever makes you happy. If the family business makes you unhappy, shut it down and give the employees a good severance package. Consider your own life, not your father&rsquo;s. If your father&rsquo;s business is no longer your concern, and it&rsquo;s not bringing you happiness, then let it go.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: Based in Canada, unable to leverage stocks. If income decreases in a certain year, and the tax rate drops from 32% to 24%, is it worth selling some stocks to increase income to the 32% tax bracket to improve the future cost basis?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: It is not recommended to sell stocks because selling incurs taxes. Canada&rsquo;s tax system is very unfavorable for stock investments. When immigrating, consider future generations and choose countries with development prospects. In Canada, you can consider using an IB account for loans, but this will face inheritance tax issues, possibly up to 40%. Therefore, when planning estates, minimize assets in IB accounts. In the long run, trusts can be used to avoid taxes. It is currently not recommended to sell stocks for short-term tax benefits. Consider selling after retirement when income is lower.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Additional explanation</strong>: IB accounts have a low financing ratio for Canadian stocks, only up to 50%.

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Through learning, I realized that my investment was too risky, and emergency funds should not all be invested in QQQ. Now I have withdrawn 36 months of emergency funds back to the Money Market Fund. When starting with small funds, one should focus on their main job and increase income sources. After investing in index funds, my mindset changed, and I began to focus on the importance of timing. Therefore, I started to focus on diet, fitness, and learning from the experiences of long-lived people around me. In addition, I learned from investing to avoid risks, such as giving up dangerous activities like diving.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment</strong>: It is wise to learn from the experiences of others. Being overly aggressive is human nature, but it is important to realize and correct it in time. It is wrong to increase positions when the market is rising and to be fearful when it is falling. It should be the other way around. Emergency funds should not be added to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How to judge whether you are being too adventurous? For example, increasing the leverage ratio of asset allocation from 1.0 to 1.8 when stocks are rising.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: This is also a necessary evil. Now that you realize it&rsquo;s not right, you can start to retreat, or when it rises, you buy in, and when it falls, you get scared. Oh, what to do? Then start to retreat. Once you have learned, don&rsquo;t do it again. So, as Buffett said, when others are greedy, you should be fearful, and when others are fearful, you should be greedy. That&rsquo;s the right pace. So, when you want to increase your position in the future, it should be when others are fearful. That&rsquo;s how I do it. This emergency fund should not be increased. Regardless of whether the market is rising or falling, you should not add to this cervical spine disease. How could you add to it? This is not allowed. Then, if you use our asset allocation, when the market falls, you automatically buy in for one year, and when the market rises, you automatically withdraw from the leveraged fund. This is passive, and this has already achieved the practice of being greedy when others are fearful and being fearful when others are greedy.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: You cannot borrow 200,000 all at once; you can only borrow 2% per year. When conducting asset-backed financing, the asset allocation should be 433, not 721. Borrow 2% each year and conduct &ldquo;smart rebalancing.&rdquo; Even if the market falls, you will not be forced to liquidate. The cash ratio may be lower than the loan ratio in extreme cases (such as a continuous 10-year decline), but since the total asset value is still greater than the debt, there will be no problem.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: A friend&rsquo;s experience. The friend took over his father&rsquo;s family business and eventually had health problems due to overwork. He later sold the company for over 600 million and invested the funds in QQQ. He is now very happy.

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: Regarding 401k and RMD. Previously, company stock was placed in a 401k, and now it has a high value, facing the RMD issue. After Trump takes office, is it possible to abolish RMD and change it to a 15% capital gains tax?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: This possibility is extremely slim. The government is unlikely to give up the tax revenue brought by RMD.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Regarding the Debt to Equity Ratio of companies. It is found that there are large differences in the debt-to-equity ratios of Buffett and many technology companies. Is this related to the nature of the industry? For example, the debt-to-equity ratio of software companies is usually low, while that of hardware companies like Apple is high. So, for individuals, is it a healthy level to control the debt-to-equity ratio at 0.2?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: The higher the debt-to-equity ratio, the higher the ROE usually is, but this needs to be based on healthy debt. Healthy debt refers to debt that can be repaid through its own operating activities, such as credit, stock-backed loans (under safe circumstances), and mortgages (that can be repaid). Apple&rsquo;s debt-to-equity ratio is high because it borrows a lot of money to pay dividends and places assets overseas. In addition, it has a large amount of accounts payable. Therefore, it cannot be simply considered that a high debt-to-equity ratio is bad. It is necessary to analyze the nature and safety of the debt specifically.</li>

</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: What are your thoughts on the Jetson Orin product launched by Nvidia? This product is mainly for the personal AI market, is cheap, can use ChatGPT to generate code, and runs locally, thereby creating your own AI database.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: I don&rsquo;t know much about this product. Our AI is mainly trained using ChatGPT as a personal assistant. Currently, I don&rsquo;t use other devices for personal AI.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Most people possess the ability to invest regularly, but they often choose the wrong target (real estate).</strong> The author uses the common phenomenon of &ldquo;mortgage slaves&rdquo; to illustrate that most people are unconsciously engaged in a form of regular investing – real estate.  Their monthly mortgage payments essentially constitute a form of regular investment. However, due to high interest rates and low liquidity, real estate is not the optimal choice. He contrasts this with the example of investing regularly in Kweichow Moutai stock for 18 years, resulting in a 180-fold increase, highlighting the significant advantages of stock investing in terms of long-term returns and liquidity.  This emphasizes the crucial importance of selecting the right investment target.  Due to mortgage burdens, many become &ldquo;mortgage millionaires,&rdquo; possessing seemingly large assets but lacking cash flow and a high quality of life.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of regular investment in stocks/index funds: low barrier to entry, high liquidity, potential for high returns.</strong> Compared to other investment methods like investing in early-stage startups or art, stocks and index funds have a low barrier to entry, making them accessible to everyone.  Moreover, they offer high liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell at any time, facilitating adjustments to their investment strategies as needed.  More importantly, over the long term, the stock market tends to rise with economic development, giving regular investment in stocks/index funds the potential for high returns. The author believes the stock market offers ordinary people an opportunity to share in the growth dividends of excellent companies, an advantage difficult to obtain through other investment avenues.</li>
<li><strong>The importance of participating in a regular investing community.</strong>  The author points out that regular investing is not just an investment strategy but also a social activity. Due to widespread misunderstandings and biases about stock investing (such as &ldquo;investment is risky&rdquo; or &ldquo;only the rich invest&rdquo;), investing regularly alone can be easily influenced by external factors, making it difficult to persist. Participating in a regular investing community can help investors overcome these negative influences, gain support and encouragement from peers, establish a correct investment philosophy, and learn more investment knowledge and experience. Within such communities, members can exchange experiences, share insights, and create a positive feedback loop.</li>

<li><strong>The stock market gives ordinary people the chance to be &ldquo;bosses&rdquo; and share in the growth dividends of excellent companies.</strong> The author believes the stock market provides a unique opportunity for ordinary people to invest in well-managed, high-quality companies and share in their profits, even if they have no understanding of business operations. This is an advantage difficult to gain even by working at a company, including publicly listed ones. Through investing, ordinary people can indirectly &ldquo;own&rdquo; multiple excellent companies, achieving wealth appreciation.</li>
<li><strong>A simple method for stock selection: choose the most favored stocks or index funds in the market.</strong> The author suggests that choosing stocks doesn&rsquo;t require complex analysis and research. One can directly choose the most popular stocks or index funds in the market, such as Kweichow Moutai, Apple, or Tencent.  These represent the collective wisdom of the smartest people in the market, and choosing them is akin to leveraging their free advice.  He further notes that the advice from the smartest people in the market is often free, like Warren Buffett&rsquo;s portfolio information and popular stock choices.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t worry about making the wrong choice; market consensus is more important than individual judgment.</strong> Even if the most favored stock in the market eventually fails, there&rsquo;s no need for excessive self-blame, as it represented the best available advice at the time.  Individual judgment rarely surpasses market consensus. In the long run, market forces will correct errors, so the key is to hold long-term and trust the power of the market.  The author believes that rather than spending significant time and energy researching individual stocks, it&rsquo;s better to trust the collective wisdom of the market and choose widely recognized, excellent companies.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investing in a single stock is high-risk, with unlimited opportunity cost, and requires diversification.</strong> Even the best-performing single company can face significant risks due to industry decline, black swan events, or other unpredictable factors. Concentrating funds in a single stock represents high risk, and losses can be difficult to recover if problems arise.  The author cites Kodak and Nokia as examples, illustrating how even once-great companies can decline. Hence, diversification is essential to mitigate risk.</li>
<li><strong>In the long run, the only investment that only goes up is human economic development, which can be accessed through index funds.</strong> The author argues that the human economy generally trends upwards over the long term, and index funds track the overall market performance.  By investing in index funds, one can effectively diversify risk and share in the dividends of long-term economic growth.  The 40-year performance chart of the S&amp;P 500 is compelling evidence.  Investing in index funds is like betting on the national, or even global, economy, and offers better odds in the long run.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term investment is necessary to dilute risk and ultimately achieve stable returns.</strong> Short-term market fluctuations are difficult to predict and are full of noise and randomness.  Only long-term investment can effectively smooth these fluctuations and ultimately generate stable returns.  The author emphasizes that there are no investment targets that only go up, only the long-term general upward trend of the human economy.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Regular investing is the most reliable investment method for ordinary people.</strong> The author uses the example of Longmen Fund, comparing lump-sum investing with regular investing. The results show that regular investing achieved a significantly higher return: 74.01% vs. 10.81%.  Regular investing can effectively smooth market fluctuations and reduce investment risk.</li>
<li><strong>Regular investing helps investors overcome fear and greed, maintaining rationality during market fluctuations.</strong> Through regular, fixed-amount investments, investors can buy more shares at lower prices during market downturns, averaging down their cost.  During market upturns, it prevents investing too much at once, avoiding being trapped at high prices.  The discipline of regular investing can help investors overcome the human weakness of chasing rising markets and selling during falls.</li>
<li><strong>Regular investing is a long-term strategy that requires patience and discipline.</strong> Returns from regular investing take time to accumulate. Investors need to be patient and maintain discipline, not easily interrupting or changing their investment plan, to achieve significant returns.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Fear of simplicity&rdquo; hinders people from accepting regular investing.</strong> People tend to believe in complex and sophisticated methods, underestimating the power of simplicity.  This is similar to how it took a long time for people to think of adding wheels to luggage, learning English through consistent reading aloud, improving writing through effective reading, and maintaining health through regular exercise.</li>
<li><strong>Regular investing&rsquo;s simplicity makes it easier to adhere to, avoiding the risks of frequent trading.</strong> Compared to complex trading strategies, regular investing is simple and easy to follow, avoiding transaction costs and the risk of misjudgment associated with frequent trading.  The author believes that this simplicity is precisely the greatest advantage of regular investing.</li>
<li><strong>People lack understanding and patience for long-term investing.</strong> Most people crave quick riches and struggle to endure the &ldquo;loneliness&rdquo; of long-term investing. They are easily influenced by short-term market fluctuations and often give up, as seen in the Longmen Fund example, where lump-sum investors were more prone to panic selling during market declines.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proactive personality is important, but recognize the boundaries of proactivity.</strong> Be proactive within your circle of influence, but also recognize your limitations.  Don&rsquo;t try to control what you cannot, such as your children&rsquo;s future or the operations of companies you&rsquo;ve invested in.</li>
<li><strong>Factors that determine destiny often lie outside our control, such as trends.</strong> Personal effort is important, but it&rsquo;s also essential to align with the trends of the times.  Like snooker player Ronnie O&rsquo;Sullivan, even with immense effort, competitors find it challenging to defeat him at his peak.</li>
<li><strong>Active passivity is the best strategy for navigating trends.</strong> Actively choose the right trend, then passively wait for the trend to unfold. In investing, this means actively choosing promising assets or indices for the long term, then passively adhering to a regular investment schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Regular investing is the best practice of &ldquo;active passivity.&rdquo;</strong> Choosing worthy long-term investments is active; regularly buying a fixed amount and holding long-term is passive.</li>
<li><strong>The power of passivity is fully demonstrated in long-term investing.</strong> The long-term performance of passive funds often surpasses that of actively managed funds, demonstrating the limitations of &ldquo;active management&rdquo; and the strength of long-term holding.</li>
<li><strong>Ordinary people can improve their investment abilities by controlling their own behavior, such as improving their ability to earn outside of the market.</strong>  Earning power outside of the market is the cornerstone of regular investing and a key factor ordinary people can actively improve.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding &ldquo;long-term&rdquo; determines investment outcomes.</strong> &ldquo;Long-term&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean forever, but &ldquo;at least two major cycles,&rdquo; which, based on market changes, is approximately seven years.</li>
<li><strong>Ordinary people&rsquo;s money has no expiration date, a significant advantage over professional fund managers.</strong> Professional fund managers are constrained by fund deadlines and investor pressure, while ordinary people can invest long-term with more composure, fully utilizing the power of time.</li>

<li><strong>Regular investing allows ordinary people to be passively intelligent investors from the start.</strong>  The strategy&rsquo;s simplicity avoids errors associated with complex operations, allowing ordinary people to achieve reasonable returns without becoming investment experts.</li>
<li><strong>Regular investing cultivates patience, discipline, and the habit of investing within one&rsquo;s means.</strong> Long-term regular investing requires patience and discipline. The investment amount should also be within one&rsquo;s means to avoid impacting daily life. These are all good investment habits.</li>

<li><strong>People with great goals are more likely to make the right choices in a mirrored world.</strong>  A sense of purpose allows focus on long-term value instead of being distracted by short-term fluctuations.  The author quotes Arnold Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s speech, emphasizing the importance of goals: &ldquo;The only reason I&rsquo;m standing here today is because I had a goal.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Imbuing what you do with great meaning can ignite powerful self-motivation.</strong>  A sense of meaning provides stronger motivation to persist. The author uses his own writing and teaching experience to illustrate the significance of meaning and encourages readers to find meaning in their regular investing, such as &ldquo;for the children&rsquo;s future&rdquo; or &ldquo;for early retirement.&rdquo;</li>

<li><strong>Investors who don&rsquo;t adopt regular investing easily fall into various investment traps, ultimately leading to losses.</strong> These include chasing rising markets, frequent trading, blindly following the crowd, and listening to rumors, often resulting in substantial losses during market volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Many investors blame their losses on greed, but the real root cause is a lack of understanding of the investment target.</strong> The author argues that greed is human nature and not the fundamental reason for investment failures.  The true cause lies in a lack of understanding of the investment target, an inability to judge its intrinsic value, leading to blind following or emotionally driven decisions, ultimately resulting in buying high and selling low.</li>
<li><strong>Even those who use regular investing need to deeply understand its core principles to avoid becoming half-baked investors.</strong>  This includes failing to carefully select investment targets, not holding long-term, investing too little, or easily interrupting the investment plan.  The author criticizes investors who don&rsquo;t truly grasp the essence of regular investing and merely engage in mechanical operations.</li>

<li><strong>The insignificance of effort: Ordinary people have limited free time, making it difficult to achieve significant success solely through hard work.</strong> The author uses data and personal experiences to illustrate that even with extraordinary effort, such as working 24 years without holidays or cutting his own hair, the gains are limited. He only managed to gain 1.26 years of effective working time compared to others.</li>
<li><strong>The essence of investing is to make money work for you, compensating for limited time and energy.</strong> Investing allows money to work 24/7, amplifying returns far beyond what one can earn through personal labor. Warren Buffett&rsquo;s 78-year investing journey serves as a prime example.</li>
<li><strong>Regular investing is an effective path for ordinary people to achieve financial freedom.</strong>  The strategy is simple and easy to execute.  Long-term adherence can generate substantial returns, helping ordinary people accumulate wealth and eventually achieve financial freedom.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Importance of Rebalancing:</strong> James stresses the importance of rebalancing at the end or beginning of the year. He recommends passive rebalancing, which means rebalancing when the market is performing well, to avoid panic selling during market downturns. He points out that many investors are reluctant to rebalance during market rallies, hoping to earn more, but end up succumbing to losses during declines and selling at the bottom, resulting in greater losses.</li>
<li><strong>Pledging Stocks for Tax Payment:</strong> He advises individuals with pledged stocks to borrow money for tax payments instead of selling the stocks to avoid increasing capital gains tax and to better utilize their funds. He emphasizes that under the premise of sound asset allocation and risk management, the borrowed money can be used flexibly.</li>
<li><strong>Real Estate Investment:</strong>  James advises against buying real estate, believing it restricts personal freedom. He uses the example of a friend in the Bay Area selling their property to support this viewpoint, pointing out the high holding costs of real estate, including property taxes, maintenance fees, and insurance, which can put significant financial pressure on individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Children&rsquo;s Education and Wealth Perspective:</strong> He suggests parents support their children&rsquo;s choices, believing that happiness is more important than wealth. Children shouldn&rsquo;t live for the sake of glorifying their family but should pursue happiness, serve others, and do what they love.</li>
<li><strong>433 Asset Allocation Plan:</strong> James recommends the 433 asset allocation plan (40% QQQ, 30% TQQQ, 30% Cash) for the general public, adjustable based on individual circumstances. For retirees who are not pledging stocks, he suggests an 80/20 allocation (80% index funds, 20% cash). For investors unfamiliar with or averse to leveraged ETFs, he recommends 100% investment in QQQ or 00662.</li>
<li><strong>Taiwan&rsquo;s Investment Environment Advantage:</strong> James highly praises Taiwan&rsquo;s investment environment, believing it possesses cutting-edge financial tools, tax-free policies, and low interest rates, making it an ideal place for investment. He encourages Taiwanese investors to leverage this advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Mid-Life Investment Strategy:</strong> He advises middle-aged individuals, even with modest incomes, to persist in monthly investments, accumulating wealth gradually for retirement. He illustrates the returns of monthly investments of 5,000 and 10,000 at retirement with specific examples.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of Nasdaq 100 Index Funds:</strong> James explains the rationale for investing in QQQ, stating that its constituent companies have strong profitability, focus on technology and innovation, and align with long-term human development trends. He also points out that the constituent companies of the Nasdaq 100 index have stronger profitability compared to the S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong>  He advocates for the &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, never sell&rdquo; strategy, ignoring short-term fluctuations and believing in the long-term upward trajectory of the market. He emphasizes that the purpose of investment is wealth appreciation, not short-term gains, and criticizes the drawbacks of short-term trading.</li>
<li><strong>The Difference Between the Rich and the Poor:</strong> James points out that the rich possess assets and credit, which they can use to &ldquo;print money&rdquo; through leverage for rapid wealth growth.  The poor, lacking investment knowledge, keep their money in banks, missing out on wealth growth opportunities. He uses the example of Warren Buffett issuing bonds to illustrate how the rich utilize credit for investment.</li>
<li><strong>Three Contributions of Investors:</strong>  First, allocating capital to the most efficient companies, promoting technological advancement; second, helping the government invest idle foreign exchange reserves; third, helping the poor activate their funds, maximizing their social value.</li>

<li>Question 1:  FNGS has performed better than QQQ. Can FNGS replace QQQ?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: No, because FNGS has excessive volatility and higher risk, illustrated by the 2000 tech bubble.  Emphasizes that asset allocation should consider volatility and maximum drawdown, not just performance. In the long run, QQQ offers better stability.</li>
</ul>

<li>Question 2: XLG has lower volatility than QQQ and decent returns.  Is it suitable for allocation?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: No, because XLG&rsquo;s long-term performance is inferior to QQQ. He provides a performance comparison of QQQ and XLG from 2006 to the present, showing QQQ&rsquo;s significantly higher returns.

<ul>
<li>People nearing retirement can consider using a revolving line of credit home loan (HELOC), treating the credit line as a part of their cash reserves for living expenses without touching the principal investment, thereby increasing overall asset returns.  For example, if someone has $40 million in retirement funds and obtains a $10 million HELOC, the total assets become $50 million, and the annual disposable funds increase from $800,000 to $1 million.</li>
<li>The HELOC credit line can supplement the 20% cash portion of asset allocation.</li>
<li>Note: It&rsquo;s easier to obtain a HELOC before retirement; it becomes more difficult afterward. The loan term typically doesn&rsquo;t exceed age 90.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing:  Shared her experience of investing most of her retirement funds in savings insurance a few years ago, resulting in much lower returns than expected. This year, she redeemed a portion of the funds and invested in QQQ, achieving better returns (13.68% in three months). However, with the current market reaching new highs, she&rsquo;s hesitant to invest further, finding it difficult to overcome the psychological barrier of &ldquo;buying with eyes closed.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: Courage comes from the subconscious and requires training.  Believe that the market will continue to rise and practice self-hypnosis to reinforce the &ldquo;buy when you have money&rdquo; concept. Used the example of QQQ potentially reaching $500,000 to illustrate that the current price is still very cheap.</li>

<li>Question 3: How to calculate retirement fund needs?  Can she receive social security?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Calculate retirement fund needs based on annual expenses. Alimony can be considered income, but it&rsquo;s recommended to claim social security (even if her ex-husband objects) and adjust the asset allocation ratio accordingly, as alimony is not a permanent income source. She needs to be prepared.  Also recommended switching from SWVXX to BOXX.</li>

<p>The market continues to reach new highs.  Investing doesn&rsquo;t require constant attention; the key is to stick to a long-term investment strategy, maintain a well-diversified asset allocation, and remain patient. The real risk isn&rsquo;t short-term volatility, but the inability to accumulate sufficient wealth over the long term, and not knowing how to utilize accumulated wealth effectively.  Furthermore, it&rsquo;s crucial to be wary of various financial traps and maintain rational investment practices.</p>

<ul>
<li>The market is at a new high. Don&rsquo;t waste time over-analyzing; stick to long-term investing, buy and hold.  The market generally trends upwards; instead of predicting pullbacks, enter the market early.</li>
<li>Investing doesn&rsquo;t require excessive time. After placing your order, step away and let time work its magic through compounding.</li>
<li>Be wary of scams. Don&rsquo;t trust any investment advice that guarantees stable returns or daily gains.  Be extremely cautious of &ldquo;guaranteed profit&rdquo; schemes.</li>
<li>Ignore the advice of financial advisors and insurance agents. They rarely have the investor&rsquo;s best interests at heart and are often motivated by their own profits. Many financial products are designed to benefit the seller, not the investor.</li>
<li>Investing isn&rsquo;t simple. Even asset allocation within a Nasdaq 100 index fund requires in-depth research and adjustments based on individual circumstances.</li>
<li>Investors should always remain optimistic. The market will eventually rise. Patiently await wealth accumulation. Time is an investor&rsquo;s friend.</li>

<li>The biggest risks are not market fluctuations, but the failure to accumulate sufficient wealth over the long term and not knowing how to utilize accumulated wealth effectively. The ultimate goal of investing is to achieve financial freedom and enjoy life.</li>
<li>Avoid the instinctive reaction to short-term losses. Overcome fear and don&rsquo;t panic sell. Market downturns are normal and present buying opportunities.</li>
<li>View bear markets as opportunities. Buying low translates to higher future returns. Learn to think contrarily and utilize market fluctuations for mindless rebalancing.</li>
<li>The investment objective is to mitigate the risk of financial hardship, not to maximize returns. A sound investment strategy is more crucial than chasing high returns.</li>
<li>Choose a simple, low-cost, passive index investment strategy, such as a Nasdaq 100 index fund, and hold a portion in cash to maintain psychological balance and cope with market volatility.</li>
<li>Holding safe assets (like certificates of deposit and money market funds) can mitigate short-term risks, stabilize emotions during market fluctuations, and provide a sense of security.</li>
<li>The proportion of safe assets held should be adjusted based on age and risk tolerance. Retirees are advised to hold cash equivalent to 5 years of living expenses, while those yet to retire can hold more.</li>
<li>Young people should prioritize term life insurance to protect their families and avoid other types of insurance to prevent being misled by insurance companies.</li>

<li>Avoid over-investing in real estate. Maintain ample cash flow. Real estate has poor liquidity and is difficult to liquidate.</li>

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: In 15 years, the 8x annual expenses will grow to 50x due to compounding, enabling retirement. Suggested a BETA of 1.2 to increase investment returns, or driving for Uber a few hours a week to accelerate wealth accumulation and achieve early retirement.

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Explained Modern Monetary Theory (MMT).  U.S. national debt represents savings held by the public. The U.S. government&rsquo;s debt is repaid by Americans. The value of the dollar lies in its credit and the goods and services it can buy, not the level of debt. The government can stimulate the economy by issuing national debt without worrying about excessive debt.

<p>&ldquo;The first investment earns the most; that performance can never be replicated.&rdquo;
&ndash; Monica</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Monica&rsquo;s statement highlights the importance of early investment and the difficulty of timing the market. Early investments enjoy higher returns, and over time, even with the same investment strategy, it&rsquo;s hard to replicate those early gains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The U.S. government&rsquo;s debt is the public&rsquo;s savings.&rdquo;
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This perspective challenges the traditional understanding of national debt, emphasizing the unique nature of U.S. Treasury bonds.  U.S. national debt represents dollar-denominated assets held by U.S. citizens and global investors, reflecting confidence in the American economy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Survival is key, not maximizing returns.&rdquo;
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement pinpoints the core goal of investing, reminding investors not to be tempted by high returns at the expense of risk management. Preserving capital is more important than chasing high returns during market fluctuations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Time is an investor&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;

<p>This lecture focuses on the importance of long-term investing and asset allocation, especially the significance of holding cash (undamaged capital). James reiterates the idea that &ldquo;the only constant in the market is volatility&rdquo; and advises investors to adopt a &ldquo;buy and hold&rdquo; strategy similar to Warren Buffett&rsquo;s, investing long-term in Nasdaq 100 index funds (QQQ or 00662). He uses a rent vs. buy case study to demonstrate the advantages of long-term index fund investing. He also explains in detail the importance of maintaining undamaged capital (cash) in asset allocation to buy the dip during market downturns, thereby achieving long-term stable investment returns.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Long-term Holding:</strong> Investing requires a timeframe of 20+ years, ideally forever, without worrying about short-term market fluctuations. James uses Warren Buffett as an example, emphasizing the importance of long-term holding, stating that if one isn&rsquo;t prepared to hold for the long term, they shouldn&rsquo;t even hold for 10 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in the US:</strong> The US is the best country for fairness, justice, and open innovation, so invest only in the US.</li>
<li><strong>Index Funds:</strong> Invest in Nasdaq 100 index funds (QQQ/00662), and recommends new viewers watch introductory videos 00451, 288, and 398.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility:</strong> The only constant in the market is volatility. Ignore market fluctuations and adhere to long-term holding. The 2022 market correction was just a financial event, not a bubble.</li>
<li><strong>Bubbles:</strong> Bubbles are rare, occurring only twice in the past 25 years. The best way to deal with them is to ignore them and continue holding index funds.</li>

<li><strong>Undamaged Capital:</strong> Having undamaged capital (cash) is crucial. It helps investors stay calm during market panics and buy the dip, just like wealthy individuals.</li>
<li><strong>The Significance of Cash:</strong> Cash is a stabilizing force that overcomes human flaws in investing (fear and greed), allowing the power of compounding to fully take effect.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> Recommends a cash allocation of at least 20% in the portfolio.</li>
<li><strong>Retirement Planning:</strong>  To withdraw $30,000 annually from an investment account after retirement, $1.5 million in cash is needed. James suggests withdrawing $50,000 annually, requiring $2.5 million in cash, approximately 20% of total assets.</li>

<li><strong>Selling Advice:</strong> Recommends selling real estate and land, investing the funds in the stock market. There&rsquo;s no real estate that can&rsquo;t be sold, only prices that are too high. Even if sold at a lower price, investment returns may quickly compensate for the difference.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1: How can I deduct the interest on a pledged loan against the interest earned on cash holdings?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>James:</strong> There&rsquo;s no deduction. If the interest earned on your cash is higher than the loan interest, you&rsquo;re effectively earning more. I recommend buying non-dividend-paying stocks in your personal account, like BOXX, to avoid paying taxes on interest income. Since you don&rsquo;t have a Roth IRA, you can only operate within a brokerage account and will incur some tax costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2: Which trading software do you recommend?</strong>
<ul>

<li><strong>Question 1: How should I handle my properties in Canada and the US?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>James:</strong> I recommend selling your Canadian property as soon as possible. If your US property is your primary residence, I also suggest selling it and renting instead. It&rsquo;s more cost-effective, as demonstrated in the rent vs. buy case study in the presentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2: What should I do with my Canadian pension plan?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>James:</strong> I recommend withdrawing the money from your pension plan and investing it in QQQ within a brokerage account. Don&rsquo;t use the 403(b) and TDA accounts provided by your school, as their performance is poor. Stick to your own IRA account.</li>

<li><strong>Comment 1: There&rsquo;s a significant wealth gap among young people, and some try to fill it by borrowing money. How can I avoid this trap?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>James:</strong> First, cultivate strong mental fortitude, which can be achieved through reading. Second, don&rsquo;t lend money casually. Third, don&rsquo;t buy things you don&rsquo;t need. Even Warren Buffett, despite his wealth, doesn&rsquo;t buy unnecessary things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Comment 2: I participated in an 11-day meditation retreat and gained insights into the relationship between meditation and investing, particularly the importance of focus.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>James:</strong> Avoid distractions outside the stock market and focus on your investment strategy.  Treat distractions like &ldquo;demons and monsters&rdquo;—don&rsquo;t listen, don&rsquo;t watch, don&rsquo;t engage—and you&rsquo;ll maintain composure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question: Does focusing solely on my own investments lead to detachment from the world?</strong>

<li><strong>Question: How should I rebalance my portfolio?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>James:</strong> Since you&rsquo;re still working, you don&rsquo;t need to engage in complex rebalancing.  Just rebalance annually, adjusting the proportions of leveraged ETFs (00670L/TQQQ/Q2D) and cash. You can leave your 00662/QQQ holdings untouched. Alternatively, during your monthly investments, maintain an 80% allocation to 00662/QQQ and 20% to 00864B/cash.  (He then provides a specific example of adjusting the ratio between 00670L and cash).</li>

You can invest in leveraged ETFs within the Roth IRA and hold cash in your traditional retirement account to lower your overall return and tax burden.  Start converting to a Roth IRA as soon as possible; don&rsquo;t wait until RMDs begin.</li>

<p>The core concept of this book is that everyone can achieve financial freedom through investment, not just the wealthy or high-income earners. Through thirteen Investment Iron Laws, it emphasizes the importance of correct financial management concepts and long-term investment, encouraging readers to start managing their finances early, invest primarily in high-return investment tools such as stocks and real estate, and hold them for the long term, ultimately achieving financial freedom through the power of compound interest. The book uses numerous real-life examples and simple language to help readers understand and master correct financial management methods, while abandoning common financial management misunderstandings, such as short-term trading and over-reliance on bank deposits.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Personal investment can lead to wealth:</strong> The author believes that personal investment is not only a means to improve financial status but also an important path to wealth. Even if the monthly investment amount is small, as long as you persevere, you can accumulate considerable wealth by relying on the power of compound interest and ultimately realize the dream of becoming a billionaire. The book illustrates the power of compound interest with the example of investing 1200 Yuan per month with an annual return of 20%, resulting in assets exceeding 100 million Yuan after 40 years. It also cites the financial stories of the Lien Chan family and a postman to prove that even ordinary office workers can accumulate huge wealth with proper financial management.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing income and reducing expenditure treats the symptoms, not the root cause:</strong> Although diligence and frugality are traditional virtues, it is difficult to achieve financial freedom solely by relying on them in the era of rapid economic development. The author believes that financial management is more important than increasing income and reducing expenditure. The core of financial management lies in &ldquo;making money with money&rdquo; by achieving higher returns through investment, thereby enabling wealth to grow exponentially. The book uses the Lien Chan family&rsquo;s financial management methods as an example to illustrate the importance of investing in stocks and real estate. It points out that the Lien family did not start with huge wealth but accumulated astonishing wealth through long-term investment and financial management.</li>
<li><strong>Financial management methods cause the wealth gap:</strong> The author believes that the main cause of the wealth gap is not external factors such as family background, personal effort, or luck, but the difference in financial concepts and methods. The rich tend to invest their assets in high-yield investment tools such as stocks and real estate, while the poor tend to deposit money in banks, resulting in a slow rate of wealth appreciation. The book uses the example of two classmates who joined the same company after graduation to illustrate how different financial management methods eventually lead to vastly different wealth outcomes.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Saving is equal to wasting resources:</strong> The author points out that keeping money in the bank seems safe but is actually a waste of resources. This is because bank deposit interest rates are low, and under the influence of inflation, the real rate of return is close to zero or even negative. This means that money deposited in the bank not only fails to appreciate but also depreciates. The book uses biblical stories and the example of the Nobel Prize Foundation to illustrate that not making good use of wealth, even without loss, is a waste.</li>
<li><strong>Deposit interest rates do not have compound interest benefits:</strong> Although bank deposits also enjoy compound interest, due to the low interest rate, the effect of compound interest is very limited and difficult to withstand the erosion of inflation. The author compares the final returns of two investment methods after 40 years, using a 5% bank interest rate and a 20% stock/real estate investment return rate as examples, illustrating the importance of the rate of return on investment.</li>
<li><strong>The invisible killer of currency value - inflation:</strong> Inflation is the &ldquo;invisible killer&rdquo; that causes money to depreciate. The author vividly illustrates the impact of inflation by comparing the price of red bean ice 30 years ago and now. He points out that in an inflationary environment, depositing money in the bank actually means &ldquo;the more you save, the less you have&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>The way to wealth of Zhang Pingsan, former chairman of Chang Hwa Bank:</strong> The author tells the story of Zhang Pingsan, the former chairman of Chang Hwa Bank, who achieved tremendous wealth growth by continuously borrowing money to buy Chang Hwa Bank shares and holding them for a long time. Those who sold their shares and put the money in the bank missed the opportunity to become wealthy. This once again proves the point that &ldquo;don&rsquo;t save money in the bank&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>The money deposited in the bank should not exceed living expenses:</strong> The author suggests that the amount of money deposited in the bank should be limited to meet two months of living expenses, and the excess should be used for investment to obtain higher returns. He also proposes a &ldquo;two large, one small&rdquo; investment portfolio suggestion: most assets are invested in stocks and real estate, and a small portion of funds is deposited in the bank for emergencies. He explains the liquidity of stocks and real estate to dispel readers&rsquo; concerns about investment liquidity.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>How Li Ka-shing accumulated wealth:</strong> The author uses Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong&rsquo;s richest man, as an example to illustrate the importance of long-term investment. Li Ka-shing accumulated huge wealth through long-term investment in real estate. Getting rich through financial management requires time and patience; it is impossible to achieve overnight success. His success was not solely based on luck or hard work; more importantly, it was due to his long-term vision and perseverance.</li>
<li><strong>It takes a long time to see the effect of compound interest in financial management:</strong> The manifestation of the compound interest effect takes time, and it is difficult to see significant results in short-term investments. The author uses the example of investing 14,000 Yuan annually with an annual return of 20% to calculate the investment returns after 10, 20, 30, and 40 years, which are 360,000 Yuan, 2.61 million Yuan, 16.55 million Yuan, and 102.81 million Yuan, respectively. This set of data clearly demonstrates the power of compound interest and the importance of waiting patiently. Financial management is more like a marathon than a sprint.</li>
<li><strong>As long as you are patient, the money won&rsquo;t run away:</strong> Wealth accumulation is a gradual process that requires patience to wait for the compound interest effect to play out. The author uses the land investment experience of Zhang Yaohongying, Chairman of Hongjing Construction, as an example to illustrate that even if the initial investment return is not obvious, as long as you persist in holding it for a long time, you can eventually get a rich return.</li>
<li><strong>Getting rich overnight is counterproductive:</strong> The author warns readers that getting rich through financial management takes time, and they should not dream of getting rich quickly. Investment opportunities that bring rapid wealth in the short term are often accompanied by extremely high risks, which may eventually lead to losing everything. The author suggests that if you want to get rich quickly, you should choose to start a business instead of resorting to speculation.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Procrastination is the main reason for financial failure:</strong> The author points out that procrastination is one of the main reasons for financial failure. As age increases, the time available for investment decreases, and the space for the compound interest effect to play out also shrinks. Therefore, financial management should start as early as possible. Do not wait until you are older to realize the importance of financial management, as it is often too late.</li>
<li><strong>Start investing from today:</strong> The earlier you start investing, the longer the time for compound interest, and the higher the final return. The author calculates the monthly investment amount required under the same target amount and investment rate of return with different starting investment ages as examples. The data shows that the later you start investing, the higher the monthly investment amount required, highlighting the importance of starting financial management early.</li>
<li><strong>Jeffrey Koo Jr. is good at making money:</strong> The author uses the example of Jeffrey Koo Jr., Vice President of CTBC Financial Holding, to illustrate that even those from wealthy families should learn financial management early. Jeffrey Koo Jr. invested his savings in the stock market during his university days and obtained substantial returns, indicating that young people can also achieve success through financial management.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t neglect financial management because of lack of money:</strong> The author emphasizes that financial management is not exclusive to the rich. Even if you don&rsquo;t have much money, you should start as early as possible and let the limited funds play the role of compound interest, accumulating little by little to eventually accumulate considerable wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Youth is the most appropriate time to take risks:</strong> When you are young, you have a lighter family burden and the cost of failure is relatively low, so it is more suitable to take certain investment risks. Moreover, young people have more time to make up for potential losses and learn from their mistakes.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Good use of debt investment:</strong> The author introduces the concept of &ldquo;financial leverage,&rdquo; which refers to using borrowed funds for investment to achieve a small investment with a large return, maximizing profits. He uses the examples of Chen Youhao, President of Eastern Multimedia Group, and Weng Daming of Hualon Group to illustrate how successful entrepreneurs use financial leverage for business expansion and investment. Specific examples are used to calculate the investment return rate under different leverage ratios to help readers understand the principle and role of financial leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Two major principles of borrowing:</strong> The author proposes two major principles for debt investment: 1. The expected return on investment must be greater than the loan interest rate; 2. In the worst case, cash income must be sufficient to pay the principal and interest of the loan. These two principles emphasize the risks of debt investment and remind readers to rationally evaluate the expected rate of return of the investment target and conduct risk assessment to ensure that even if the investment fails, the principal and interest of the loan can be repaid on time.</li>
<li><strong>Banks are not places to save money:</strong> The author points out that for people who are good at financial management, banks are not places to save money but sources of borrowing. He explains the operating model of banks: Banks absorb deposits from depositors and then lend these funds to investors. Investors make profits through investment and pay interest to banks. Therefore, people who are good at financial management can use bank funds for investment to magnify returns.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid improper debt:</strong> The author cautions readers to avoid improper debt. Do not borrow money to participate in high-risk activities such as futures, margin trading, and gambling because the expected return rate of these activities is negative, and long-term participation will inevitably lead to losses. Also, do not over-engage in consumer loans, such as credit card loans and car loans, as high-interest loans will seriously erode personal wealth. Mortgage loans are acceptable, but you should also live within your means and make sure that the monthly repayment pressure is within your affordable range.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Analyze risks and reduce harm:</strong> The author points out that risks cannot be completely avoided in the investment process. The purpose of risk management is not to eliminate risk but to analyze risk and reduce the potential harm caused by risk. He emphasizes not to over-rely on forecasting because the accuracy of forecasting is difficult to guarantee, and over-reliance on forecasting may lead investors to lose their risk awareness.</li>
<li><strong>Forbes&rsquo; philosophy of distress:</strong> The author uses the example of American billionaire Forbes to illustrate that even risk-averse people can take risks through reasonable risk management. Although Forbes doesn&rsquo;t like adventure, in order to experience the beauty of life, he will participate in some high-risk activities, such as hot air ballooning and off-road motorcycles. But he will make full preparations before taking risks and take various measures to reduce risks.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t blindly avoid risks:</strong> The author believes that in a changing environment, the biggest risk is not taking risks. In order to obtain higher returns, certain risks must be taken. Blindly avoiding risks may eventually lead to missed opportunities and even failure to achieve financial freedom.</li>
<li><strong>Overcome risks - start small:</strong> For unfamiliar investments, you should start with small investments, gradually accumulate experience, and gradually improve your risk tolerance. Just like scouts, first test the waters with a small amount to understand the situation, and then gradually increase the investment.</li>
<li><strong>There is no high-return, zero-risk investment:</strong> The author reminds readers that all high-yield investments are accompanied by high risks and not to believe in the so-called &ldquo;high-yield, risk-free&rdquo; investment scams. If someone recommends such an investment opportunity to you, it is likely that they are trying to deceive you.</li>

<li><strong>Diversify your investments and hold them for the long term:</strong> The author proposes the investment strategy of &ldquo;diversification and long-term holding&rdquo; and believes that this is the key to avoiding being trapped and obtaining long-term stable returns. Diversified investment can reduce the risk of choosing the wrong investment target; diversifying investment timing can reduce the risk of buying at market highs; long-term holding can reduce the risk brought by short-term market fluctuations and fully enjoy the benefits brought by compound interest.</li>
<li><strong>Principle of risk diversification:</strong> The principle of diversified investment is to reduce the overall risk of the investment portfolio by increasing the types of investments so that the rise and fall of different assets in the investment portfolio can offset each other. The author points out that diversification is not the more the better and that management costs need to be considered. Too many investment types will increase management difficulty and cost, which is not conducive to improving profits.</li>
<li><strong>Diversify investment timing:</strong> In order to reduce the risk of buying at market highs, the author suggests spreading the funds over different periods. He proposes two methods: one is &ldquo;invest if you have money,&rdquo; and the other is &ldquo;regularly invest a fixed amount in mutual funds.&rdquo; &ldquo;Invest if you have money&rdquo; means that once you have idle funds, invest immediately and do not try to predict market timing; &ldquo;regular investment of a fixed amount in mutual funds&rdquo; means investing a fixed amount every month to buy mutual funds. This method can effectively smooth market fluctuations and reduce investment risks.</li>
<li><strong>Methods of diversified investment:</strong> The author introduces three methods of diversified investment in detail: 1. Diversification of investment tools, such as stocks, real estate, gold, art, etc.; 2. Diversification of investment targets, for example, when investing in stocks, do not just buy one stock, but buy multiple stocks in different industries; 3. Diversification of investment regions, for example, invest some assets in overseas markets to diversify regional risks.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce the risk of choosing the wrong selling time - long-term holding:</strong> Through research on the Taiwan stock market, the author found that the longer the holding time, the lower the probability of loss. For example, the probability of loss when holding stocks for more than 5 years is only 1%, and it is almost impossible to lose money when holding for more than 10 years. This once again proves the importance of long-term holding.</li>

<li><strong>Liu Qiude&rsquo;s secret to wealth:</strong> The author uses the financial story of Liu Qiude, Vice President of Cathay Life Insurance, as an example to illustrate the power of long-term holding of high-quality stocks. Liu Qiude worked at Cathay Life Insurance from his twenties. He held his savings and the Cathay Life Insurance shares he acquired from his colleagues for a long time and eventually became a billionaire. This example also reflects the long-term and stable performance growth of Cathay Life Insurance from the side.</li>
<li><strong>Why stocks have high returns:</strong> The author explains the source of returns from stock investment: stocks represent ownership of a company, and shareholders can share in the company&rsquo;s profits and asset appreciation. Therefore, the returns from investing in stocks come from corporate earnings and asset appreciation, not from the losses of other investors. He pointed out that the long-term rise in stock prices is mainly due to the improvement of corporate profitability and the growth of asset value.</li>
<li><strong>Carefully select the types of stocks to invest in:</strong> The author compares the characteristics of listed stocks, over-the-counter stocks, unlisted stocks, and mutual funds and suggests that ordinary investors should give priority to investing in listed stocks or mutual funds. Listed stocks have good liquidity, transparent information disclosure, and relatively strict supervision, so the risks are relatively low. Mutual funds are managed by professionals and can effectively diversify investment risks, making them suitable for investors who do not have much time and energy to research stocks.</li>
<li><strong>Stock investment is better than real estate investment:</strong> The author compares stock and real estate investment from the aspects of investment threshold, taxation, and trading convenience. He believes that stock investment has a lower threshold, lighter taxes, and is more convenient to trade, making it more suitable for ordinary investors.</li>
<li><strong>Can stocks still maintain high returns in the future?:</strong> The author analyzes and forecasts the future return rate of the Taiwan stock market. He believes that although Taiwan&rsquo;s economic growth has slowed down, it is still higher than other countries and regions, so the Taiwan stock market still has high investment value in the future, but the return rate may be slightly lower than in the past.</li>

<li><strong>Buy casually, buy at any time, don&rsquo;t sell:</strong> The author once again emphasizes the investment strategy of &ldquo;buy casually, buy at any time, don&rsquo;t sell&rdquo; and points out that this is the highest level of financial management. This strategy seems simple, but it actually contains profound investment wisdom: it emphasizes long-term holding, infrequent trading, and avoiding being affected by short-term market fluctuations, thereby obtaining long-term and stable returns. The author admits that most people find it difficult to do this because they cannot overcome human weaknesses such as greed and fear.</li>
<li><strong>What to buy - buy casually:</strong> The author points out that as long as diversified investment is achieved, the selection of individual stocks is not important. He uses the experiment of &ldquo;monkeys throwing darts to select stocks&rdquo; and his own experience of selecting stocks with his children as examples to illustrate the effectiveness of &ldquo;buying casually&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>When to buy - buy at any time:</strong> The author suggests that investors &ldquo;buy if they have money&rdquo;, and do not try to predict market timing. He emphasizes &ldquo;buying and waiting for a chance to rise&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;waiting for a chance to buy&rdquo;. Because the market is difficult to predict, and time is the key factor in compound interest, the earlier you start investing, the more you can enjoy the benefits brought by compound interest.</li>
<li><strong>When to sell - don&rsquo;t sell:</strong> The author believes that long-term holding is the key to obtaining high returns. He quotes Jesse Livermore, the author of Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, and the investment strategy of Taiwan&rsquo;s richest man, Cai Wanlin, to illustrate the importance of long-term holding.</li>
<li><strong>Random walk and efficient market theory:</strong> The author introduces the &ldquo;random walk hypothesis&rdquo; and the &ldquo;efficient market hypothesis&rdquo; to provide a theoretical basis for the strategy of &ldquo;buy casually, buy at any time, don&rsquo;t sell&rdquo;. The &ldquo;random walk hypothesis&rdquo; believes that short-term fluctuations in stock prices are random and difficult to predict; the &ldquo;efficient market hypothesis&rdquo; believes that all information in the market is already reflected in stock prices, so it is futile to predict market trends by analyzing information.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Blind spots in prediction and analysis:</strong> The author once again emphasizes the limitations of prediction and analysis. He points out that technical analysis and market forecasting cannot guarantee investment success, and may even lead to losses due to frequent trading. Technical analysis is based on historical data, but the market environment is constantly changing, and past performance does not represent future trends.</li>
<li><strong>The only thing that can be measured is the unmeasurable:</strong> Market trends are difficult to predict. Instead of trying to predict the market, it is better to formulate a reasonable investment strategy and hold it for a long time. The author illustrates the unreliability of prediction with an example of a failed stock market prophet.</li>
<li><strong>Believe in yourself rather than experts:</strong> The author advises investors not to over-rely on expert opinions and to cultivate their own financial management capabilities and independent judgment. He pointed out that expert opinions often contradict each other, and ten experts may have eleven opinions. Besides, experts may also be influenced by various factors, such as conflicts of interest, and thus give biased opinions.</li>

<li><strong>Value strategy:</strong> The core of value strategy is &ldquo;buy when the value is higher than the price, and sell when the value is lower than the price&rdquo;. The author uses the huge difference in the share price of China Development Financial at different times as an example to illustrate the impact of market sentiment on stock prices and the performance of investors&rsquo; irrational behavior. He advises investors to learn rational consumption behavior and buy stocks when the &ldquo;price is discounted&rdquo;. He also points out that the key to value investing is being able to accurately assess the intrinsic value of a company, which requires certain professional knowledge and experience.</li>
<li><strong>Growth strategy:</strong> The core of the growth strategy is to invest in companies with high growth potential in the future and hold them for the long term. The author uses Peter Lynch&rsquo;s investment strategy and the investment story of the &ldquo;Coca-Cola Grandma&rdquo; as examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the growth strategy. He advises investors to choose companies with high growth potential in the next 5-10 years and focus on choosing the right industry because the growth of the industry will drive the growth of corporate performance.</li>
<li><strong>Contrarian strategy:</strong> The core of the contrarian strategy is &ldquo;invest when most people are not investing, and sell when most people are eager to invest&rdquo;. The author uses the business philosophy of Fan Li and the investment strategy of Zheng Zhoumin as examples to illustrate the principle of contrarian operation. He pointed out that market sentiment is often wrong. When the market is excessively pessimistic, it is often a good time to buy; when the market is excessively optimistic, it is often a good time to sell. However, contrarian operation is very difficult, and it requires investors to have independent thinking ability and strong psychological quality.</li>
<li><strong>Value, growth, and contrarian strategies are suitable for experts:</strong> The author summarizes the characteristics of the three strategies and points out that these strategies are more suitable for professional investors. For ordinary investors, the strategy of &ldquo;buy casually, buy at any time, don&rsquo;t sell&rdquo; is simpler and easier to implement, and it is also easier to obtain long-term and stable returns.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Buy low and sell high is full of crises:</strong> The author pointed out that &ldquo;buying low and selling high&rdquo; seems to be the secret to making money from stock investment, but it is actually full of traps. Because no one can accurately predict the short-term fluctuations of the market, trying to make profits through &ldquo;buying low and selling high&rdquo; will often fall into the dilemma of chasing ups and downs, which will eventually lead to losses. He emphasizes that the main source of stock investment income is corporate profits and dividends, not the difference in buying and selling prices.</li>
<li><strong>Short-term operation is gambling:</strong> The author believes that the essence of short-term operation is speculation and gambling, and it is difficult to make a profit in the long run. Because short-term operations require frequent trading, and each transaction will generate transaction costs, such as commissions, stamp duty, etc. These transaction costs will eat away at investment income, and accumulate over time, will have a significant negative impact on investment returns.</li>
<li><strong>A game with no chance of winning:</strong> The author analyzes the composition of the stock market, including intermediaries (securities companies, governments, etc.), major shareholders, major players, and retail investors. He pointed out that retail investors are at a clear disadvantage in this game of short-term operations because they lack the advantages of capital, information, and resources. Therefore, retail investors should avoid participating in short-term operations and adopt a long-term investment strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Never participate in futures and margin trading:</strong> The author strongly recommends that investors not participate in futures and margin trading because these transactions are extremely risky, and the leverage effect will magnify both profits and losses. It is difficult for ordinary investors to control the risks. He uses the example of the Barings Bank collapse to illustrate the huge risks of futures and margin trading.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>What influences a person&rsquo;s future wealth the most,
is whether they have started managing their finances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Everyone Can Achieve Wealth Through Personal Finance</strong></p>
<p>This book aims to illustrate a simple truth: investing and managing your finances can not only improve the financial situation of an individual or family, but is also an excellent path to wealth creation.  Furthermore, anyone can achieve wealth through personal finance. You don&rsquo;t need to be rich, have a high income, possess a high degree, have specialized knowledge or advanced skills, nor rely on luck. What you need is the desire for wealth, a correct investment philosophy (not just techniques), and the patience to wait for the long term.  Therefore, whether a person has money or not, or how high their income is, doesn&rsquo;t matter. What truly influences a person&rsquo;s future wealth is whether they have started managing their finances. This endeavor is not easy, but it&rsquo;s undoubtedly worth your effort!</p>
<p>Readers, please immediately review your current asset allocation. Is too much of your capital sitting in bank accounts or other &ldquo;guaranteed return&rdquo; investments?  Is your investment portfolio sufficiently diversified? Do you frequently buy and sell in the stock market?</p>
<p>After understanding your asset allocation, you should earnestly plan your financial goals and follow these five principles:</p>
<p><em>1. Clearly define the amount of wealth you hope to achieve and keep it in mind at all times. Simply thinking &ldquo;I want to be rich&rdquo; is not enough.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Set a specific date for achieving your goal.</em></p>
<p><em>3. Determine what price you&rsquo;re willing to pay and what actions you&rsquo;ll take to reach your ideal goal.</em></p>
<p><em>4. Think about your goal at least twice a day to reinforce your belief.</em></p>
<p><em>5.  Take action, whether you feel completely ready or not.</em></p>
<p>In Appendix II, readers can use the wealth creation formula and examples provided to calculate how to achieve their financial goals.</p>
<p>Your future wealth depends on what you do today. Don&rsquo;t let unnecessary hesitation cast a shadow on your heart. As long as you understand investment and financial management, you too can become wealthy in the future. Everyone possesses the necessary ingredients for wealth creation: a small amount of capital and a God-given resource—time. As long as you are willing to learn about personal finance, you have the potential to become a multi-millionaire.</p>
<p>When you find people around you feeling lost due to a lack of vision for the future, share with them the &ldquo;¥14,000 a year for 40 years can make you a multi-millionaire&rdquo; formula and help them reignite their hope.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Dependence Is Your Own Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>The unequal distribution of wealth in today&rsquo;s society is increasingly severe. Some blame flawed policies, others point to artificial market manipulation. I believe neither is the primary cause.  One of the main reasons for the wealth gap is the disparity in financial literacy among people.</p>
<p>The reason for poverty in modern times is not so much insufficient income, lack of thrift, or excessive spending, but rather improper financial management. In modern society, achieving financial independence after the age of 40 is a fundamental responsibility for everyone. Whether you want to or not, or whether you like it or not, investment and financial management have become essential knowledge for modern individuals. Remember, with our current income levels and investment opportunities, &ldquo;remaining poor after 40&rdquo; is self-inflicted, and &ldquo;not being a multi-millionaire after 70&rdquo; is due to a lack of financial knowledge.</p>
<p>Advances in modern medicine have increased human life expectancy, leading to an aging society.  Longer lifespans are a blessing, but enjoying a comfortable retirement is even more crucial. We must accumulate sufficient wealth to secure our lives in old age.</p>
<p><strong>Effortless Personal Finance, Enjoy the Process</strong></p>
<p>From the examples provided in this article, we can see that those who are good at managing their finances understand how to invest their assets in stocks and real estate with high long-term returns, and they avoid unnecessary short-term trading, thus achieving wealth with ease.  Those who are not good at managing their finances either focus solely on saving and keeping their assets in &ldquo;safe&rdquo; bank deposits or try to get rich quickly by engaging in short-term trading in the stock or futures markets. These individuals will eventually be left far behind in the race for financial success.</p>
<p>Most people keep their assets in financial institutions without investing them, and when they do start investing, they aim for quick riches.  As a result, their money stagnates in banks, and their pursuit of quick wealth often leads to substantial losses.  They fail to realize that with a little courage, by investing in stocks and real estate and patiently waiting for decades, they can naturally achieve wealth.</p>
<p>Simply put, building wealth through personal finance only requires two things: investing your capital in areas with high returns and having the patience to wait for the long term. The required investment is low, the probability of success is high, and the process is relaxed and enjoyable.</p>
<p>I advise readers not to rush to get rich through investment, causing anxiety and ultimately achieving the opposite of what they desire.  By following the methods described in this book, you can achieve financial success without expending excessive time and energy, allowing you to focus on your existing career.</p>
<p>Personal finance is a marathon, not a sprint. If you view the entire process from a long-term perspective, temporary setbacks don&rsquo;t signify failure, and momentary gains don&rsquo;t guarantee lasting success. With this mindset, you can maintain a more open perspective and avoid becoming overly attached to gains and losses.</p>
<p>I admit that consistently buying assets and holding them long-term can make personal finance seem dull and unbearable. However, before engaging in any financial activities, investors must clarify their objectives: is it to build wealth or to seek the thrill of gambling? Personal finance can not only lead to wealth but also bring joy and knowledge.  Everyone should learn how to manage their finances and find enjoyment in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t Feel Guilty About Being Wealthy</strong></p>
<p>Wealth should be acquired and used ethically. You don&rsquo;t need to apologize to others for your wealth. Only the pursuit of wealth through unscrupulous means is sinful and unfortunate.  Therefore, everyone should not only be confident but also feel obligated to earn wealth. There&rsquo;s no need to be secretive or ashamed about pursuing wealth. On the contrary, being financially dependent is a burden on society.  Moreover, wealthy individuals are more capable of contributing to society.  In short, if you can&rsquo;t find a good reason why getting rich is bad, why not allow yourself to become wealthy?</p>
<p>You earning more in the investment market doesn&rsquo;t mean others will earn less or lose more.  If everyone is proficient in managing their finances, not only can individuals prosper, but economic resources can also be utilized effectively, leading to rapid overall economic growth.  In a market economy, the wealth of society is built upon the wealth of its people. Only a prosperous populace can create a prosperous economy.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s financially driven world, whether for personal advancement or the benefit of society as a whole, everyone should strengthen their understanding of personal finance. When everyone is skilled in managing their finances, individuals and families can live prosperous lives, the wealth gap can be narrowed, and the nation can progress and flourish.</p>
<p><strong>Action Speaks Louder Than Words</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowing and not doing is not knowing.&rdquo; The biggest obstacle to personal finance is not that it&rsquo;s difficult to do, but that it&rsquo;s difficult to start.  The key to overcoming this is to act immediately.  One of the main reasons for failure in personal finance is avoiding decisions.  However, if you want to achieve your goal of building wealth through investment, there&rsquo;s no other way than to take action.</p>
<p>After reading the basic principles of investment and financial management outlined in this article, you should understand that building wealth is not only achievable but also not difficult.  So, act now! Time is money. The earlier you start, the sooner you&rsquo;ll reach your financial goals and share the fruits of your labor with your family.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, changes in society, politics, economics, and finance will accelerate, and the resulting redistribution of wealth will inevitably follow suit.  For yourself, your family, and society as a whole, managing your finances is a role everyone should embrace.</p>
<p><strong>Persistence Is Key</strong></p>
<p>For readers seeking quick riches, this book might disappoint you.  A more accurate title would be: &ldquo;How to Invest and Manage Your Finances to Slowly but Steadily Build Wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many believe that successful people are infallible—never failing, never experiencing losses.  Many also think they must be omniscient and possess sufficient knowledge before they can start investing and managing their finances.  Our most common flaw is our unwillingness to try repeatedly and to persevere. Building wealth through personal finance is not difficult! The reason most people don&rsquo;t achieve their goals is their inability to persevere and their lack of patience.</p>
<p>Persistence is essential for success in personal finance. Suppose you embark on a wealth-building plan and encounter setbacks along the way. Don&rsquo;t be discouraged. Some people regularly save and invest annually.  When prices rise, they are satisfied and continue their plan. But when prices fall, they panic and abandon their investment strategy.  They fail to understand that price fluctuations are inherent in the investment market, and investment results will inevitably fluctuate.</p>
<p>If, midway through your financial plan, you succumb to the temptation to spend your investment capital or give up due to repeated setbacks, all your previous efforts will be wasted.  <strong>Success in personal finance depends on endurance and resolve:  endurance to delay gratification and resist immediate consumption temptations; and resolve to withstand significant wealth fluctuations over long periods without losing your composure.  As long as you have perseverance and resolve, trust in compound interest, and believe in the &ldquo;wealth creation formula,&rdquo; the ultimate wealth will undoubtedly be yours.</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;No dreams, no wealth.&rdquo;  Those who build wealth through personal finance must be driven by desire and ambition.  They also need sufficient courage, knowledge, patience, and perseverance.  A lack of courage, flawed methods, impatience, or giving up halfway will not work. Whether you can achieve wealth and financial independence in the future depends entirely on your actions and efforts today.</p>
<p><strong>Unlock Your Hidden Wealth Potential</strong></p>
<p>Believe it or not, the price of living a wealthy and successful life is no greater than the price of living a poor and miserable one. Achieving this depends entirely on wisdom, belief, and action. After reading this book, readers should understand that everyone can achieve wealth through personal finance. The reason most people are not wealthy is not due to low income, but rather a lack of understanding of how to create wealth through investment and financial management. The primary purpose of this book is to help everyone unlock their hidden wealth potential.</p>
<p>If, after reading this book, you still cannot effectively apply these investment principles to manage your money and improve your financial situation, then this book is a complete failure.  Financial education is not merely about imparting knowledge; its significance lies in genuinely changing the reader&rsquo;s financial behavior.</p>
<p>This is a book of action, not a textbook for enhancing investment knowledge or a &ldquo;decorative book&rdquo; for your bookshelf.  This book aims to inspire readers to change their mindset and behavior. Its success depends on readers taking action based on the core principles presented, breaking free from mediocrity, and embarking on the path to wealth. Therefore, at the end of most chapters, key points are summarized for readers to reflect upon and apply.</p>
<p>Investment and financial management can not only lead to wealth but also bring joy to investors. Everyone should learn how to manage their finances and reap the substantial rewards.  I believe most readers already possess the basic requirements for building wealth: a small amount of capital, sufficient time, and the investment knowledge gained from this book.  The world of personal finance, full of changes and opportunities, awaits you.  It is filled with treasures and pitfalls. Don&rsquo;t hesitate, and don&rsquo;t leave empty-handed.</p>
<p>The principles of building wealth through investment and financial management are neither profound nor mysterious. They are absolutely achievable for everyone, and many have indeed easily become wealthy through these methods.  As we&rsquo;ve mentioned before, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re willing to learn, managing your finances is as simple as walking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the financial principles presented in this book, you&rsquo;ll find many that contradict deeply ingrained investment concepts and financial habits, and some even go against human nature.  Therefore, to realize the ideal of wealth creation through investment and financial management, the first step is to break free from some &ldquo;deep-rooted and misguided&rdquo; investment concepts, common knowledge, and habits.  Almost none of these concepts and principles are easy to achieve. Therefore, I advise readers to not only read each chapter carefully but also to review, reflect, establish strict rules, and ultimately change their behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Wealth Is a Means to a Better Life</strong></p>
<p>Finally, this book must emphasize that <strong>wealth is not the purpose of life, but a means to create a better life.</strong>  The ultimate goal of investment and financial management is not just to become rich, but to use wealth to realize your life&rsquo;s aspirations.  Therefore, <strong>a fulfilling and balanced life is the starting point for personal finance.</strong></p>
<p>Everyone should actively and optimistically plan and execute their lifelong financial journey.  Based on the principles we&rsquo;ve presented, everyone can achieve substantial wealth through personal finance without sacrificing time, energy, work, or life.  However, it&rsquo;s crucial to remember that <strong>only those who balance career, life, health, family, and wealth can be considered truly successful in managing their finances.</strong>  Those who gain the world&rsquo;s riches but lose their health, family, and the meaning of life cannot be considered truly successful.  In today&rsquo;s society, many are lost in the pursuit of wealth, sacrificing more valuable things in life.  Therefore, this principle of balancing personal finance and life is particularly important and deserves careful consideration.</p>
<p>Although this book repeatedly emphasizes that success in personal finance depends on mindset, time, and action, not luck, I still congratulate you, the reader, on being fortunate enough to encounter this book. By adhering to the investment principles within, you are sure to become a multi-millionaire in the decades to come!</p>
