<p>The core theme of this session is the <strong>evolution of investors</strong>. Teacher James compares investors to biological organisms, proposing that they need to evolve from &ldquo;single-celled lower animals,&rdquo; easily eliminated by market fluctuations, into &ldquo;higher animals&rdquo; capable of withstanding any market environment. This evolution is achieved by learning the correct investment philosophy and risk management. The key to this transformation is a firm belief that the market will rise in the long term, adopting a &ldquo;buy, hold, never sell&rdquo; strategy, and establishing an asset allocation that can withstand extreme risks (such as a market drop of 80% lasting for 10 years).</p>

<li><strong>Belief is Paramount</strong>: The market has no peak; it only goes higher. It won&rsquo;t hit a ceiling; it will only rise ceaselessly. Investors should ignore external analysis and short-term market turmoil because no analysis can beat the power of &ldquo;holding shares and doing nothing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>The Ultimate Strategy</strong>: The simplest strategy is the most effective—buy, hold, and never sell. As long as you do this, you will become wealthy.</li>
<li><strong>Future Outlook</strong>: QQQ is now near 600, will soon reach 1000, and in the future, we will see 6,000, and even 60,000. Human progress is limitless, and the market&rsquo;s growth has no ceiling.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Extinction of Lower Animals</strong>: The vast majority of investors in the market are &ldquo;single-celled&rdquo; or &ldquo;lower animals.&rdquo; They have not been tempered by the harsh market environment and lack the ability to cope with extreme risks. Therefore, in every financial crisis (such as the 1996 Asian Financial Crisis, the 2000 Dot-com Bubble, and the 2008 Subprime Mortgage Crisis), these &ldquo;species&rdquo; are wiped out in batches.</li>
<li><strong>Survival Principles of Higher Animals</strong>: Becoming a &ldquo;higher animal&rdquo; means possessing an investment system that has been tested over the long term and is capable of evolving. The core lies in truly understanding risk and building an asset allocation that can withstand the worst-case scenario (a market drop of 80% lasting for 10 years).</li>
<li><strong>CLEC&rsquo;s Positioning</strong>: The philosophy and system of our channel are a &ldquo;higher animal&rdquo; system, tested and evolved over 40 years in the market. We directly elevate our students to the highest level of investing, allowing them to avoid the fate of &ldquo;slaughter&rdquo; and &ldquo;extinction&rdquo; at the bottom of the market. We are not engaging in a brutal &ldquo;Normandy Landing&rdquo; battle; instead, we are &ldquo;taking the elevator&rdquo; directly to the Mount Everest of wealth.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) vs. Reverse Mortgage</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>HELOC</strong>: Suitable for young people with stable jobs. It poses a risk for retirees without a steady income, as the bank may require principal and interest payments after a few years. If the market is down at that time, it will create immense cash flow pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Mortgage</strong>: More suitable for older individuals without a stable salary. It converts real estate into a steady monthly cash flow, significantly enhancing the security of retirement life. This money can be used for living expenses or reinvested, making it an effective way to activate property assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advantages and Red Lines of Securities-Based Lending (Pledging Stocks)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage</strong>: The process is convenient and can be done with a few clicks, without needing the bank&rsquo;s approval.</li>
<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: Strict risk control and asset allocation are mandatory. The amount you can borrow is linked to your cash ratio:
<ul>
<li><strong>30% Cash</strong>: Can use <strong>2%-3%</strong> of assets annually.</li>
<li><strong>40% Cash</strong>: Can use <strong>3%-4%</strong> of assets annually.</li>
<li><strong>50% Cash</strong>: Can use <strong>4%-5%</strong> of assets annually.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Serious Warning (for U.S. Investors)</strong>: In the United States, it is <strong>absolutely forbidden</strong> to reinvest money borrowed from a securities-based loan back into a securities account. This is a serious violation. If discovered, the lending privileges may be revoked, and immediate repayment may be demanded, leading to a financial catastrophe. Regulations in Taiwan permit reinvestment, but it is strictly prohibited in the U.S.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Principles for Using Credit Loans</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Short-term credit loans should be repaid with a stable salary to ensure healthy cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of the &ldquo;High Dividends Covering Loan Interest&rdquo; Trap</strong>: Many experts advocate taking out loans to buy high-dividend products. While the dividend yield (e.g., 7%) may seem higher than the loan interest rate (e.g., 3%), they ignore that repayment requires both &ldquo;principal and interest.&rdquo; The dividend alone cannot cover the monthly payment, which can easily lead to a cash flow crisis.</li>
<li><strong>Example of Flexible Use</strong>: For instance, if you need $100,000 to buy a car, you could apply for a credit loan of $800,000. Use $100,000 for the car payment and invest the remaining $700,000. Later, you can use a securities-based loan from your investment portfolio, borrowing 2% annually to help repay the car loan, thus achieving more efficient use of your assets.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Divide Between the Rich and the Poor</strong>: A key factor distinguishing the two is whether they have been taught the correct concepts of financial management. Wealth is a &ldquo;natural gift&rdquo; that everyone can possess.</li>
<li><strong>The Essence of Investing</strong>: Investing is not a field where more diligent research leads to better performance. The key is having the right direction and a deep understanding, after which it becomes &ldquo;autopilot.&rdquo; 99.99% of external information is not worth listening to.</li>
<li><strong>The Prerequisite for Wealth</strong>: You must invest your assets in high-return targets. This is why we choose QQQ, not SPY or VT, because the latter&rsquo;s returns will make you relatively &ldquo;poorer.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>CLEC&rsquo;s Mission</strong>: If the government wants to narrow the wealth gap, it should instill the correct financial management concepts in the public. This is precisely what CLEC is doing. We are committed to financial investment education as our social mission.</li>

<li>Sharing: I found at today&rsquo;s seminar that the biggest problem for most people is that they &ldquo;can&rsquo;t hold on.&rdquo; This might be due to being stuck by certain &ldquo;limiting beliefs.&rdquo; I suggest that when you are still a &ldquo;seedling,&rdquo; you should not discuss our philosophy with outsiders who don&rsquo;t understand it. They will only tell you to &ldquo;take profits&rdquo; or &ldquo;stop loss.&rdquo; Regardless of whether the market goes up or down, the external environment is not conducive to long-term holding. If you have questions, you should come back and ask the teacher or the &ldquo;higher animals&rdquo; in the community.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Absolutely correct. We are the &ldquo;higher animals&rdquo; of investing. Isn&rsquo;t it ridiculous for a higher animal to ask a lower animal for a prescription? It&rsquo;s like a Rolls-Royce owner asking a financial advisor who rides a motorcycle or takes the bus for financial advice. Your circle determines your cognition. If you have questions, you must come back and ask those who have already made big money in this market.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: I am very excited that my family (son, daughter-in-law) and I have all joined the CLEC family. I believe it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;treasure trove&rdquo;—the more people who join, the more treasure there is, rather than a cake that gets smaller as it&rsquo;s divided.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: I reviewed the videos where the teacher talked about &ldquo;risk management&rdquo; and &ldquo;the person hiding in the cave&rdquo; (session 00523). I think they are incredibly valuable and have listened to them many times. I&rsquo;ve realized that to become truly wealthy, one needs to experience several bear markets to achieve a state of inner calm.</li>
<li>Sharing 3: Regarding the teacher&rsquo;s comment that &ldquo;whether you leave 20% or 30% cash in the end is not important,&rdquo; my understanding is that it depends on the size of one&rsquo;s total assets. For someone with assets of 1 billion, leaving 5% cash might be enough to live on for 20 years.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your understanding of the cash ratio is correct. The core idea is to calculate how many years your remaining cash can support your lifestyle; we typically use 10-15 years as a benchmark. For example, with 30% cash, if you use 2% per year, it will last 15 years; if you use 3% per year, it will last 10 years. The teacher also praised Bruce&rsquo;s proactive learning attitude, believing he will definitely succeed.</li>

<li>Questions (Canadian Investor):
<ol>
<li>In my IBKR account, is it correct to directly buy HXQ (the Canadian version of QQQ) in Canadian dollars as my core fund?</li>
<li>For the cash portion, I want to buy a non-dividend-paying Money Market fund. I could only find HSAV to buy with Canadian dollars, but its price fluctuates, which I don&rsquo;t quite understand. Should I convert to USD and buy BOXX instead?</li>
<li>Someone reminded me that Canadians holding U.S. assets face estate tax issues. What are your thoughts on this?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>Buying HXQ with Canadian dollars is correct.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s recommended to convert most of your cash (e.g., 25% of total assets) to USD and buy BOXX, as it has a higher interest rate and is non-dividend-paying, which avoids tax complications. At the same time, keep a small portion (e.g., 5%) of Canadian dollar cash in a Canadian money market fund for emergencies.</li>
<li>Estate tax is a valid concern, but it can be effectively managed by opening a &ldquo;Joint Account.&rdquo; Since you have already opened a joint account with your husband, you don&rsquo;t need to worry too much about this issue. For leveraged funds, Canada&rsquo;s QQU and TQQQ.TO are also usable options.</li>

<li>Sharing: I&rsquo;m 34 years old. After my assets reached 10 million TWD last year, I went all-in on 00662. I&rsquo;ve been through two downturns but my conviction is stronger, and I haven&rsquo;t sold a single share. He pointed out that many people in Taiwan are superstitious about 0050, but in reality, nearly 60% of 0050 is TSMC, making it highly concentrated in risk, far more so than QQQ. The entire market cap of the Taiwan stock market is less than that of Apple alone.</li>
<li>Question: I&rsquo;m concerned about the risk of war across the Taiwan Strait. I&rsquo;ve researched and found that historically, even in cases of defeat or occupation, the occupying force usually recognizes the stock assets of the citizens. Is this understanding correct?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your understanding is correct, but more importantly, the 00662 (QQQ) we invest in is a U.S. asset, holding the top 100 companies in the United States. Even if local assets in Taiwan are damaged, our U.S. dollar assets are safe. Therefore, it&rsquo;s more important to be prepared for personal safety (e.g., ensuring your passport is valid). From another perspective, when Taiwanese people invest in U.S. assets, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo; act because it helps to activate Taiwan&rsquo;s vast foreign exchange reserves, creating greater value for the entire society.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You should max it out, including the Roth 401K. For investment choices, you should select Large-Cap Growth funds, not Mid-Cap Growth, because the former performs better in the long run.</li>

<p>This session was a deep dive into the evolution of investment philosophy. Through the vivid &ldquo;animal evolution&rdquo; metaphor, Teacher James clearly analyzed the fundamental difference between successful and unsuccessful investors. It&rsquo;s not about how sophisticated their techniques are, but whether they can build a powerful system that can withstand extreme risks and endure through time cycles. The core strategy remains the beautifully simple &ldquo;buy and hold&rdquo; of a quality index fund (QQQ). At the same time, the course provided very practical guidance on asset activation and warned of the associated risks. Ultimately, investing is not just about accumulating wealth, but about gaining freedom of the mind to face life with composure and realize one&rsquo;s true value.</p>

<p>The core of this session is the mindset and strategy investors should adopt in an ever-innovating market. Teacher James emphasizes that the market&rsquo;s long-term trend is upward, and one should enter as early as possible and hold on. At the same time, he deeply analyzes two common yet high-risk assets: real estate and leveraged funds. He argues that real estate is not a good investment and carries extremely high risk. As for leveraged funds, while their short-term returns are tempting, their violent fluctuations can lead to a total loss of investment. Therefore, it is essential to control risk and lock in profits through &ldquo;smart rebalancing.&rdquo; Ultimately, only index funds are quality assets that can be passed down through generations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James once again recommended &ldquo;The Bible of Wealth Management,&rdquo; published in 1996, believing its philosophy is still highly relevant today and is a national treasure of a book.</li>
<li><strong>Core Philosophy</strong>: &ldquo;Buy anytime, buy casually, don&rsquo;t sell.&rdquo; This strategy, similar to buying and holding the entire market, aligns perfectly with the philosophy of index funds.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Compounding</strong>: The book gives an example: investing just 1200 yuan a month at a 20% rate of return can grow to 100 million in 40 years. This demonstrates the astonishing power of long-term investment; the key to wealth is investing, not saving or having a high income.</li>
<li><strong>The Root of Wealth Inequality</strong>: The book also mentions that wealth inequality stems from a lack of financial education, which aligns closely with the mission of this channel. If you don&rsquo;t have enough funds to retire at 65, the problem lies in your personal investment failures, not society.</li>

<ul>
<li>The teacher clearly states that from a return on investment perspective, a house is not a good investment and is extremely risky.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Risk</strong>: A 30-to-40-year mortgage is like a chain. If you face a crisis like mid-life unemployment, you risk foreclosure. Without a mortgage, this worry doesn&rsquo;t exist.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Risk</strong>: Natural disasters like earthquakes and fires are frequent. Even with insurance, the process of rebuilding and relocating is filled with pain and inconvenience, like carrying a &ldquo;powder keg.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Judgment Standard</strong>: The teacher offers a vivid analogy: <strong>&ldquo;You should only buy your first house when you have the ability to buy two.&rdquo;</strong> Buying a house should be like buying slippers—if they break, you can easily get a new pair. Only then is it not a risk.</li>
<li><strong>The Correct Path</strong>: First, work hard on investing to become wealthy. When your wealth reaches a certain level (e.g., 100 million, 500 million), then use borrowed funds (e.g., borrow 20 million, 100 million) to easily buy a house, achieving a &ldquo;no-money-down&rdquo; acquisition.</li>
<li><strong>Index Funds are the True &ldquo;Real Estate&rdquo;</strong>: Compared to physical property that depreciates and has holding costs (like management fees, property taxes), only index funds are quality assets that can last for a century, be passed down through generations, and become more stable over time.</li>

<ul>
<li>The teacher referenced a chart from the &ldquo;JSON Model Lab&rdquo; channel to show the extreme risk of TQQQ (3x leveraged QQQ).</li>
<li><strong>Historical Simulation</strong>: The simulation shows that one dollar invested in TQQQ in 1985 would have grown to $3,510 at the peak of the 2000 dot-com bubble, but then crashed to $1.13 in the subsequent bear market, a staggering drop of 99.96%, nearly wiping it out.</li>
<li><strong>The Trap of Long-Term Returns</strong>: Over the long period from 1985 to the present, due to decay from market volatility, TQQQ (18.28% annualized) performed worse than the 2x leveraged QLD (19.39% annualized).</li>
<li><strong>The Long Recovery Period</strong>: After the 2000 crash, QQQ reached a new high around 2014, and QLD broke even around 2022. However, if you held only TQQQ, it could take over 22 years to recover your losses, which would be devastating to any retirement plan.</li>
<li><strong>The Only Solution for Risk Control: Smart Rebalancing</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: To prevent TQQQ from dropping over 99% from its peak, which would wipe out a lifetime of investment.</li>
<li><strong>Method</strong>: At the end of the year or the beginning of the next, transfer one-third of this year&rsquo;s profits from the leveraged fund to a cash position to lock in profits and reduce risk.</li>
<li><strong>Warning</strong>: The decline of a leveraged fund is instantaneous; it might go to zero before you have a chance to rebalance. Therefore, the amount invested must be money you can afford to lose completely. The teacher does not recommend leveraged funds for beginners or those unfamiliar with their characteristics. A 70/30 (QQQ/cash) allocation is relatively stable.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pledged Asset Line (PAL) Fund Flow Warning</strong>: For investors at Charles Schwab in the US, the teacher warned that their software is now very intelligent and can track the flow of funds borrowed through a PAL. Even after multiple transfers, if the funds eventually end up in a brokerage account and are used to buy stocks, the system will detect it. You might receive a warning the first time, and subsequently, your PAL privileges could be revoked. Be careful to avoid such operations.</li>
<li><strong>View on Financial Professionals</strong>: The teacher pointedly noted that the experts and financial professionals who talk loudly in the market mostly fall into two categories:
<ol>
<li><strong>Ignorant</strong>: &ldquo;Demons and monsters&rdquo; who don&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: How to distinguish between necessary expenses and deferrable pleasures? For example, how to decide whether to buy a car or travel abroad? Is there a metric to avoid impacting future wealth through overspending?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a great question that can be solved with planning.
<ol>
<li><strong>Set a Goal</strong>: First, clarify your retirement goal, for instance, how much money you want in 20 years (e.g., 60 million).</li>
<li><strong>Calculate Required Investment</strong>: Use an investment calculator. Based on your current assets and expected rate of return (e.g., 14%), calculate how much you need to invest each month to reach your goal.</li>
<li><strong>Spend Freely</strong>: After deducting the required monthly investment from the money you can save, the remainder can be freely spent, used for travel, or put into a travel fund.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Adjustment</strong>: This calculation is dynamic. For example, if you have 10 million now and your goal is 60 million in 20 years, the calculator might show that you can even spend 66,000 per month and still reach your goal.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Don&rsquo;t save all your money; learn to spend it. You should start planning your consumption from a young age. As long as your retirement plan is not affected, you should enjoy life. Otherwise, earning a lot of money becomes meaningless. The teacher added that if you are going to spend, the memories from travel are eternal—a form of spiritual consumption more valuable than material goods that depreciate.</li>

<li>Sharing: After listening to the teacher&rsquo;s classes for three months, she cleared out over a dozen miscellaneous stocks in her Canadian Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) and switched everything to TQQQ and QLD. She convinced her husband they could retire because their assets were sufficient. She is now allocating cash and QQQ in her taxable account (IBKR).</li>
<li>Question: In the future, with new TFSA contribution room each year (e.g., C$7,000 per person) and new funds coming in monthly, how should she invest? Should she buy according to the target allocation (e.g., 40% QQQ, 35% cash, 15% TQQQ), prioritize building up the cash position, or decide based on the beta value at the time?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Account Separation</strong>: Leveraged funds (TQQQ/QLD) should be in the tax-free account (TFSA); QQQ and cash should be in the taxable account (IBKR).</li>
<li><strong>Tax-Free Account</strong>: When new contribution room is available, just buy more leveraged funds. Only rebalance if the leveraged funds become an excessively large portion of your total assets.</li>
<li><strong>Taxable Account</strong>: For new monthly funds, you can simplify the process. For example, in a year with 12 months, you could designate that the savings from 4 of those months go directly to cash, and the savings from the other 8 months are used to buy QQQ. This ensures the cash position grows, and you can review and do a major rebalancing at the end of the year.</li>

<li>Sharing: Responding to the previous student&rsquo;s question about consumption, he used to be someone who saved fanatically and was afraid to spend. After listening to the teacher, he understood that if you want to buy a car, for example, you can do so as long as you ensure you still have an equivalent amount of money to continue investing in QQQ. Between memories and material things, one should invest more in creating memories (like travel).</li>
<li>Question: He received an email and a call from QQQ about a special meeting to vote on changing the fund structure from a &ldquo;Unit Investment Trust (UIT)&rdquo; to an &ldquo;Open-End Fund.&rdquo; He wanted to ask for the teacher&rsquo;s opinion on this.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a normal and positive change. The vast majority of ETFs today (like QQQM) are already open-end funds. This change allows the fund to have its own board of directors for management, freeing it from bank trusteeship, which can lower fees and increase management flexibility. My personal recommendation is to vote &ldquo;approve.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Sharing: A client of his, a cardiologist from a wealthy family, was outbid for a luxury mansion by a woman. This woman offered a higher price and had 150 million USD in cash in her bank account, wealth that came entirely from early investments in stocks like Nvidia. This story illustrates that the wealth created by successful equity investing can easily surpass the accumulation of several generations of elite professionals.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: This is very normal. For someone who understands investing, 100 million USD is the minimum threshold. Your professional income doesn&rsquo;t determine your ultimate wealth; only long-term, stable financial investment is the key to riches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: Why was the market reaction negative when the US government initially proposed to exchange subsidies for equity in companies like TSMC, but the stock price rose after the company refused? Aren&rsquo;t government subsidies the people&rsquo;s money? What&rsquo;s wrong with letting the government (the people) share in the profits?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You have to look at this from the perspective of shareholder interests.
<ol>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s Bad for Companies Not Lacking Cash</strong>: For a company with ample cash flow like TSMC, it doesn&rsquo;t need the money. Accepting government funds and issuing new shares to the government would dilute the equity of existing shareholders, which is detrimental to them. If the government wants to own TSMC stock, it should buy it on the open market, not ask the company to print shares for it.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s Good for Companies on the Brink of Bankruptcy</strong>: However, for companies in financial crisis like Ford and General Motors (GM) at the time, they desperately needed funds to survive, so they were willing to accept the government&rsquo;s terms for taking an equity stake. This was a bailout, not a normal business investment.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A healthy company has no reason to sacrifice shareholder interests to take government money.</li>

<li>Question 1: The teacher says pledged loans should not exceed 20% of total assets. Is there a percentage limit for non-pledged debt like personal loans and mortgages? His current debt of this type is about 40% of his total assets. Is this too high?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t worry at all. Personal loans and mortgages are completely different from pledged loans. They don&rsquo;t have market volatility risk and won&rsquo;t trigger a Margin Call if stock prices fall. As long as your salary plus the 2% withdrawal from your pledged line of credit can comfortably cover the interest and principal payments, this debt is safe. A 40% ratio is very healthy, far safer than someone with zero assets but a 9 million mortgage.</li>

<li>Question: She has a down payment for a pre-construction home tied up and is thinking of taking out a personal loan or pledging 20% of her existing investment portfolio to invest an equivalent amount in the market. Which method is better?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I recommend taking out the personal loan first. A personal loan is a loan without market volatility risk, making it relatively safer. You can take out the personal loan to invest in the market and then use the cash flow from your stock pledge (e.g., 2% annually) to pay off the interest and principal of the personal loan. Don&rsquo;t start by borrowing a large sum (like 20%) from your investment portfolio to reinvest; that would increase the risk associated with market fluctuations. Safety first.</li>

<li>Question 1: All her leveraged funds are in a Roth IRA account, and she plans to leave them untouched for another 15 years. Is a Beta value of 1.3 acceptable?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Absolutely not! 15 years is too short a time for a high-leverage allocation. If you encounter a major bear market (like in 2000), your assets might not recover before you retire. Historical data shows it took QLD (2x) 22 years to break even. A Beta of 1.3 is far too risky; you might not be able to retire smoothly. You must lower it immediately, do not exceed 1.0.</li>
</ul>

<li>Question 2: She is seriously considering selling her house because she calculated that investing the money in the market would give her an extra 2 million USD at retirement, and she would save 2 hours of commuting time every day. But she is struggling because her job is in the countryside, while she loves the convenience and life of the city.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Sell it immediately, right now! This is more important than anything.
<ol>
<li><strong>Financial Priority</strong>: The huge financial difference is the primary consideration.</li>
<li><strong>Value of Time</strong>: The saved commuting time is for rest, relaxation, and enjoying life, not for taking on more work.</li>
<li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: While working, you can rent a cheap place in the countryside. When you actually retire, you can move back to the city. At that point, you can choose to rent or buy, giving you complete freedom. Don&rsquo;t sacrifice a huge present benefit for an uncertain future. Procrastinating is losing money.</li>

<li>Question 1: If the stablecoin bill (Genius Act) is so good, why is its implementation delayed until January 28th of next year?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: After any major bill is passed, it takes a few months for the executive branch to prepare the related regulations, website systems, registration processes, etc. This is a normal administrative preparation period, not an intentional delay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Elon Musk criticizes the government for inefficient spending, but according to Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), the more the government spends, the better it is for the economy. How does the teacher view this contradiction?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: From an investor&rsquo;s perspective, as long as the government is willing to spend money, whether it&rsquo;s spent wisely or not, it&rsquo;s a good thing. This is because money flowing stimulates the economy, which will ultimately be reflected in stock prices. The passage of the stablecoin bill will greatly increase market liquidity. When the Treasury issues a $1 bond and a bank buys it, the bank can then issue a $1 stablecoin using the bond as collateral. This effectively doubles the liquidity in the market, making capital extremely abundant. This is a huge positive for the stock market; stock prices will soar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing: Mike also recalled that in the 1980s, you had to place stock trades using a public payphone keypad, with high transaction costs and information asymmetry. In contrast, RWA (Real-World Asset tokenization) and 24-hour trading will be another revolution, greatly promoting capital flow.</li>

The development of AI is exponential, and the productivity revolution it will bring is beyond imagination. Individuals and companies that do not understand or use AI will be eliminated.

<blockquote>
<p>The market has no peak; it will only go higher. So if you don&rsquo;t get into the market quickly, you are losing a lot of opportunities.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: At the beginning of the session, Teacher James commented on the market continually hitting new all-time highs, encouraging investors not to be afraid of heights and to enter the market as soon as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the funds to retire at 65, the problem is not with society, but with you.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Quoting a viewpoint from &ldquo;The Bible of Wealth Management,&rdquo; emphasizing that personal responsibility in investing and financial planning is key to a wealthy retirement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should only buy your first house when you have the ability to buy two. Buying a house should be like buying slippers—if they break, you just get a new pair. Only then is buying a house not a risk.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When explaining the huge risks of real estate, the teacher used a vivid analogy to define what constitutes a &ldquo;risk-free&rdquo; purchase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only index funds can be considered real estate; they can last for a hundred years without spoiling, and the longer you hold them, the more stable they become. This is the asset that can be passed down for generations.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Comparing index funds to traditional real estate, emphasizing their superiority as long-term core assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leveraged funds can go to zero in an instant, you have to know they can go to zero in an instant. So you should only buy them with funds you can afford to lose, and even after buying, you still must practice smart rebalancing.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: After showing the astonishing historical decline of TQQQ, the teacher repeatedly emphasized the risk of leveraged funds going to zero and pointed out the absolute necessity of smart rebalancing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are only two kinds of financial professionals: one is ignorant, and the other is fraudulent. There probably isn&rsquo;t a third kind.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: The teacher&rsquo;s sharp commentary on the nature of most financial experts and professionals in the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who run businesses won&rsquo;t become rich; you have to understand what is called financial operation.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Responding to Hao Qing&rsquo;s sharing, pointing out that it is difficult to achieve great wealth through labor income alone; financial tools (investing and borrowing) are the key.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you only know how to invest but not how to borrow, you will still end up poor.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Further emphasizing that on top of knowing how to invest, learning to use leverage (borrowing) wisely is the advanced path from being well-off to being truly wealthy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The government&rsquo;s debt is the people&rsquo;s savings.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Citing the core idea of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) to explain why government spending and national debt growth are good for the economy and investors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Individuals and businesses without AI will perish or become poor.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When forecasting future economic growth, the teacher asserted the disruptive power of AI technology, stating that those who do not embrace AI will be left behind by the times.</p>

<p>This session covered a rich and profound range of topics, from macroeconomic market trends and investment philosophy to specific asset risk analysis and practical personal financial planning. Teacher James once again reinforced the core strategy of long-term holding of index funds and provided an in-depth analysis and risk warning for two highly tempting yet perilous assets: real estate and leveraged funds. Through the specific method of &ldquo;smart rebalancing,&rdquo; he offered a clear risk control path for investors wishing to use leverage. The Q&amp;A session tightly integrated theory with real-life situations, providing clear guidance on everything from consumption and debt management to understanding new financial legislation. Overall, this was an invaluable lesson that reminds us to stay clear-headed in a bull market—to be brave in embracing growth while always respecting risk.</p>

<p>The core theme of this session is to <strong>break free from a labor mindset and establish a rich mindset</strong>. Traditional wisdom suggests that one needs to work hard, save money, and invest to get rich, while the core of a rich mindset is understanding how to utilize financial leverage. Teacher James illustrates with specific examples how a small principal (e.g., $30,000) can be used to spend far more than the principal (e.g., $1,000,000) through long-term low-interest borrowing (such as stock-backed loans), while the principal itself compounds in the market over the long term, with its future value sufficient to cover all debts. This financial operation of &ldquo;borrowing to spend, never selling assets&rdquo; is where the real big money is, far superior to the &ldquo;peanuts&rdquo; earned from stock picking and short-term trading.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on one, eliminate distractions</strong>: The only investment target is the Nasdaq 100 index fund (e.g., QQQ). Ignore market fluctuations, financial news, analyst opinions, financial reports, and any other recommended ETFs (such as VT, SPY, VTI, and various 0098x and other &ldquo;demonic&rdquo; codes in Taiwan). The teacher guarantees with 40+ years of investment experience that if there were a better target, he would have recommended it long ago.</li>
<li><strong>Trust in predecessors&rsquo; experience, avoid self-trial and error</strong>: Beginners should first accept the warning &ldquo;don&rsquo;t touch fire,&rdquo; meaning don&rsquo;t touch investment targets not recommended by the teacher. Asking questions won&rsquo;t teach you anything; you should calmly watch hundreds of videos first, and then the questions you have will be genuine. Learning from the wisdom and experience of predecessors (e.g., reading classics like &ldquo;Tao Te Ching,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Bible&rdquo;) can help avoid detours, which is the cheapest way to learn in life.</li>
<li><strong>Be highly vigilant of the financial system</strong>: You&rsquo;re alert when you receive a scam call, but you completely trust what financial advisors and insurance agents tell you, and that&rsquo;s the scariest scam. View the <strong>financial industry, insurance industry, and government</strong> as a united potential &ldquo;scam group,&rdquo; and be vigilant about any products they recommend.</li>

<li><strong>Account Configuration Recommendations for US Investors</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Leveraged Funds (QLD, TQQQ)</strong>: Should be 99.99% placed in tax-advantaged retirement accounts (e.g., Roth IRA).</li>
<li><strong>Cash</strong>: Can be placed in any account, but for different purposes.
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash in Roth accounts</strong>: Used for &ldquo;smart rebalancing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Cash in Stock-Backed Loan Accounts (Pledge Account)</strong>: Used to reduce account volatility and prevent margin calls.</li>
<li><strong>Cash in Taxable Accounts or Traditional IRA</strong>: Used to slow down the appreciation rate of that account, which helps with tax planning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Warning for Non-US Residents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not open accounts with US brokers</strong>: Non-US tax residents will face up to 40% estate tax on assets in the US, and accounts may be frozen at any time. The process for descendants to handle inheritance is extremely cumbersome and complex, and lawyer fees may deplete most of the assets.</li>
<li><strong>Keep money close</strong>: Assets should remain in your country of residence. If you live in Taiwan, keep your money in Taiwan; if you live in Hong Kong, keep your money in Hong Kong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Financial Education</strong>: Educating children about finance is more important than academic performance. Children can have poor grades, they can be lazy, but they cannot be ignorant of financial management. In a capitalist society, knowing how to grow assets is more crucial than having a high degree but being a &ldquo;pauper.&rdquo; Cultivate independent thinking and judgment.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Misconceptions of traditional labor mindset</strong>: Believing that one must work hard, save diligently, and invest diligently to have money to spend. This is a passive and inefficient mindset that prevents an easy life.</li>
<li><strong>Core of Rich Mindset – Financial Operations</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>The Art of Borrowing</strong>: The core of borrowing is not to consider the interest rate first, but that the <strong>loan term should be as long as possible</strong>. If a loan can be repaid principal and interest in 40 years, even if the interest rate is as high as 8%, it&rsquo;s worth borrowing because inflation and asset appreciation will far exceed the interest cost.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging Small Capital for Large Assets</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: You currently have $30,000. At an annualized return of 15%, it will grow to nearly $7,000,000 in 40 years. Based on this enormous future asset, you now have the ability to borrow $1,000,000 to spend, as long as this loan is long-term, or even never requires principal repayment (like a stock-backed loan). Your asset growth rate will exceed your debt growth rate.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Don&rsquo;t spend your $30,000; let it snowball. The money you spend is borrowed. This is the essence of financial operations, which involves tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stop Focusing on Small Money</strong>: Don&rsquo;t dwell on stock picking, short-term trading, and other behaviors aimed at earning price differences. These are insignificant like sesame seeds compared to the grand scope of financial operations.</li>

<li>Question 1: Regarding workplace salary, I asked my boss for a $20,000 raise and a $50,000 bonus. My boss agreed to the raise but refused the bonus, which I accepted. I felt that the long-term nature of salary was more important than a one-time bonus. I&rsquo;d like to ask for Teacher James&rsquo;s opinion.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your decision was absolutely correct. Supervisors are usually willing to give raises because the money belongs to the company, not them personally. A fixed salary increase is permanent, while a bonus is one-time and can be canceled by the company at any time. This aligns with our philosophy of long-term investing, which seeks stable and continuous growth (15% annually) rather than short-term spikes (a single day&rsquo;s surge). You&rsquo;ve grasped the key point.</li>

<li>Share 1: I only discovered the teacher&rsquo;s channel in late August and felt like I&rsquo;d struck gold. Within a week, I invested all my funds into the market and plan to invest the money from cashing out my endowment insurance.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Excellent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Share 2: I shared the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy with a beauty industry group I founded, hoping my peers could also benefit, as many in our industry receive advance payments from clients, which serves as excellent interest-free cash flow for investment. However, some people left the group as soon as they heard about investing, which made me feel frustrated and regretful.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: This is a very typical reaction. Topics like investing and politics should not be shared casually in non-homogeneous groups. Every group has its inherent attributes, and abruptly introducing unrelated topics, like discussing politics in a group, will inevitably cause a &ldquo;commotion.&rdquo; You must anticipate such a reaction. Also, a reminder: for advance payments received by businesses, you need to reserve sufficient working capital for operations and not over-invest.</li>
</ul>

<li>Question 1: A client of mine, almost 50 years old, thinks this investment method is too slow and that one doesn&rsquo;t have many 40-year periods in life. I&rsquo;d like to hear the teacher&rsquo;s insights. Also, should the funds from my surrendered endowment insurance all be invested in 00865B (Taiwanese short-term government bond ETF) as cash, or do I need to keep some in a savings account at the bank?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Regarding your client&rsquo;s question, this is a difference in mindset. For fund allocation, cash does not need to be kept in the bank. 00865B has excellent liquidity; if you sell today, the money arrives the day after tomorrow, so it can be used entirely as cash. For daily expenses, try to use credit cards, and then sell 00865B once to repay the bill. Your subsequent income can be vaguely and randomly invested into 00662, 00670L, and 00865B, no need to be overly precise, for example, rotating among the three every four months.</li>

<li>Question 1: I&rsquo;m 53. Due to government housing policies, I&rsquo;m considering selling my self-occupied home in Taoyuan at a low price and renting instead, which would give me about 5 million in cash. Should I use this money to pay off my car loan and personal loan first, and then invest the remaining money using a 70/30 or 60/13/30 strategy? Also, I pay a lot for insurance every month, and some policies are nearing their maturity. What should I do?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You can sell the house and invest the money. But <strong>absolutely do not use the money from selling the house to pay off any loans</strong>. Borrowed money is &ldquo;someone else&rsquo;s chicken&rdquo;; let it lay eggs. Your own money is &ldquo;your own chicken&rdquo;; let it lay eggs too. Use your future salary from re-entering the workforce to make monthly installment payments. For insurance, <strong>immediately, right now, surrender all of it</strong>; take back whatever you can. As long as you stop paying, you win, and you&rsquo;ll have tens of millions more in the future.</li>

<li>Question 1: Regarding the order of placing leveraged funds in accounts, why would Traditional IRA/401k be prioritized over a Brokerage Account? This seems to contradict the idea of &ldquo;putting cash in a Traditional account to slow appreciation.&rdquo; Moreover, future withdrawals from Traditional accounts are taxed at Income Tax rates, which are higher than Brokerage&rsquo;s Capital Gain Tax rates.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This question is more complex. The core reasons are: 1) Leveraged funds cannot be used for stock-backed loans. Placing leveraged funds in a Brokerage account would &ldquo;pollute&rdquo; this account, which might be used for pledging in the future. 2) Leveraged funds have high volatility and will inevitably require rebalancing, which would incur taxes if done in a Brokerage account. Although the future tax rate in a Traditional account is higher, it provides a &ldquo;tax deferral&rdquo; effect, allowing you to operate freely internally without tax worries. More importantly, you don&rsquo;t need to allocate leverage in every account. <strong>The core is to maintain the overall investment portfolio&rsquo;s Beta value at 1.0.</strong> You can achieve Beta 1.0 through leveraged funds in Roth accounts and cash or QQQ in Traditional/Brokerage accounts. This results in the same return but with a superior tax structure and risk control.</li>

<li>Share 1: After listening to the teacher&rsquo;s class, I decided to cancel a life insurance policy I had paid for 7 years, at CAD 20,000 per year. Although I lost CAD 100,000, I felt relieved. My husband also agreed because I calculated for him that even if we only got back a portion of this money, its value in 40 years would far exceed the CAD 1,000,000 insured amount. I don&rsquo;t regret my past decisions because they were made with the knowledge I had at the time, but now my understanding has upgraded.

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: For someone nearing retirement, safety is paramount. First, calculate how many years of living expenses you&rsquo;ll need after retirement and prepare <strong>at least 10-15 years of cash</strong>. For example, if you spend 60,000 a year, you&rsquo;ll need 600,000 in cash for 10 years. Set this money aside first, and then allocate the remaining funds according to your asset allocation ratio.</li>

<li>Question 1: I leveraged an additional NT$15 million from real estate in Taiwan, with an interest rate of 2.88%, renewed annually, with no principal repayment required. Is it feasible to invest this money and then use a portion of the investment profits to pay the interest, continuing this operation? Also, I am currently in the US, with most of my assets in Taiwan. Is this long-term plan suitable?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Short-term operations are feasible. But in the long run, if you and your children will eventually settle in the US, assets should ultimately be transferred to the US. This is primarily to simplify estate planning and avoid Taiwan&rsquo;s relatively high estate tax on large cash assets. The US estate tax exemption is much higher than Taiwan&rsquo;s. You need to be aware of the potential risks and penalties of not declaring overseas assets to the IRS and plan accordingly.</li>

<li>Question 1: In the teacher&rsquo;s simulation, the final asset multiple of the 433 configuration without pledging (5.8x) was higher than that with pledging (4.somethingx). So why should we still choose stock-backed loans?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The simulation results depend on the historical market path. Our simulated period (starting from the 2000 high) was a &ldquo;volatile market&rdquo; with a sharp ten-year decline followed by a slow recovery. In such a market, &ldquo;mindless rebalancing&rdquo; (without pledging) performs better because it dares to buy heavily during downturns. However, in a long-term bull market (e.g., 1980-2000), &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; (with pledging) would outperform. The most important reason we choose pledging is not to pursue the highest return, but to <strong>ensure survival in extreme markets and avoid liquidation.</strong></li>

</li>
<li>Question 2: When actually taking out a stock-backed loan, where does the monthly interest come from? Is it reserved from the $200,000 borrowed?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: No. The interest should also be borrowed. Your total loan limit is very high (e.g., $6 million on $10 million in assets), and you only borrowed $200,000. The monthly interest, a few hundred dollars, can be directly borrowed from your available credit limit. This way, your debt will increase slowly, but your assets will grow at a faster rate.</li>

<p>This session&rsquo;s theme revolves around &ldquo;The market always goes up, live for yourself.&rdquo; The core idea is that the essence of investing is very simple: believe in the market&rsquo;s long-term upward trend and hold on. The real challenge is psychological. Therefore, we should not be disturbed by short-term market fluctuations, financial news, world events, or other external information. Instead, we should shift our focus back to life itself—concentrating on health, happiness, family, and personal values, viewing money as a tool to achieve freedom and abundance in life, not as the ultimate goal.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth and Happiness</strong>: Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right, and health is the foundation. Money is just a tool to achieve a free, abundant, and happy life; investing itself is not the purpose of life.</li>
<li><strong>Children&rsquo;s Education</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Focus on cultivating the right values in children (not stealing, robbing, breaking the law, or taking drugs) and appreciating their talents, rather than just focusing on academic performance.</li>
<li>Parents should not impose their own expectations or unfulfilled dreams on their children, such as forcing them to study abroad. This puts immense pressure on the children.</li>
<li>A true home is where the parents are. Children should be encouraged to pursue their own ideals, not to satisfy their parents&rsquo; expectations.</li>
<li>Compared to buying a house for a child, it&rsquo;s better to have and raise the child first, because wealth can be created, but childbirth has a time window.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Live in the Present, Focus on Yourself</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In life, focus on your own goals. Don&rsquo;t get sidetracked by trivial matters (like fussing over exchange rates or searching for better investments), as this will only delay the process of achieving financial freedom.</li>
<li>Teacher James uses his own management experience as an example: At the company, he focused on only the three most important tasks each day. Once completed, he could go home. This approach is efficient and goal-oriented. Conversely, trying to do everything results in being busy all day with nothing accomplished.</li>
<li>Live your own life, not one led by the media and online information. Cutting off useless external information will not result in any loss.</li>
<li>True living is about &ldquo;presence&rdquo;—living in the moment. Whether eating, gardening, or traveling, you should be fully engaged and feel the beauty of life itself. External distractions, like what Trump said, have no bearing on our lives or investments.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do the Right Thing and Persist</strong>: The secret to successful investing is to &ldquo;do the right thing and stick with it for the long term.&rdquo; For example, invest whenever you have money, regardless of the exchange rate, without timing the market. Once you have identified the right path (like investing in QQQ), you should forge ahead without looking back.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Mortgage</strong>:
<ul>
<li>This is an excellent tool for &ldquo;activating assets&rdquo; and is not just for people short on cash.</li>
<li>It provides a steady cash flow, as if the house is working for you. This money can be used for investment, thus increasing your assets while retaining the property.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a great option for parents with insufficient retirement funds, allowing them to live better lives without their children needing to provide financial support.</li>
<li>For elderly individuals with weak financial management skills and only one house left, a reverse mortgage is more stable than selling the house to invest, avoiding the risk of losing their last home.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Borrowing to Invest</strong>:
<ul>
<li>An example: If you use your own $30,000 to buy a car, the potential value of that money in 50 years (about $32 million) is lost. But if you take a pledged loan of $30,000 to buy the car and invest your own $30,000, in 50 years you will have $32 million in assets, while the debt is only $340,000.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Make good use of financial leverage. Borrow for consumption or investment, and let your own money continue to grow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example of Leveraged Asset Allocation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Teacher James shares his asset allocation model: 40% QQQ (1x), 15% QLD (2x), 10% TQQQ (3x), and 35% cash.</li>
<li>The Beta value of this portfolio is calculated as: (40% * 1) + (15% * 2) + (10% * 3) = 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.3 = 1.0.</li>
<li>This allocation, while having an overall risk comparable to holding 100% QQQ (Beta=1.0), retains a large amount of cash (35%) for risk control and rebalancing during market downturns.</li>
<li><strong>Key Point</strong>: Any asset allocation that includes leveraged funds <strong>must</strong> implement a smart rebalancing strategy.</li>
</ul>

<li>Sharing: She once went against everyone&rsquo;s advice to support her sister&rsquo;s dream of a working holiday in Australia. Now, her sister is living very happily in Germany. She has come to realize that since her child doesn&rsquo;t want to study abroad, she&rsquo;ll save the money for her own study tours in retirement. She is practicing not imposing her expectations on her child.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: That&rsquo;s excellent. One must live for oneself, not for others. Don&rsquo;t impose your expectations on people. For children, parents only have the duty to agree, not the right to disagree. Your child&rsquo;s life is not under your jurisdiction.</li>

<li>Sharing: After renting out a house he owns, he recently took it back for his own use and found being a landlord very troublesome. He had to deal with various damages and cleaning for walls, doors, and windows, and deeply realized that the actual return on real estate investment is not as high as it seems.</li>
<li>Question 1: Since the house was bought by his family, he can&rsquo;t sell it freely. He&rsquo;s thinking of taking out a mortgage-like loan on the house (interest-only payments) and investing the cash into 00662. Is this idea feasible?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Absolutely correct, you should do it immediately. Borrow any money you can as soon as possible. The power of borrowing to invest is immense. He demonstrated the huge opportunity cost difference by calculating the 50-year outcomes of buying a car with $30,000 versus borrowing $1 million.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: The teacher advises young people to invest first and buy a house later when they are &ldquo;old.&rdquo; What age does &ldquo;old&rdquo; approximately refer to?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You will know when the time comes; you don&rsquo;t need someone else to tell you. When you are wealthy enough, buying a house will be as easy as buying slippers, and you can even use borrowed money to buy one casually. At that point, you could also choose to live in a luxurious retirement community—the choice is yours.</li>

<li>Question: She is in her fifties/sixties and wants to take out a pledged loan in China on her fully paid-off house, but banks only offer a maximum term of 3-5 years, which is too risky. How does the teacher obtain long-term loans?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The best long-term loan is a &ldquo;stock-pledged loan,&rdquo; which can be structured to never pay back the principal, and even the interest can be rolled into the principal. Mortgages and personal loans have fixed terms and are not suitable. For short-term loans (like 3-5 years), don&rsquo;t borrow unless you are confident you can repay even if the market crashes. He suggests she sell her house in China, even at a lower price, as long as she can liquidate it. Abroad, she can try using Interactive Brokers (IB) for stock-pledged loans.</li>

<li>Sharing: Inspired by the teacher, he successfully borrowed a large sum of money from the bank against his assets and discovered that car loans don&rsquo;t count towards his debt ratio. He plans to use a 2% pledged loan to pay off the car loan, thereby investing more funds into the 433 allocation. He now feels that the speed of his asset growth has surpassed his annual salary.</li>
<li>Question: He saw a YouTuber say that Chinese engineers in Silicon Valley are unhappy due to endless &ldquo;comparisons&rdquo; (of degrees, companies, salaries, houses, wives, children). As someone with a master&rsquo;s degree, he also felt insecure in an environment full of PhDs. How does the teacher view &ldquo;comparison&rdquo;? And how can the teacher confidently pay his subordinates a higher salary than his own?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Quoting Munger, &ldquo;Envy is a really stupid sin.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t compare; the key is a strong inner self. You must affirm from within that you are the best. The way you see yourself is more important than how others see you. He uses his own experience of leading a team of PhDs without a PhD himself, and designing Microsoft&rsquo;s Media architecture and the computer Hibernate patent, to illustrate that success is unrelated to academic degrees but is related to confidence and intellect.</li>

<li>Question 1: She is 60 and retired. As recommended, she has allocated TQQQ in her smaller Roth IRA account. However, the AI on Chen Feng&rsquo;s website advises her not to use leverage at her age and to keep many years of cash. How much cash should a retiree actually keep? Is it 30% or 15 years&rsquo; worth of living expenses?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t fully trust the AI; follow the teacher&rsquo;s instruction. Her allocation (TQQQ in Roth, cash in Traditional IRA) is correct. Retirees should keep <strong>30% cash</strong>, which is approximately equivalent to <strong>15 years&rsquo; worth</strong> of living expenses. This is not due to pessimism about the market; on the contrary, the market may rise even faster in the future. This is the result of the CLEC investment system&rsquo;s &ldquo;DNA evolution&rdquo; after being tested by the market, making it better able to withstand future extreme risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: She saw other financial bloggers advocating for market timing using &ldquo;economic indicator signals&rdquo; and is worried that buying TQQQ at a market high will lead to significant decay.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t refer to other people&rsquo;s investment systems; they won&rsquo;t be compatible. Within the 433 asset allocation, there is no so-called &ldquo;decay&rdquo; problem for TQQQ because the large cash reserve acts as a buffer, and the actual drop of the portfolio during a downturn will be less than that of 100% QQQ.</li>

<li>Question 1: She is 43 and just immigrated to the US. Her 401k and IRA accounts have very little money. To implement the 433 allocation, it seems she can only buy leveraged ETFs in a taxable brokerage account. Is this acceptable?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes. In the early stages when funds are insufficient, you can use a 433 allocation in a brokerage account to maintain a higher Beta and sufficient cash. Although rebalancing will generate taxes, the priority is to &ldquo;make money first.&rdquo; However, you must <strong>do smart rebalancing every year</strong>, because a 30% leveraged position is very risky and cannot be left unattended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: For dollar-cost averaging for an 11-year-old child, the teacher previously recommended QLD. Why not the better TQQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: TQQQ has extremely high volatility. Calculating from the 2000 peak, it might take over 20 years to break even, whereas QLD breaks even faster. For a child&rsquo;s long-term investment of over 20 years, both are acceptable, but the premise is that you <strong>must persist in buying continuously</strong>, regardless of market ups and downs. If the investment horizon is uncertain or you want to be more conservative, QLD is the safer choice.</li>

<li>Question: Should high-net-worth families be concerned about the 40% US estate tax? Should they set up an irrevocable trust in advance to avoid it?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: First, the US estate tax exemption has been permanently set at $15 million per person, meaning a couple has a $30 million exemption. Most families don&rsquo;t need to worry. Second, he does not recommend setting up an irrevocable charitable trust because they usually require an annual donation of 5% of assets, which is a huge burden and constraint on the children. A better way is to use the annual gift tax exclusion (e.g., $20,000) and start gifting early. Over the long term, the growth of the gifted assets will far exceed the estate tax exemption amount.</li>

<li>Question: She (in Canada) obtained extra cash for investment through a home refinance. Can the interest on this portion of the loan be deducted as an investment expense for tax purposes?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Only when you sell an asset and generate a realized capital gain do you have taxable investment income against which related expenses might be deducted. If you just hold and don&rsquo;t sell, there is no taxable event. Canada&rsquo;s Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is similar to the US Roth IRA, and investment and rebalancing operations should be conducted within it.</li>

<li>Question (from the comment section): With 30 million TWD in assets, if I withdraw 2% for living expenses, 600,000 per year is not enough. Do I have to wait until my assets double to 60 million to live a good life?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Not necessarily. You can increase the withdrawal rate by adjusting your asset allocation. For example, you can change the 433 allocation (Beta=1) to a 424 or 514 allocation with a higher cash percentage, which lowers the portfolio&rsquo;s volatility (Beta&lt;1). Once the volatility is reduced, the annual withdrawal rate can be safely increased to 3% or 3.5%.</li>

<li>Question (from the comment section): Is it okay for a 12-year-old child to dollar-cost average into 00670L (a 2x leveraged ETF in Taiwan)?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: If you can ensure continuous investment for over 20 years (e.g., until age 32), it is acceptable. However, if the investment horizon is shorter (e.g., until they become independent at 24), it is recommended to do half-and-half (half leveraged, half non-leveraged) or invest entirely in the non-leveraged ETF to reduce risk.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right, and health is the foundation of life.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: At the beginning of the class, the teacher explained the relationship between investment and life, emphasizing that our ultimate goals are happiness and health, while wealth is an innate right and a tool to achieve those goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you living your own life, or a life defined by the external environment? Don&rsquo;t be led by outside information.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: The teacher advised students not to be engrossed in media and online information all day, as that is living a life defined by others, not their own. One should return to their inner self and focus on their own life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Envy is a really stupid sin.
&ndash; Teacher James (quoting Charlie Munger)</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When answering a student&rsquo;s question about &ldquo;comparison,&rdquo; the teacher quoted Munger&rsquo;s famous line, pointing out that comparing oneself to others is a source of unhappiness and a foolish act.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are what you think you are, and that is more important than how others see you. If you don&rsquo;t even believe in what you are, how can others believe in what you are?
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: The teacher encouraged students to build self-confidence. He believes that personal value is determined by self-perception, not by external evaluations or labels like academic degrees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When borrowing money, we don&rsquo;t fear high interest rates; we fear that the term is too short.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When answering a question about loans, the teacher stressed the importance of the loan term. As long as the term is long enough, even with a higher interest rate, the long-term growth of assets is sufficient to cover the costs, whereas short-term loans carry immense risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be clear about what you want. For everything else that is different from what you want, you don&rsquo;t need to care, you don&rsquo;t need to mind, and you don&rsquo;t need to compare.
&ndash; Chen Feng</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Student Chen Feng shared this perspective when explaining how he avoids the &ldquo;comparison&rdquo; mindset. He believes that as long as you are clear about your own goals, you will not be disturbed by external factors unrelated to them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you keep following our DNA, your DNA will evolve. This is how you can prepare for potential future risks and changes.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When explaining why he now recommends holding more cash (30%), the teacher compared the CLEC investment system to a biological DNA. This system continuously evolves after being tested by the market, becoming better adapted to various future environments. Therefore, students need to keep learning to acquire this &ldquo;evolved&rdquo; and robust system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are 100% in leveraged funds, you might go to hell; it would be like a dream that ends in 30 years.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When reminding students of the risks of leveraged funds, the teacher seriously pointed out that being fully invested in leveraged funds without asset allocation and rebalancing could ultimately lead to a total loss in a major market crash.</p>

<p>This session once again emphasized the core of the CLEC investment philosophy: investing is simple, mindset is supreme. Starting from a high-level life philosophy, Teacher James guided everyone to shift their focus from the complex noise of the market to the simple purity of their personal lives, fostering the belief to &ldquo;live for yourself.&rdquo; The course not only shared profound insights on children&rsquo;s education and self-worth realization but also delved into the practical application of financial tools like &ldquo;reverse mortgages&rdquo; and &ldquo;pledged loans.&rdquo; It also provided detailed explanations on the risk control and long-term operational principles of asset allocation (especially the 433 strategy involving leveraged funds). Through active questions and sharing from students, many practical confusions—such as allocation in different accounts, tax issues, and retirement cash flow planning—were clearly answered. Ultimately, the course returned to a fundamental point: build a strong inner self and adhere to the right principles, and wealth will naturally follow.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Core Philosophy</strong>: The market has no ceiling; it will only go higher. The simplest and most effective investment method is to &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, and never sell.&rdquo; The only thing investors need to do is buy; they don&rsquo;t even need to consider selling. This simple truth is often not understood by the public, while the media prefers sensational and &ldquo;bloodthirsty&rdquo; headlines to attract attention.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Cannot Be Taught, Only Learned</strong>: The teacher stresses that even if the audience listens to what he says, they may not truly learn it. True mastery comes from investors spending their own time watching videos, thinking independently, and studying.</li>
<li><strong>Introduction to a Powerful Learning Resource Library</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Chen Feng&rsquo;s Platform</strong>: Page 20 of the lecture notes provides a link to the platform organized by Chen Feng, which integrates all of CLEC&rsquo;s important resources.</li>
<li><strong>Annual Playlists</strong>: The platform allows direct access to the complete course playlists for 2023 and 2024, making it convenient for new students to learn systematically.</li>
<li><strong>AI Interactive Tool (NotebookLM)</strong>: Chen Feng has &ldquo;fed&rdquo; the content of CLEC&rsquo;s long and short videos into an AI model to create a knowledge base. Students can log in with their Google account and ask the AI questions in a conversational manner. The AI will provide relevant answers based on the questions and indicate which videos the knowledge comes from, greatly improving the efficiency of learning and finding information.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Statement Learning Resources</strong>: The teacher specifically shared the <strong>2018</strong> and <strong>2022</strong> course playlists on the YouTube channel, which contain complete instructional content on financial statement analysis, suitable for students who want to study in-depth.</li>
<li><strong>The Teacher&rsquo;s ChatGPT</strong>: Page 23 of the lecture notes provides a link to the ChatGPT trained by James himself, which is also a powerful learning tool.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>For the Young or Those with Insufficient Funds</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: When your total capital is not enough to cover <strong>three years</strong> of annual expenses, complex asset allocation is not recommended.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: First, save up <strong>one year</strong> of emergency funds (in cash or a money market fund). Any amount exceeding the emergency fund should be fully invested in QQQ or 00662.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If your annual expense is 100,000 and your total assets are 160,000, then 100,000 should be kept as an emergency fund, and only 60,000 can be invested.</li>
<li><strong>Turning Point</strong>: When the cash portion can reach about 30% of your total assets, and this amount already exceeds one year&rsquo;s expenses, you can start considering a more systematic asset allocation. For example, with total assets of 500,000 and annual expenses of 100,000, 30% cash is 150,000, which is higher than the 100,000 emergency fund requirement. At this point, you can start asset allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation and Pledging Strategy for High-Net-Worth Individuals (433 Model)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Case Study</strong>: A 35-year-old friend with 60 million in assets uses a 433 asset allocation (40% QQQ, 30% QLD, 30% short-term bonds/cash).</li>
<li><strong>2% Living Expense Rule</strong>: Borrow 2% of <strong>total assets</strong> annually for living expenses through stock pledging. In this case, it&rsquo;s 2% of 60 million, which is 1.2 million per year. <strong>The key is that it&rsquo;s based on total assets, not 2% of a single holding (like QQQ)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Long-Term Growth</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In the 10th year: Total assets are expected to grow from 60 million to about 200 million, while total debt (including interest) will be around 14 million, resulting in a very healthy debt ratio of only 7%.</li>
<li>At that point, the living expense standard can be raised, for example, to live on 1% (2 million/year) or 2% (4 million/year) of 200 million.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rebalancing and Taxes</strong>: After significant asset growth, you can re-allocate your assets. For U.S. investors, rebalancing within a ROTH account can effectively avoid capital gains tax, which is highly efficient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Health First: Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Importance</strong>: The teacher strongly recommends that everyone, especially friends over 40, pay for an LDCT lung cancer screening.</li>
<li><strong>Judgment Criteria</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If a nodule smaller than 0.6cm is found, there is no need to worry excessively; annual follow-ups are sufficient.</li>
<li>If a nodule larger than 0.8cm is found, you must immediately consult a thoracic specialist. The doctor will arrange for follow-up tracking (usually covered by health insurance). If the nodule shows signs of growth during the observation period, it needs to be dealt with promptly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Core Idea</strong>: Early detection and early treatment are key. Do not neglect screening out of fear of &ldquo;false positives.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: My son lives in Taiwan, but his US dollar income is directly deposited into a Hong Kong account. Should he bring the money back to Taiwan to buy 00662, or open an account in Hong Kong to buy QQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The core principle is &ldquo;<strong>If you are in Taiwan, your money should be in Taiwan</strong>.&rdquo; Funds should not be kept in Hong Kong. Remit the money back to Taiwan and declare it as income for tax purposes normally. Don&rsquo;t worry about exchange rate fluctuations; in the long run, the average exchange rate from remitting in batches will tend towards an expected value. The exchange rate is irrelevant to long-term investment. If you have money, you should buy immediately and not let the exchange rate influence your decision.</li>

<li>Question 2: Regarding the 60 million asset case, living off a 2% pledge (1.2 million) annually, if I only need 1% (600,000), should I only withdraw 1%, or withdraw 2% and invest the extra 1% back?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Just withdraw the 1% you need. You can choose not to use the extra credit line, or you can borrow it to reinvest, which will make you grow faster. Both are acceptable.</li>

<li>Question 1: She is 63 this year and has already converted part of her Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Her company&rsquo;s 401k also allows Roth contributions. Should she, from now on, choose Roth for everything she can convert and contribute to?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes, that is very correct and urgent. First, all future contributions should go into a Roth 401k. Second, she has 1.7M in a Traditional IRA and must speed up the conversion. Otherwise, she will face a huge tax burden at age 75 due to RMD (Required Minimum Distribution). Based on calculations, she needs to convert about 270,000 per year to finish before age 75. It&rsquo;s easier to convert now while she has work income than after retirement when she has no cash flow. Consider borrowing from a pledged account to pay the conversion tax.</li>

<li>Question 1: Is it necessary for high-net-worth individuals to do stock pledging?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Not necessarily, but this is precisely the difference between being &ldquo;<strong>rich</strong>&rdquo; and being &ldquo;<strong>super-rich</strong>.&rdquo; He used a striking example: with 60 million in assets, if you use pledged loans for living expenses (allowing the principal to compound at 15%), your net worth could reach <strong>15.8 billion</strong> after 40 years. However, if you don&rsquo;t pledge and instead sell assets for living expenses each year (causing the total return rate to drop to 13%), your assets will only be <strong>800 million</strong> after 40 years, a difference of nearly 20 times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: What should be the order of borrowing? Mortgage, personal loan, stock pledge—which takes priority?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You can use lower-interest mortgages or personal loans to borrow funds and invest them in the market (buy QQQ/00662), and then use the money borrowed from stock pledging to pay the monthly installments of the mortgage or personal loan. This frees up your salary, allowing 100% of it to be reinvested, creating a powerful positive cycle. This is the most efficient way to grow wealth.</li>

<li>Question: To reconfirm the case of using 2% of a 60 million asset base annually, does this refer to selling 2% of stocks or taking a pledged loan?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The case we discussed refers to <strong>pledged loans</strong>. Of course, for those who do not use pledging, they can also choose to sell 2% of their stocks each year to cover living expenses.</li>

<li>Question 1: Is investing in QQQ equivalent to investing in a country (the United States) and the future of humanity?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes, investing in QQQ is about believing in technology, believing in America, and believing that humanity will continue to progress.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: How should we view the Buffett Indicator (Total US Stock Market Cap / GDP Ratio) being at a historical high, suggesting the market is overvalued?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a fundamental conceptual error. <strong>GDP is like your annual salary, a flow concept; market capitalization is like your total net worth, an accumulation of stock over decades</strong>. Comparing your one-year salary to your decades of total assets and then saying your assets are in a bubble is completely illogical. This indicator has no reference value.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: He feels that the more he learns, the harder it is to communicate with friends who don&rsquo;t understand investing.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: That shouldn&rsquo;t be the case. In theory, <strong>the more you know, the easier it should be to communicate with others in simpler, more accessible terms</strong>, just like a university professor can explain complex mathematical concepts to a middle school student. The key to communication is to listen and adjust your frequency to match the other person&rsquo;s, rather than adopting a &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; mentality. If the other person cannot accept it, you can say, &ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; and end the conversation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing 2: When he talks about investing with friends, their first reaction is always &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have money,&rdquo; and they hope to find a &ldquo;guaranteed profit, no-risk&rdquo; method.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is the &ldquo;fatalistic&rdquo; thinking instilled in many people by their families of origin and culture, such as &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no such thing as a free lunch&rdquo; and &ldquo;only hard work leads to wealth.&rdquo; The truth is, <strong>it is very difficult to become rich through work alone. Only those who understand financial operations and investing can achieve financial freedom</strong>. The financial system in the United States (like the 401k) encourages the entire population to invest, whereas many emerging countries are still stuck in the stage of encouraging hard work alone.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1 (The Importance of Roth): She is in the US, and one of the biggest changes after getting to know the teacher was converting all her 401k to Roth. She reminds everyone that a Traditional 401k is only tax-deferred, not tax-free. For those who know how to invest, retirement accounts will grow to a very large amount, and withdrawals from a traditional account will face terrifying tax rates. Young people must choose Roth.</li>
<li>Sharing 2 (New US Tax Law Rule): As a payroll system expert, she shared a new rule effective in 2025: for people over 50 with an annual income exceeding $145,000, their additional &ldquo;Catch-up&rdquo; contributions can only be put into a Roth 401k, no longer into a pre-tax Traditional 401k.</li>
<li>Sharing 3 (Pledging vs. Selling): She strongly agrees with the teacher&rsquo;s &ldquo;chicken and golden egg&rdquo; analogy. Selling stocks is like killing the chicken that lays golden eggs. Not only is the chicken gone, but you also have to pay taxes on the income from selling the chicken, which is a double loss. Pledging allows the chicken to continue laying eggs; you are just borrowing some future eggs. It is a superior strategy.</li>
<li>Question: She is planning her post-retirement operational sequence: first, sell company stock and convert to QQQ; then, convert SPY to QQQ; and finally, convert Traditional 401k to Roth annually as needed. She asks if this sequence is reasonable.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The sequence is reasonable. The key is to calculate and control the annual operations to fall within the ideal tax bracket. He also suggests that she can allocate some cash within her Traditional 401k to slow its growth rate, thereby reducing the future tax burden upon conversion. However, she should also be careful not to sacrifice too much of the overall portfolio&rsquo;s return (Beta) in the process.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You can log in, but be wary of tax issues. Brokerages like Futu, Tiger, and Interactive Brokers are registered in the US as overseas brokers. Their assets are considered US assets and are subject to <strong>US estate tax</strong>, which requires special care.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: If my company&rsquo;s 401k investment options are very poor, should I give it up and only invest in a brokerage account?

<blockquote>
<p>The market has no ceiling, it will only go higher, so you don&rsquo;t have to do anything, you don&rsquo;t have to worry, it will hit new highs and bring you immense wealth.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: At the beginning of the session, the teacher emphasized the mindset investors should have—a firm belief in the long-term upward trend of the market, which is the cornerstone of adopting a &ldquo;buy and hold&rdquo; strategy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investing can&rsquo;t be taught, it can only be learned by oneself. You won&rsquo;t get it just by listening to me. If you don&rsquo;t learn it yourself, you won&rsquo;t get it.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: After introducing numerous learning tools, the teacher stressed the importance of proactive learning and self-exploration in the field of investment. Attending lectures is just the starting point; true understanding requires personal practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are in Taiwan, your money should be in Taiwan.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When answering Bruce&rsquo;s question about his son&rsquo;s US dollar income in Hong Kong, the teacher gave this clear and concise principle, emphasizing that funds should be consistent with one&rsquo;s place of residence for ease of management and tax compliance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This (pledging or not) is the difference between being rich and being super-rich.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When explaining why one should use stock pledging, the teacher used an example showing a nearly twenty-fold difference in assets after 40 years, vividly illustrating the huge impact of using (or not using) leverage tools on the ultimate scale of wealth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your salary is the so-called GDP, and your salary increase is GDP growth. Your assets are the result of past accumulation, so our market value is the result of past accumulation.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When refuting the bearish market argument that the &ldquo;Market Cap to GDP ratio is too high,&rdquo; the teacher used the analogy of personal salary versus total assets to clearly reveal the logical fallacy of this indicator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more you know, the easier it should be to communicate with people.
&ndash; Teacher James
Background: In response to a student&rsquo;s confusion about finding it harder to communicate as they learn more, the teacher pointed out that true wisdom is demonstrated by the ability to simplify complexity and communicate effectively with people at different levels of understanding.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you just sell stocks&hellip; you are essentially killing one of your chickens. Not only will this chicken no longer lay eggs for you, but the chicken itself is also gone.
&ndash; Penny</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: In her sharing, Penny used the vivid &ldquo;killing the goose that lays the golden eggs&rdquo; analogy to profoundly explain the essential difference and the pros and cons between selling stocks for living expenses and using stock pledging to borrow funds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely impossible to become wealthy through work. People who work longer might even become poorer. Only those who understand will become rich, and those who know how to borrow money will become super-rich.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Commenting on the prevalent societal belief of &ldquo;getting rich through hard work,&rdquo; the teacher revealed the truth about wealth growth, emphasizing the importance of financial literacy and the skillful use of leverage.</p>

<p>This session began by reaffirming the investment anchor of &ldquo;buy and hold, never sell,&rdquo; instilling strong confidence in investors amidst a volatile market. Teacher James and senior student Chen Feng detailed the newly integrated AI learning platform, tools that will significantly enhance students&rsquo; efficiency in self-directed learning. The core discussion, through an analysis of asset allocation strategies for young people and high-net-worth individuals, clearly outlined a path to wealth from accumulation to the skillful use of capital. The in-depth interpretation of stock pledging, in particular, revealed its immense potential as a wealth amplifier. The Q&amp;A session was exceptionally insightful, not only solving students&rsquo; specific problems in areas like taxation, retirement planning, and asset allocation but also providing profound inspiration regarding investment mindset, communication wisdom, and information discernment. This was a comprehensive sharing that covered everything from the Tao (investment philosophy) to the techniques (specific strategies) and the tools (learning instruments).</p>

<p>This session revolves around the core concept of long-term investing—a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; approach. James emphasizes that investors should ignore short-term market fluctuations, macroeconomic data, financial reports, and even political news, and instead, stick to buying and holding high-quality assets (like QQQ) for the long term. The key to success is not in predicting market highs and lows, but in proper risk management, which means using sensible asset allocation and maintaining sufficient cash reserves to handle any market condition. The market has no peak; it will only go higher. Investors should focus on the future 20 years from now, rather than worrying about tomorrow&rsquo;s ups and downs.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Do Nothing&rdquo; Approach</strong>: The best investment strategy is to buy and then leave it alone; the market will naturally reach new highs. Trying to manage or predict the market is more likely to lead to failure.</li>
<li><strong>Ignore Market Noise</strong>: Investors don&rsquo;t need to care about what Trump or Putin says, nor should they pay attention to economic data like PPI and CPI or company earnings reports. This short-term information is irrelevant to long-term investing.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Time</strong>: Investing requires a long-term view, at least a 20-year horizon. Thinking about the person you want to become in 20 years is more meaningful than worrying about tomorrow&rsquo;s market. Getting rich overnight is impossible, but going bankrupt overnight is common, which is why risk control is crucial.</li>

<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: The only way to face market volatility is through proper asset allocation and having enough cash, not by trying to predict the market.</li>
<li><strong>Investing with Loans</strong>: Whether it&rsquo;s a personal loan or a mortgage, you must ensure you can repay it with your salary. For retirees with no income, taking out a wealth management mortgage is not recommended; a reverse mortgage could be considered to increase cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging</strong>: When pledging stocks, you must also understand asset allocation and keep enough cash on hand to deal with market fluctuations, avoiding a margin call due to a market downturn.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Limitations of Currencies</strong>: The domestic currencies of emerging countries (like the New Taiwan Dollar) are not internationally circulated and cannot be directly converted into US dollars.</li>
<li><strong>Sources of Foreign Exchange Reserves</strong>: A country&rsquo;s foreign exchange reserves mainly come from two channels:
<ol>
<li><strong>Current Account</strong>: Earning foreign currency by exporting goods and services, such as TSMC&rsquo;s export revenues. These are called &ldquo;slave dollars&rdquo; because a great deal of labor is required to earn them.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Account</strong>: Inflow of foreign capital for investment (e.g., buying stocks). This capital can come and go quickly, easily causing financial turmoil and leading to national bankruptcy.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Bankruptcy</strong>: When a country&rsquo;s export capability is weak and it relies heavily on foreign capital from the financial account, it faces a financial crisis or even national bankruptcy if that foreign capital withdraws on a large scale and its foreign reserves are insufficient to cope.</li>

<li><strong>Opportunity Cost is a Real Loss</strong>: Short-term paper losses are temporary and non-existent. However, the gains you miss out on due to hesitation (the money you could have earned) are a permanent and tangible loss.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If QQQ rises from 400 to 577, and you didn&rsquo;t buy at 400, you have permanently lost that 177 in profit. This loss can never be recovered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Act Immediately</strong>: Therefore, you should buy immediately when you have the money; this is the action with the highest expected value. The later you buy, the less you earn, the lower your wealth growth base becomes, and the wider the gap between you and others will grow.</li>

<li>Sharing: He recently read discussions about how AI will change the world, which made him feel that he shouldn&rsquo;t retire in the next 10 years. He feels he should work hard as this might be his last job opportunity, and he doesn&rsquo;t want to sell his growing QQQ for living expenses.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: The decision to work should not be based on fear of the future (like AI replacing jobs). You should ask yourself: Do you like your job? Are you working for money or for happiness? This is the fundamental reason that should determine whether you continue to work, regardless of the AI era or a future space age.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: He recently saw online discussions about &ldquo;geographic arbitrage,&rdquo; which involves moving to Southeast Asian countries with lower living costs (like Thailand or Vietnam) to make savings last longer. He wants to ask if this approach is feasible and what the risks or recommendations are.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;arbitrage&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s &ldquo;having no way out.&rdquo; Moving to a place you don&rsquo;t genuinely like just to save money is a form of external diseconomy and is not advisable. We should strive to live in an environment we like and find convenient, not be forced into a choice because of a lack of money. If you move to Hualien or Taitung because they are beautiful, that&rsquo;s the right choice even if it costs more than Taipei. But if it&rsquo;s just to save money, it&rsquo;s the wrong choice.</li>

<li>Sharing: He shared his understanding of &ldquo;happiness.&rdquo; In the past, his happiness came from external recognition like good grades or promotions. After learning James&rsquo;s financial concepts, he believes true happiness is simple, like seeing an old couple quietly eating an apple at the foot of Mount Fuji. At that moment, past achievements no longer mattered.</li>
<li>Question: He understands Adler&rsquo;s principle of &ldquo;separation of tasks,&rdquo; but he still feels sad when he sees friends and family struggling in the cycle of hard work. He knows he can&rsquo;t force them to change, but he wants to ask how to adjust this feeling of &ldquo;not being able to bear it.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: My view of happiness is &ldquo;whatever, it&rsquo;s all good, it doesn&rsquo;t matter&rdquo;—that is, happiness is having no burdens. The situation you described is much like a doctor&rsquo;s dilemma: seeing a patient who can&rsquo;t afford a necessary stent, the doctor is helpless. Poverty is a disease, and we can&rsquo;t save everyone; even the thousand-armed Guanyin has limits. What you can do is tell them the correct concept once, fulfilling your responsibility. Those who believe will be saved. For those who don&rsquo;t, you must learn to let go, or you won&rsquo;t be able to live your own life well.</li>

<li>Question: While listening to Howard Marks&rsquo;s audiobook, he understood that market cycles don&rsquo;t have a fixed length but are driven by the collective sentiment of the masses. When the market is extremely euphoric, it&rsquo;s a bubble, and vice versa. Is this understanding correct?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Your understanding is completely correct. The only indicator of a bubble, as Howard Marks says, is that &ldquo;investors have gone crazy&rdquo;; there are no other quantitative metrics. But the difficulty with this theory is in its execution. Everyone is in a different environment and has a different perception of the market&rsquo;s &ldquo;temperature,&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s very hard to pinpoint the peak. The theory is correct, but how to apply it is the key.</li>

<li>Sharing: She introduced James&rsquo;s investment philosophy to a very conservative elder, who ultimately only agreed to invest NT$20,000 per month into 006208 (a Taiwanese ETF) on a regular basis. She feels a bit anxious about this, thinking it&rsquo;s too slow.</li>
<li>Question: This elder insists they have an insurance policy bought 30-40 years ago with an 8% return. She suspects this was just a sales pitch from the agent back then and wants to ask how to explain to the elder that the actual return on this policy is likely not that high.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: First, don&rsquo;t be anxious. If the person involved isn&rsquo;t in a hurry, we shouldn&rsquo;t be either. You don&rsquo;t know if your advice will save them or harm them. What if they invest and the market drops in the short term? They will blame you. Taking it slow is a good thing. Regarding the insurance policy, an 8% return is almost impossible. You need to calculate the actual annualized rate of return (IRR or XIRR), not a simple arithmetic average. Especially considering the funds invested early on were locked up for 20-30 years with no return, the opportunity cost during that period is enormous. A rough estimate shows that if the same money (NT$750,000 invested annually for 20 years) were put into the market (at a 10% annualized return), it would become NT$100 million after 28 years. The policy, however, only pays out NT$1 million per year, making the return not even 1%. It&rsquo;s essentially a product from a &ldquo;scam group.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Sharing: A follow-up on family financial communication. He realized that for large investments (like consolidating a mortgage to free up several million), he must get his wife&rsquo;s consent. His current strategy is &ldquo;slowly might be faster,&rdquo; gradually gaining his wife&rsquo;s understanding and trust through continuous communication, sharing small gains, and explaining the long-term philosophy. He believes it&rsquo;s very important for a couple to be on the same page; otherwise, even if he makes money from investments, it could cause family conflicts.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Your approach is absolutely correct. Take it slow, and make sure your spouse feels involved and secure. For example, you can put a portion of the money from the loan into your wife&rsquo;s account for her to manage. When she sees cash in the account, she will feel more at ease. Never make decisions on your own. Even if you succeed, your partner might get angry for not being respected, which could lead to a broken marriage.</li>

<li>Question: James mentioned that one of the three principles of asset allocation is to consider the extreme scenario of &ldquo;interest rates rising to infinity.&rdquo; He is worried that if a situation like the 1980s in the U.S. occurs, with interest rates as high as 20%, our current backtesting models based on the last 20 years of data might not hold up. Is he worrying too much?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This is an excellent question. The way to deal with such an extreme situation is to hold more cash. If you are worried about a &ldquo;stagflation&rdquo; environment like the 1970s-1980s, where the stock market stagnated and interest rates were high, then your initial cash allocation should be higher, for example, increasing it from 30% to 40% or even 50%. Your cash reserve determines how much risk you can withstand.</li>

<li>Question: When he tries to &ldquo;awaken&rdquo; people around him, he finds two outcomes: one type awakens and starts taking action; the other type realizes they&rsquo;ve been wrong for decades and feels pain and despair. He doesn&rsquo;t know how to help the latter group and worries that awakening them without proper guidance might end up harming them.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: You are right about the &ldquo;systemic scam.&rdquo; Simply &ldquo;awakening&rdquo; someone is very dangerous because they might try to figure things out on their own and end up on the wrong path (like day trading), leading to bankruptcy. The correct approach is systematic education. You should guide them to watch our channel and learn the complete investment system from the beginning. Don&rsquo;t just give them a conclusion; teach them the entire thought process and methodology.</li>

What benefit do you get?&rdquo; She replied that the market is huge, we can&rsquo;t influence the price, and the price increase comes from productivity growth and inflation. She wants to know how James would respond.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: When you buy in doesn&rsquo;t matter. The long-term annualized return of the market (say, over 30-40 years) is relatively constant. The rate of return I have gotten over the past 40 years and the rate of return you will get by investing for the next 40 years have the same expected value. Us encouraging you to buy doesn&rsquo;t make us more money. Everyone&rsquo;s investment is an independent event. The return you get is only related to how long you hold, it has nothing to do with us.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>On Overseas Brokers (like Futu)</strong>: James strongly advises Taiwanese investors against using overseas brokers like Futu. The main risks are: 1. Issues with the Alternative Minimum Tax. 2. High estate taxes (potentially up to 40%). 3. If the investor has an accident, their heirs may not even find this account, and the inheritance process will be extremely difficult.</li>
<li><strong>On Exchange Rates</strong>: Investing is a decades-long endeavor; don&rsquo;t pay attention to short-term currency fluctuations. In the long run, exchange rates will fluctuate within a range and eventually converge to an expected value. Worrying about exchange rates will prevent you from doing anything.</li>
<li><strong>On the Cash Portion</strong>: The &ldquo;cash&rdquo; portion of asset allocation should absolutely not be invested in high-dividend stocks. High-dividend stocks are still stocks, they will fall, and they do not have the stability of cash. Cash should be allocated to truly safe assets like a Money Market Fund or short-term government bonds.</li>
<li><strong>On Other Funds</strong>: A student asked about actively managed funds like the Franklin Technology Fund. James&rsquo;s advice is to stop investing in such funds with high fees and potential redemption restrictions, and just buy 00662 (Taiwan&rsquo;s Nasdaq ETF) directly.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The market has no peak, it will only go higher.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: At the beginning of the session, James emphasized the long-term conviction investors should have, and not to feel fear or try to predict the top just because the market is making new highs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The money you miss out on earning is a permanent loss for your entire life&hellip; Earning less is a tangible loss.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When explaining why one should &ldquo;buy immediately with available cash,&rdquo; James pointed out that opportunity cost is a real and permanent loss, far more terrifying than short-term paper losses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You could have billions and not be able to spend it all, yet you&rsquo;re thinking of moving to a backward place&hellip; (just to save money) that&rsquo;s called having no way out.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When commenting on &ldquo;geographic arbitrage,&rdquo; James sharply pointed out that sacrificing quality of life and moving to an undesirable, cheap area due to financial constraints is not a wise move.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seeing others suffer, it&rsquo;s hard for us to save them&hellip; It&rsquo;s like Jesus, he spoke to someone&hellip; but then the person ran away because they didn&rsquo;t have enough money&hellip; and Jesus had to let go, there was nothing he could do.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: In answering Edwin&rsquo;s question on how to adjust his mindset when facing friends and family he can&rsquo;t help, James used this analogy to explain that all we can do is pass on the information. Whether the other person accepts it is beyond our control, and we must learn to let go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slowly might be faster.
&ndash; Jason</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Jason summarized this philosophical phrase when sharing his experience communicating investment concepts with his family, emphasizing the importance of patience and continuous communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a husband and wife are of one mind, they can break through metal. If they are not&hellip; even if you succeed, she might fly into a rage, &lsquo;You do everything without telling me.&rsquo;
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When commenting on family financial communication, James stressed the extreme importance of spousal consensus, otherwise even successful investments could destroy the family relationship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I said your [insurance policy] doesn&rsquo;t even pay out when it should, and he said, &lsquo;how much premium did you pay?&rsquo;&hellip; Wow, is that what you call insurance?
&ndash; James
Background: Recalling a debate with an insurance professional, James revealed the nature of some insurance products where the &ldquo;payout limit is tied to the premium paid,&rdquo; pointing out the limitations of their protective function.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take that fifteen million to buy insurance, you could have a hundred million&hellip; you only get one million a year&hellip; that&rsquo;s just taking one percent, and you&rsquo;re still smiling happily about it.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Through calculation, James revealed the extremely low rate of return on long-term savings insurance. Compared to investing in the market over the same period, the difference in returns is immense, representing a huge opportunity cost loss.</p>

</h2>
<p>This session once again reinforced the core idea of CLEC&rsquo;s long-term investing: simplify investment decisions and embrace the market&rsquo;s long-term growth. Through the concept of a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; approach, James urged investors to break free from the interference of short-term market noise and to focus on building a robust, personalized asset allocation, always maintaining sufficient cash as the ultimate defense against risk. The Q&amp;A session covered multiple dimensions, from personal mindset adjustments and family financial communication to the analysis of financial products like insurance. Using vivid examples and sharp insights, James exposed many common investment fallacies. The most central takeaway is that investing is a marathon of patience and discipline; taking immediate action and persisting for the long term is far more important than trying to find the perfect timing and valuation.</p>

Choosing the wrong target can lead to slow wealth growth, akin to becoming poorer. Second, it emphasizes the critical importance of financial communication with spouses, parents, and family members on the path to wealth through investment.

This isn&rsquo;t for them to fully understand, but to give them a sense of participation and the right to be informed, building synchronization and trust. For example, casually mention what you bought more of today, what class you attended, or any new ideas you have.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Responsibility</strong>: Communicating from the start to reach a consensus gives both partners a sense of ownership in the decisions. Whether there are profits or losses, you can face them together, avoiding one person bearing all the pressure and getting unappreciated for their efforts. The teacher uses his company management as an example: his subordinates know all the information he does, so responsibilities are shared, and the manager feels no pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Secrets, Honesty is Respect</strong>: There should be no financial secrets from your spouse. Say what&rsquo;s on your mind; this is a form of respect. Making decisions alone, regardless of success or failure, can pose a risk to the family relationship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Communication with Parents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Planning and Gentle Communication</strong>: When parents are approaching retirement age (50s-60s), you should begin discussing future financial and care arrangements. Use a caring tone and examples (like the sudden situations of neighbor Mrs. Chang or Uncle Li) to gradually &ldquo;brainwash&rdquo; them, rather than forcefully demanding management rights.</li>
<li><strong>The Role of Children</strong>: Children who have learned about finance should bravely take on the role of the family CFO (Chief Financial Officer), responsible for financial planning, investment management, and payment systems, while keeping clear accounts and reporting to the family regularly.</li>
<li><strong>Elder Care Trusts</strong>: If parents are not comfortable entrusting their money to a single child, or if the children cannot reach a consensus, consider setting up an &ldquo;Elder Care Trust.&rdquo; The bank would be responsible for management and payments, and some banks even allow specifying investment targets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Practice of Caring for Parents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevention is Better Than Cure</strong>: Care for your parents should start with daily life, paying attention to their &ldquo;eating, drinking, defecating, urinating, and sleeping.&rdquo; Take them for regular health check-ups (for the &ldquo;three highs&rdquo; - high blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar), monitor their vision (e.g., get injections for macular degeneration early, even if you have to pay out-of-pocket), hearing (e.g., get hearing aids from Costco early), knees, and other body &ldquo;parts,&rdquo; intervening at the first sign of a problem.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Sleep</strong>: Understand your parents&rsquo; sleep situation. If they don&rsquo;t sleep well, you can discuss solutions, such as trying Melatonin, and avoid sleeping pills with significant side effects.</li>
<li><strong>Health is the Children&rsquo;s Happiness</strong>: When parents are healthy and can take care of themselves, it is the greatest happiness for their children. Don&rsquo;t wait until they are bedridden to start managing; the family burden will be extremely heavy by then.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Astonishing Long-Term Performance Differences</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>40 years</strong>: QQQ had an annualized return of 14%, while SPY (S&amp;P 500) was only 8.95%—a huge gap.</li>
<li><strong>17 years</strong>: QQQ&rsquo;s annualized return was 15.8%, SPY/VOO/VTI was about 9.6%, while VT (Total World Stock) was a meager 5.7%.</li>
<li><strong>10 years</strong>: QQQ&rsquo;s annualized return was 18.17%, SPY was 11.8%, and VT was only 7.8%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Those who invest in QQQ might become &ldquo;billionaires,&rdquo; those in SPY are &ldquo;wealthy people,&rdquo; and those in VT might become &ldquo;poor people who think they are rich.&rdquo; If the direction is wrong, all effort is wasted.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Correction</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: What if I have already bought SPY, VOO, or VT, especially in the US where I have to pay taxes?</li>
<li><strong>Answer</strong>: You must sell! Pay for past mistakes, pay the tax once, but in return, you get much higher long-term returns in the future. Don&rsquo;t cling to the wrong assets for a lifetime just to save a little on taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Sunk Cost</strong>: It&rsquo;s like finding out the elevator is broken and switching to another one immediately, not stubbornly waiting in the broken one. It&rsquo;s also like realizing a relationship isn&rsquo;t working after five years; you can&rsquo;t continue down the wrong path just because you&rsquo;ve invested five years.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>From Money Anxiety to Magnanimity</strong>: Taking the sharing from student Michael as an example, he used to have anxiety about money because he was afraid of spending it. After getting rich through investing, his life got better and better, but more importantly, his mindset changed. He learned to use money with magnanimity for physical and mental health and family happiness. Letting go of money anxiety can improve relationships with family.</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;C&rdquo; Investment Philosophy</strong>: Aims to eliminate poverty and people&rsquo;s anxiety about money. We should not be slaves to capital, but capitalists. &ldquo;Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right.&rdquo; We should live a worthy life.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation Principles</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash is King</strong>: Keep at least 30% in cash. Cash is the &ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark&rdquo; of investing; it can save your life.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Leverage</strong>: For those who want to use leverage but are afraid of the risk, you can start with a lower Beta (e.g., 0.5-0.7) and gradually get used to it.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy for Young People</strong>: Even with little capital, you must first establish an emergency fund. For example, if you only have 200,000 TWD but your annual living expenses are 300,000 TWD, you cannot invest this 200,000. You should save up the emergency fund first, and then invest the rest.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Based on my mother&rsquo;s experience (she had 6 million TWD prepared when she started needing care at age 80), and considering inflation, one parent might need about 10 million TWD in 20 years. I suggest you start now, saving at least 10,000 TWD per month for your parents, and separately save for your own retirement. More importantly, start paying attention to your parents&rsquo; health now. Take them to the metabolism department for regular check-ups (like blood sugar, cholesterol) and address hearing and vision problems promptly. Prevention is better than cure.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: First, for the account from the job you&rsquo;ve already left, you can do a Rollover into an IRA account, which will allow you to freely invest in QQQ. For your current company&rsquo;s underperforming retirement account, I suggest you stop contributing to it. You should prioritize maxing out your Roth IRA, and put the rest of your money directly into your own Brokerage Account to buy QQQ.</li>

<li>Question: After my sister took the teacher&rsquo;s class, she canceled more than a dozen insurance policies, took out a personal loan, and invested heavily in 00662 (the Taiwanese QQQ equivalent). Our family thinks she&rsquo;s &ldquo;gone off the deep end.&rdquo; Many people around us still advocate for individual stocks. May I ask why the teacher himself switched from investing in individual stocks to exclusively recommending index funds?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I invested in individual stocks for over 30 years. Although my performance was good, after taxes, I didn&rsquo;t truly beat QQQ. More critically, individual stock trading requires real-time buy/sell instructions. For a community of tens of thousands of students like we have now, I cannot provide timely notifications, which would cause losses for everyone. Therefore, abandoning complex individual stock picking, which may not even yield better results in the end, and turning to simple, transparent index investing with excellent long-term returns is the most responsible and effective method for everyone.</li>

<li>Question: The teacher mentioned that wealth will become more concentrated in the future, &ldquo;the big get bigger.&rdquo; In that case, would an ETF like 00757 (FNGS), which is even more concentrated in tech giants, be better than 00662 (QQQ)?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I don&rsquo;t recommend it. The biggest problem with 00757 is its &ldquo;unpredictability.&rdquo; Its stock selection logic is not transparent (why these 10 stocks?), and its volatility is unknown, which makes it impossible for you to do scientific asset allocation. Its performance is not necessarily better than the predictable QLD (00670L, the 2x leveraged QQQ). The so-called &ldquo;mean reversion&rdquo; does not exist between assets of different natures (e.g., apples and oranges don&rsquo;t revert to each other). Instead of investing in a fund you don&rsquo;t understand, it&rsquo;s better to build your own &ldquo;top ten&rdquo; portfolio based on QQQ&rsquo;s holdings, which has a clearer logic.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: No, that&rsquo;s not okay. The problems are: 1. <strong>Taxes</strong>: When your assets grow to tens of millions, you will eventually need the money, and as soon as you sell, you will face high capital gains taxes. 2. <strong>Opportunity Cost</strong>: Keeping your HELOC credit line as cash is a huge waste. You should borrow all the money you can and invest it in the market. Even just buying short-term bonds (like 00865B in Taiwan) for arbitrage is better than letting the money sleep in the bank. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of the debt figure; look at the growth potential of your assets. The market is always at a low point. You must act immediately, right now.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Investment hesitation is the biggest mistake.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: At the beginning of the session, the teacher emphasized that the market doesn&rsquo;t wait when it&rsquo;s rising. The hesitant mentality of not buying whether the market is up or down is the biggest mistake in investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t avoid doing the right thing just to save on taxes.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When answering a student&rsquo;s question about whether to sell SPY/VOO to switch to QQQ, the teacher stressed that even if it means paying taxes, one should decisively correct wrong investment decisions to focus on the correct long-term returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must do a smart rebalance every year with leveraged funds, or you will be wiped out overnight.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When explaining how to hold leveraged ETFs like TQQQ and QLD, the teacher repeatedly emphasized that these products must be managed with an annual &ldquo;smart rebalance&rdquo; to lock in profits and control risk; otherwise, long-term holding could lead to returns diminishing to zero.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;ve read so many books, now put them to use!
&ndash; Teacher James (quoting a general manager)</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When discussing how to learn from history and philosophy, the teacher emphasized that the ultimate purpose of knowledge is practice. If you read the classics, you must think about how to apply them in your life; otherwise, no amount of knowledge is more than just garbage in your head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The market is always at a low point.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When encouraging students to overcome their fear of heights and invest immediately, the teacher pointed out that relative to the future price (e.g., QQQ potentially reaching 50,000 points), any current price should be considered a low point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Explaining the philosophy of C-position investment and financial education, the core of which is to help people break free from money anxiety and live a happy, fulfilling life where they realize their self-worth, rather than being slaves to money.</p>

<p>This session once again reinforced the core strategies and philosophy of C-position investment and financial management. In terms of investment strategy, it irrefutably demonstrated the superiority of QQQ as a core asset through detailed data comparisons, urging students to have the courage to correct past investment mistakes, even if it incurs some tax costs. On the philosophy of life and family relations, the teacher profoundly pointed out that wealth growth must go hand-in-hand with family harmony. The key to achieving this is continuous, honest financial communication built on a foundation of trust. Whether it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;constant chatter&rdquo; sharing between spouses or the patient guidance for parents, the goal is to build a family financial system based on consensus and shared responsibility. Ultimately, the course guides us back to the origin of investing: to use capital as a tool to achieve a happy and meaningful life, free from anxiety about money.</p>

<p>The core theme of this session is <strong>how to unlock the value of real estate through financial instruments, converting fixed assets into liquid capital for investment, thereby achieving exponential wealth growth</strong>. The instructor details two methods, &ldquo;reverse mortgages&rdquo; and &ldquo;investment-type home equity loans,&rdquo; and emphasizes that in Taiwan&rsquo;s low-interest-rate environment, borrowing to invest is a powerful lever for ordinary people to accumulate wealth. At the same time, the course reiterates that future wealth gaps will be primarily determined by the choice of investment vehicles, with those investing in high-tech indexes (like the Nasdaq-100) pulling far ahead of those investing in traditional broad market indexes.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: A friend working in bank lending suggested that the instructor share the concept of &ldquo;reverse mortgages,&rdquo; which is an excellent option for many retirees who have insufficient funds but own a mortgage-free home.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of &ldquo;Investment-Type Home Equity Loans&rdquo;</strong>: For retirees without a stable source of income, applying for an &ldquo;investment-type home equity loan&rdquo; is highly risky.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Suppose you borrow TWD 10 million at a 2.4% annual interest rate, requiring TWD 240,000 in annual interest payments. However, according to our investment principles, you can only safely withdraw 2% of this TWD 10 million asset annually (which is TWD 200,000). Since the interest expense exceeds the usable amount, it results in negative cash flow, which is very risky.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of &ldquo;Reverse Mortgages&rdquo;</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: Individuals who are retired, have no income, are unable to qualify for an investment-type home equity loan, but own a mortgage-free property and have insufficient investment capital to support their retirement.</li>
<li><strong>Core Benefit</strong>: Through a reverse mortgage, you can receive a stable monthly cash flow for living expenses, while your original investment principal of several million or ten million TWD can remain untouched to continue compounding in the market. This is equivalent to &ldquo;borrowing money to live, while letting your own assets continue to grow.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Information from Taiwanese Banks</strong>: The instructor provided information from institutions like Bank of Taiwan for &ldquo;reverse mortgages,&rdquo; with interest rates around 2.2% to 2.6% and loan terms typically up to 30 years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conditions for Investment-Type Home Equity Loans</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Rate</strong>: The current rate for a general investment-type home equity loan is about 2.59%.</li>
<li><strong>Restrictions</strong>: There are requirements on the age of the property and the loan term (e.g., building age + loan term &lt; 60). This could limit young people who buy older, second-hand homes from accessing this service in the future.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: There have been many recent cases in the country where seniors&rsquo; properties were scammed. Fraud groups often target properties that do not have a mortgage lien.</li>
<li><strong>Preventive Measures</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Do Not Cancel the Mortgage Lien</strong>: Even if the mortgage is fully paid off, it is recommended not to go to the land administration office to cancel the bank&rsquo;s mortgage lien. Keeping this registered lien adds a layer of security.</li>
<li><strong>Apply for Two Services</strong>: Children can take their parents to the household registration office to apply for &ldquo;<strong>Advance Notice Registration</strong>&rdquo; (to prevent the property from being arbitrarily transferred or sold) and the &ldquo;<strong>Real-time Land Registry Alert</strong>&rdquo; service (which sends an immediate notification if there are any changes to the property&rsquo;s land registry data).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Case Sharing</strong>: A friend renting a townhouse in the US encountered many problems, such as poor sanitation, high hidden fees (trash disposal fee $80, sewage fee $80), inability to choose utility providers, and non-transparent bills (a fixed charge of over $300 per month), causing the actual monthly expenses to be far higher than the rent.</li>
<li><strong>Instructor&rsquo;s View</strong>: High living costs are a common phenomenon in the United States. Taking himself as an example, his monthly HOA fees plus utilities, internet, etc., amount to over $1,100 before even buying food. He reminds everyone to carefully inspect the property condition and contract terms and to clarify all fees before signing a lease.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Future Wealth Will Be More Concentrated</strong>: Artificial intelligence and digital finance will accelerate the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few companies and individuals. In the future, it could be that 0.1% of the population controls 80% of the wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Choosing the Right Vehicle is Crucial</strong>: Between investing and not investing, your assets will differ by two zeros. For those who invest in indexes, the assets of those who choose the wrong indexes (like VT, VOO, SPY) versus the right one (QQQ) will also differ by two zeros in the future. People investing in high-dividend stocks or SPY may become relatively poor in the future.</li>
<li><strong>The Purpose of Asset Allocation</strong>: The quality of an asset allocation and rebalancing strategy is not determined by the strategy itself, but by <strong>future market conditions</strong>. Since we cannot predict the future, the primary purpose of asset allocation is to <strong>give you peace of mind, enabling you to endure the worst market periods (like a continuous ten-year decline)</strong>, rather than pursuing the highest short-term performance.</li>
<li><strong>On Educating Children</strong>: When facing a child&rsquo;s problem, analyze whether it&rsquo;s a lack of &ldquo;ability&rdquo; or a lack of &ldquo;willingness.&rdquo; A lack of ability requires &ldquo;teaching,&rdquo; while a lack of willingness requires &ldquo;encouragement.&rdquo; Plant good seeds and nurture them with love, companionship, and positive energy.</li>
<li><strong>Become a Capitalist, Free from Money Worries</strong>: By understanding investment and becoming a capitalist, you can free yourself and the next generation from the fear and anxiety of money, achieve generational wealth, and possess the right to be happy.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Seniors in Taiwan are in a pitiful situation now because landlords, fearing that an elderly person might pass away in the property and turn it into a &ldquo;stigmatized property&rdquo; affecting its value, are unwilling to rent to them.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This is actually an excuse by landlords; legally, a natural death does not constitute a stigmatized property. The fundamental problem is poverty. If you become wealthy, you won&rsquo;t have housing problems. The lack of investment and financial literacy education in Taiwan makes it difficult for many people to accumulate wealth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: I bought 00662 at a high point of 93 earlier this year. Even though the US QQQ has reached a new high, my 00662 has not yet broken even because the Taiwan dollar has appreciated. I feel anxious. Should I use a sub-brokerage account to buy the US stock QQQ directly?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: This is a normal phenomenon caused by exchange rates. If you convert the price of QQQ at its peak back then using the higher exchange rate at the time (e.g., 33), you would find that its value in TWD also hasn&rsquo;t reached a new high. It&rsquo;s essentially the same, so there&rsquo;s no need to worry about exchange rates. If you&rsquo;re in Taiwan, just buy 00662 with TWD. Buy whenever you have money, and don&rsquo;t worry about exchange rates or short-term market fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: I have a USD-denominated insurance policy with a 3.5% annualized return that I want to cancel, but I&rsquo;m worried about the unfavorable exchange rate for converting it back to TWD now. This money is for my child. Should I allocate it as 50% 00662 and 50% 00670L (a leveraged ETF)?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: A 3.5% return is too low; you should cancel it decisively. Don&rsquo;t worry about the short-term exchange rate, because after you convert to TWD and buy 00662, the nature of the asset reverts to a USD asset. For a 30-year investment for your child, the simplest and safest way is to buy 100% 00662 and hold it for the long term. If you must include leverage, you can, but you must understand its risks and rebalance properly. Otherwise, simply holding 00662 is better.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He has been following the instructor for nearly two years, and his assets have doubled. He uses a 4-3-3 allocation, holding 30% in cash (about 10 years of living expenses), which makes him completely indifferent to market ups and downs and gives him great peace of mind. He also shared a real-life case of his 72-year-old elder who applied for a &ldquo;reverse mortgage&rdquo;: for a TWD 7 million house, they can receive TWD 17,000 per month for 23 years. He believes this allows the elder to age with dignity and also frees up the children&rsquo;s funds. The filial piety money saved by the children can be invested to create even greater wealth.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This is an excellent sharing. This is the essence of a &ldquo;reverse mortgage.&rdquo; If the children invest the saved TWD 17,000 per month, at a 12% annualized rate of return, it will grow to over TWD 52 million in 30 years. This is equivalent to using a TWD 7 million loan from the bank to create tens of millions in additional wealth—a very smart financial move.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Fubon Bank has a 20-year revolving investment-type home equity loan product. She thinks it&rsquo;s better for young people than a reverse mortgage and suggests everyone look into it.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: There is no capital gains tax in Taiwan. In retirement, will it still be necessary to live off funds from a stock-pledged loan? Can I just sell the bond portion of my asset allocation for expenses?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: You don&rsquo;t have to use a pledged loan, but your wealth will grow much slower. He gives an example: with TWD 50 million in assets, if you sell 2% each year to live on (assuming a 10% rate of return), it will grow to TWD 2.2 billion in 40 years. If you live off a pledged loan and leave the principal untouched (assuming a 12% rate of return), it will grow to TWD 4.6 billion in 40 years—more than double the amount. The risk of pledging is controllable, but the return is enormous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: If I want to withdraw 3% annually, but my total assets are not yet large, should I switch to the less volatile SPY?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: No need. You can achieve this by adjusting the Beta of your asset allocation, for example, by using a 70-30 or 4-2-4 allocation while still holding QQQ, and you can still safely withdraw 3%.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: She discovered that an older colleague&rsquo;s retirement account balance was only one-third of hers. The reason was that the colleague chose a very conservative investment model, which fell less but also grew much less. This made her deeply realize the importance of choosing the right investment vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: She was most shocked to learn about the Pledge Asset Line (PAL) from the instructor and immediately opened one. She believes people should not be afraid of PAL. Compared to taking on a huge mortgage with a small down payment, PAL is a small loan based on a substantial asset foundation, making it much less risky. She compares PAL to a &ldquo;future employer&rdquo;—whenever you need money, you just go and get it. It&rsquo;s very convenient.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: An excellent sharing. This is the core of financial operations. In Taiwan, with such low interest rates, anyone with property must get an investment-type home equity loan or a reverse mortgage. Not borrowing this cheap money is a huge waste. You can only become truly wealthy if you know how to borrow money safely.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: She only discovered the channel this Chinese New Year and immediately took action: paid off her investment-type home equity loan, sold her long-term government bonds, VT, and SPY, and converted everything into 00662. After this session, she decided to immediately research applying for a &ldquo;reverse mortgage.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: She has a &ldquo;mental block&rdquo; about selling her 0050 (Taiwan 50 ETF). She feels that as a Taiwanese person, not holding 0050 means she lacks a &ldquo;sense of participation,&rdquo; and she feels very conflicted.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Emotional matters cannot be measured in money. But from a financial perspective, you should deal with it as soon as possible. He suggests she first go and set up the reverse mortgage. As for pledged loans, she can start by trying a small amount, like pledging TWD 1 million to borrow TWD 100,000 for a trip, just to experience it and gradually develop the habit of &ldquo;borrowing for consumption, letting the principal grow.&rdquo;</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: He just secured a TWD 7.5 million investment-type home equity loan and invested TWD 6 million in 00662. He wants to keep his monthly interest payment around TWD 10,000 and is struggling with a decision: should he use the entire TWD 6 million as his investment base for a 7-3 allocation, or use only TWD 4 million for the allocation and leave the remaining TWD 2 million untouched in the loan account to reduce interest?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: All loan interest should be paid from your salary. The invested TWD 6 million should be managed as a single portfolio. Given that he is still young, he should adopt a more aggressive allocation, such as 5-2-3 or 4-3-3. The cash portion of the allocation (e.g., 30%, which is TWD 1.8 million) should be invested in a high-yield money market fund (like 00865B, with an annualized return of about 4.5%), not left in the non-interest-bearing loan account.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: When rebalancing, if the market drops and I need to add to my leveraged ETF position, should the cash come from the cash position within my brokerage account or be transferred from an external bank account?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: The cash comes from the cash portion of your entire investment portfolio. Ideally, the leveraged fund is in a tax-advantaged account (like an IRA), and the cash for re-buying should also come from the cash position within that same account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: I can start accessing my 401K next year and plan to roll it into an IRA. At that time, living expenses and taxes might strain my cash flow. Should I use a PAL to cover these? What if a major market crash exhausts my PAL limit?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: This is why you keep 30% cash. If a market crash occurs and your brokerage account (where the PAL is) faces a margin call, you should transfer cash (e.g., by selling SWVXX) from your tax-advantaged account like an IRA to the brokerage account as collateral, not transfer stocks. SWVXX has a very high pledge rate (96%), which can effectively boost your collateral value and borrowing capacity. The asset allocation and Beta of your entire investment portfolio (brokerage + IRA) should be calculated and viewed as a whole.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: For a 40-year-old, is it better to spend weekends working a part-time job to earn more money for investment and retire earlier, or to spend more time with family and reading?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Without a doubt, spending time with family is more important. If you earn money slowly, you will definitely become very wealthy. The little extra you earn now you probably won&rsquo;t be able to spend it all in the future. But the time spent with family (especially parents and children) is gone forever once it passes.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: With a US salary income, how can I apply for a loan in Taiwan?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: You can create a cash flow record. The specific method is: regularly remit a sum of money (e.g., USD 10,000) from the US to Bank A&rsquo;s account in Taiwan. Then, make a fixed monthly transfer from Bank A to Bank B&rsquo;s account (e.g., TWD 7,000 or 10,000). After doing this for a period, Bank B will see that you have a stable &ldquo;monthly income&rdquo; record and will be willing to offer you a loan.</li>

<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: This depends on your cash flow situation. If the 2%-3% annual withdrawal from your investment assets is sufficient to cover your living expenses and the monthly mortgage payment, then there&rsquo;s no need to pay off the mortgage early; you can treat it as part of your living expenses. However, if the withdrawn money isn&rsquo;t even enough to live on, you should consider selling some assets to pay off the mortgage or converting the house into a &ldquo;reverse mortgage&rdquo; to improve your cash flow.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>In the future, it could be that 0.1% of the population will control 80% of the world&rsquo;s wealth&hellip; If you buy VT, VOO, SPY, these people will become poor in the future&hellip; Those of you who buy QQQ will have two more zeros in your assets than those people.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view points out the trend of extreme wealth polarization and emphasizes that choosing a high-growth tech index (QQQ) over traditional broad-market indexes is the key determinant of future wealth magnitude.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our performance is not determined by our asset allocation and rebalancing method; it&rsquo;s determined by what the future market will be, which we don&rsquo;t know. Therefore, the main purpose of our asset allocation is to find a state that gives you peace of mind, allowing you to get through the worst of markets.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view clarifies the fundamental purpose of asset allocation—it&rsquo;s for risk management and the investor&rsquo;s psychological comfort, enabling them to stay in the market for the long haul, rather than for predicting and chasing the highest short-term returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just think of the PAL (Pledge Asset Line) as your future employer. Whenever a month is up or anytime you want to get money, you just go to your PAL to get it.
&ndash; Student Puling</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a very vivid metaphor that explains the complex financial tool of &ldquo;pledged loans&rdquo; as a source of cash flow as convenient as receiving a salary, greatly lowering the barrier to understanding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not selling is your ancestor.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>With a humorous and colloquial phrase, the instructor emphasizes the extreme importance of long-term holding and avoiding the sale of assets, subverting the traditional wisdom that &ldquo;knowing when to sell makes you a master.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to get into the habit of borrowing money.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view challenges the traditional &ldquo;debt-free is worry-free&rdquo; concept, emphasizing that in a low-interest-rate environment, learning to use leverage safely and intelligently by borrowing to invest is a crucial habit for accelerating wealth accumulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was born in Taiwan, and if I don&rsquo;t own 0050, it feels like I&rsquo;m not participating. I&rsquo;m just very conflicted internally.
&ndash; Student Lana</p></blockquote>
<p>This sentence genuinely reflects the &ldquo;home bias&rdquo; and emotional factors that influence many investors&rsquo; decisions, serving as a very typical and relatable &ldquo;mental block.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This session reinforces the core investment philosophy of CLEC while introducing more specific wealth-growth strategies. Through the cases of &ldquo;reverse mortgages&rdquo; and &ldquo;investment-type home equity loans,&rdquo; the instructor vividly demonstrated how to unlock seemingly &ldquo;dormant&rdquo; real estate and turn it into fuel for wealth growth. The course not only provided operational guidance but, more importantly, continued to shape the investor&rsquo;s mindset: to break the fear of debt and understand the power of leverage; to abandon focus on short-term fluctuations and concentrate on choosing the right long-term track; and to recognize that the essence of wealth is cognition. Only by continuously improving financial literacy can one stand invincible in the future tide of wealth.</p>

<p>The core theme of this episode is the &ldquo;awakening&rdquo; of the investor. This includes two levels: first, a financial awakening, which means transitioning from a &ldquo;slave&rdquo; working for money to a &ldquo;master&rdquo; who makes money work for them by holding index funds long-term and utilizing the rules of capitalism; second, a philosophical awakening in life, which involves prioritizing health (especially early screening for lung cancer) and breaking free from the constraints of societal expectations and the &ldquo;culture of hardship&rdquo; to pursue true freedom and happiness.</p>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James begins with the experience of a friend&rsquo;s family, strongly urging everyone to prioritize health, especially the early screening for lung cancer.</li>
<li><strong>Core Recommendation</strong>: Friends over 40 in Taiwan should pay for a low-dose computed tomography (Low-Dose CT, LDCT) scan out-of-pocket (around NT$5,000-6,000). Lung cancer is the &ldquo;king of cancers&rdquo; in Taiwan, often asymptomatic in its early stages, but the cure rate is high with early detection.</li>
<li><strong>Screening Frequency</strong>: If the scan is clear, you can do it again every 2-3 years. The latency period for lung adenocarcinoma is relatively long; it might take five years for a tumor to grow from 0.8 cm to 1.6 cm, providing enough time to respond with regular follow-ups.</li>
<li><strong>Added Value</strong>: An LDCT scan can also incidentally check for calcification or blockage in the heart&rsquo;s coronary arteries, serving two purposes at once.</li>
<li><strong>Advice for Overseas Chinese</strong>: For Chinese friends in the United States, since doctors there typically do not order such scans without symptoms, you might consider booking a self-paid health check-up at a teaching hospital in Taiwan a month and a half in advance when you travel back.</li>
<li><strong>Health is Fundamental</strong>: The teacher emphasizes that without health, all wealth is meaningless.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore Currency Fluctuations</strong>: Taking the 00662 fund as an example, although it is a USD-denominated product priced in TWD, its net value is affected by the TWD/USD exchange rate. However, over the long term (e.g., 30 years), the impact of exchange rates will smooth out. Investors should completely ignore currency fluctuations and focus on the growth of the asset itself.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Away from Wrong Products</strong>: Young people should not invest in high-dividend products, as they will only make you poorer. Also, be wary of insurance, annuities, and similar products, which the teacher calls &ldquo;products from a scam syndicate.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Adhere to Index Funds</strong>: It is only recommended to invest in broad-based index funds like the Nasdaq-100 (e.g., QQQ, 00662). Don&rsquo;t be misled by other ETFs on the market that are not true to their name.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Critique of &ldquo;Involution&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hardship&rdquo; Culture</strong>: The prevalent cultures of &ldquo;treating hardship as a tonic&rdquo; and &ldquo;involution&rdquo; in Asian societies lead to an increasingly difficult life for everyone. The teacher advocates for learning from Western thinking, realizing that we are not born to be laborers or slaves.</li>
<li><strong>The Intent Behind the Word &ldquo;Slave&rdquo;</strong>: The teacher deliberately uses the word &ldquo;slave&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;laborer&rdquo; to make the audience uncomfortable and thus spark an awakening. Under modern capitalism, apart from capitalists, most people are essentially &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; serving capital, to be discarded after use.</li>
<li><strong>Breaking Out of Mental Frameworks</strong>: Escaping inherent societal beliefs like &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t have food if you don&rsquo;t work hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;investing is wrong&rdquo; is harder than making the right investment itself. One must resist the negative influence of friends and family and stick to one&rsquo;s own path.</li>
<li><strong>True Freedom</strong>: Financial freedom is just the first step. True freedom is the ability to ignore the judgment of society and others, to grade yourself, and to live the life you want. You decide how you want to spend your money and what kind of life you want to live—that is freedom.</li>
<li><strong>Warning of Survivorship Bias</strong>: The teacher admits that his ability to make money in his first 20 years of speculation was due to &ldquo;heaven&rsquo;s mercy&rdquo; and &ldquo;luck,&rdquo; a case of survivorship bias that is not replicable. He strongly advises against imitating it.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalism and Inequality</strong>: The development of civilization has created information gaps, which are the root of inequality. Capitalism uses information asymmetry to create unfairness, which is essentially plunder. The teacher compares human conflicts to &ldquo;watching two groups of gorillas fighting,&rdquo; illustrating that human civilization has not progressed much in its essence; slavery exists today in a new form and on a larger scale.</li>
<li><strong>A Revolution to Eliminate Poverty</strong>: Teacher James sees his educational sharing as a &ldquo;revolution to eliminate poverty,&rdquo; aimed at awakening the masses to understand the rules of capitalism and transform from exploited &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; to &ldquo;masters&rdquo; who use the rules to their advantage.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation Principles</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Condition for Retirement: Assets reach 50 times annual expenses.</li>
<li>Retirement Allocation: Cash should be at least 30%, enough to cover more than 15 years of annual expenses.</li>
<li>Beta Value: The Beta of the initial allocation should not exceed 1.0.</li>
<li>Leveraged Funds: The position in leveraged funds should not exceed the cash position, nor should it exceed the position in the underlying fund.</li>
<li>Flexible Allocation: Besides the 4-3-3 model, configurations like 70/30, 60/40, and 50/50 are all viable. The key is to find what suits your own risk tolerance and cash flow needs.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>No Shortcuts in Investment Learning</strong>: Investment knowledge requires systematic learning and cannot be achieved overnight. You must connect the scattered &ldquo;dots&rdquo; of knowledge into &ldquo;lines,&rdquo; which then form a &ldquo;surface&rdquo; and a &ldquo;three-dimensional&rdquo; knowledge system through continuous watching of videos (e.g., starting from #398) and note-taking.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Extreme Optimism About the Future of AI</strong>: The teacher believes we are in a golden age. Current technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, and digital finance are at a stage similar to the internet&rsquo;s underlying infrastructure (TCP/IP) in the 1980s; the real application explosion has not yet begun.</li>
<li><strong>The Revolutionary Nature of Agents</strong>: Taking OpenAI&rsquo;s Agent functionality as an example, future AI agents will be able to automatically complete complex tasks like booking tickets, shopping, and planning itineraries. This will disrupt many industries and create entirely new business models and corporate giants.</li>
<li><strong>Expectation of Returns</strong>: Based on this, the teacher believes that the 18% annualized return of the past 20 years may be an underestimation. In the future, 25% or even higher is possible, and it&rsquo;s not out of the question for the market to grow 100-fold in the next 20 years.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Share</strong>: After attending the class in January 2024, I transferred my entire 401k to a brokerage account and invested it all at once. The market was down at the time, and my assets grew from $1.1 million to the current $1.7 million. My current asset allocation is 50% QQQ, 20% TQQQ.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: When I retire, should I convert the TQQQ to QQQ?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The focus isn&rsquo;t on TQQQ. The goal is to get your brokerage account funds to exceed $1 million so you can do stock pledges in the future. Your current tax rate is between 30-33%, so you should immediately start converting funds from your Traditional 401k/IRA to a Roth IRA in batches. Since your assets will be much higher in the future, a one-time conversion would face an extremely high tax bill. It&rsquo;s recommended to convert a portion each year, for example, $100,000 at a time (Note: a student pointed out that at a 30% tax rate, converting $100k would cost $30k in taxes, so be prepared). Strategically, you should place leveraged funds (like TQQQ) in the tax-free Roth account, while leaving cash in the Traditional account to slow its growth.</li>

<li><strong>Share</strong>: I started working at 24 and was fortunate to meet the teacher after 10 years of work. After switching to passive investing, I have much more time, and my assets have grown rapidly. I no longer hesitate about money when it comes to consumption and experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: After a promotion, I have to manage more people, and the pressure has skyrocketed, making me anxious, irritable, and even affecting my interactions with my family. How did you cope with high-pressure management positions back then?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The higher your position, the more relaxed you should be. If you&rsquo;re more tired, it means your management skills are lacking. The key is to learn to delegate and &ldquo;throw the monkeys,&rdquo; meaning you assign tasks to your subordinates to complete, and you only check and guide at critical points. Don&rsquo;t take the pressure from your superiors seriously; treat it as &ldquo;wind in your ears&rdquo; or a &ldquo;dog barking at a train.&rdquo; Your core job is to enhance your subordinates&rsquo; abilities and make them stronger than you, so you can truly &ldquo;work while lying down.&rdquo; When your boss scolds you, take a deep breath; that&rsquo;s his problem, don&rsquo;t let it affect your mood.</li>

<li><strong>Share</strong>: In the US, people with a history of smoking can get a low-dose CT scan (LDCT) covered by medical insurance. I get one every year.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: Can the CT scan you mentioned also detect problems with other organs like the pancreas?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: LDCT mainly targets the lungs. While it can also scan the liver, its effectiveness for pancreatic cancer screening is uncertain. For a full-body cancer cell screening, you need a PET Scan, but it has high radiation and is usually only for diagnosed cancer patients to check for metastasis. It&rsquo;s not recommended for healthy people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: If different asset allocations (like 80/20, 64/36) have the same Beta value (e.g., 0.8), will their expected performance be the same?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Not necessarily. Asset allocation itself doesn&rsquo;t determine performance; future market conditions do. In a rising market, a high-Beta allocation performs well; in a falling market, cash performs best. We do asset allocation to &ldquo;survive&rdquo; safely, not to predict or chase the highest performance.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: In the smart rebalancing strategy, do you ever rebalance the underlying fund (like QQQ)?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Yes, the underlying fund is never touched.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: If the market crashes and then rebounds, and the leveraged fund (like TQQQ) rises for the year but its total asset percentage has not returned to the initially set ratio (e.g., target 30%, now up from 20% to 28%), do I still need to sell one-third of the gains?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: You must sell. If you don&rsquo;t take out cash in a rising year and keep using cash to buy in a falling year, your cash reserves will be depleted quickly. Even if the leveraged fund hasn&rsquo;t returned to its previous high, as long as it has risen for the year, you must take out a portion of the profit (one-third of the gain) to replenish your cash. This is a critical risk control mechanism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: Besides living expenses, buying dips, and margin for pledges, does cash have other uses? I feel like a 30% cash allocation might be too high for me.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: 30% cash corresponds to 15 years of living expenses (calculated at a 2% annual withdrawal rate), which is a robust initial setting. If your pledged loans increase, your cash reserves need to increase accordingly to cover the debt risk. If you have other stable income (like social security, rent), you can continue to invest that income instead of reducing your cash reserve. Maintaining a 15-year cash reserve is a simple and effective strategy.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: I read Professor Chou&rsquo;s book, which mentioned not recommending long-term holding of leveraged ETFs because their value erodes over time and the long-term return is not double. This differs from your view. How should I understand this?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The annualized return of a leveraged fund is indeed not a linear double (e.g., if QQQ has a 10% annualized return, TQQQ might only be 14%), but due to the compounding effect, the total asset growth multiplier after 20 years will be far more than double. The reason Professor Chou doesn&rsquo;t recommend it is that he is addressing the general public and cannot teach complex asset allocation in depth. Holding leveraged funds is indeed very dangerous without asset allocation (i.e., without cash to buy on dips). Our method is built on strict asset allocation, which is the fundamental difference. These things can only be taught in a small, in-depth learning class; if you say this in the mass media, you&rsquo;ll be &ldquo;drowned in saliva.&rdquo;</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: The market is hitting new highs, and I have the impulse to sell some of my QLD to lock in profits and increase cash. Should I do it now or wait until the end of the year?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Wait until the end of the year. The market&rsquo;s gain so far this year is not that large (about 10%). A normal bull year should see a rise of 30% or more. Only when there is a huge deviation (like a 50% annual gain) is there a need to consider adjusting early. Otherwise, just rebalance annually.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Share &amp; Question 2</strong>: I shared a strategy from a research paper, which is to sell leveraged funds when the index falls below the 200-day moving average (MA200) and buy back when it rises above it, claiming it can significantly improve returns. I did my own simulation and it seemed to work well. I&rsquo;d like to hear your thoughts.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This kind of market-timing strategy is useless. First, you&rsquo;ll encounter many &ldquo;whipsaws&rdquo; (false breakouts), leading to losses from selling high and buying low. Second, even if you successfully sell at the top (like in 2000), the biggest problem is when to buy back; human nature makes it very difficult. This operation seems clever, but its actual effect is often worse than the simple and effective &ldquo;hold and buy the dip&rdquo; strategy. We rely on asset allocation and cash reserves, not market timing.</li>

<li><strong>Share</strong>: After listening to the class for one or two months, my mindset has completely changed, from fearing I would &ldquo;outlive my savings&rdquo; to understanding that assets will grow on their own. I have invested 7 million in 513100 (CSI 300 ETF) and have another 3 million in cash.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: I plan to spend 200,000 a year on living expenses and withdraw a large sum from my investments to cover the next 20 years of living expenses when my cash runs down to a two or three-year supply. Is this okay? Also, is the annualized return of investing only in 513100 just 8-10%, lower than a 4-3-3 allocation? Can I retire now?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Your plan is fine; you don&rsquo;t need to rebalance every year. You have 10 million in assets and only spend 200,000 a year, you can absolutely retire. Asset allocation doesn&rsquo;t determine the final performance; the market does. You should retire early and enjoy life. If you haven&rsquo;t had children yet, you should hurry up and have them; that&rsquo;s more important than work.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: I have two children (one in college, one just started working), and they each have over 5 million TWD in assets. Should they invest directly in an underlying fund (00662) or use a 4-3-3 allocation?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: You must allocate cash for them. They are about to become independent and need their own emergency fund. You can&rsquo;t let them rely on their parents for everything. I suggest starting with an 80/20 (underlying/cash) allocation and don&rsquo;t use leveraged funds yet. Once they get used to investing, you can slowly add a small amount of leverage in the future. Don&rsquo;t let them experience large fluctuations from the start, as it might leave them with psychological scars.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: It seems that Taiwan&rsquo;s leveraged fund (00670L) recovers slower than America&rsquo;s QLD. Is there a problem with its management?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is mainly due to the TWD exchange rate and hedging costs. The correct comparison is between 00670L and 00662, as they are both priced in TWD. Historical data shows that the return of 00670L is more than double that of 00662, proving it has met its design objective.</li>

<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: My sister bought many savings-type life insurance policies. She has paid into some for 10 years, and surrendering them now would mean losing all the premiums paid. What should she do?

<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Surrender all of them. You win the moment you stop paying. Don&rsquo;t worry about how much you&rsquo;ve lost, because you still have decades of investing time ahead of you. Even if you only get a small amount back, investing it in an index fund will grow into a huge fortune after 40 years, far exceeding your current losses.</li>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: You used to work at Acer and were also a &ldquo;slave&rdquo; to capitalists. How did you adjust your mindset back then, having to work for capitalists while maintaining a sense of accomplishment?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: I started investing in my second year of work, so I was both a laborer and a capitalist. The key is that you must find a meaning and mission for your work that goes beyond the salary. My mission at that time was to design stable and reliable computers to serve the public. If you work only for a salary, you are a slave. But if you work to serve the public, you have found the meaning of life.</li>

<p><strong>Question 2</strong>: You previously said the annualized return of QQQ is about 14%, but now you mention 18% or even higher. Is this because you believe the future development of AI will surpass the mobile internet wave?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Of course. The annualized return over the past five years has already reached 25%. We are now in the very early stages of the AI and digital finance revolution, like the TCP/IP infrastructure phase of the internet in the 1980s. The real application boom is far from here. The future growth potential is enormous; a 100-fold increase in 20 years is possible.</li>

<p><strong>Question 3</strong>: I have 200,000 in cash, a monthly rental income of 3,000, and a mortgage-free house. How should I invest?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This question is impossible to answer. Asset allocation requires understanding your entire situation: age, family status (single/married/children), total annual expenses, whether you have a sufficient emergency fund, and whether this 200,000 is spare money. Without this information, it&rsquo;s impossible to give responsible advice. If this 200,000 is money you won&rsquo;t touch for 15-20 years and you already have an adequate emergency fund, then you can buy QQQ or 00662 all at once.</li>

<li><strong>Ignore Market Noise</strong>: Teacher James points out that in his 40 years of investing, almost all financial and political news and market analysis have been &ldquo;demons and monsters,&rdquo; useless for long-term investing. He quotes a student&rsquo;s message, emphasizing that social opinions and market volatility are irrelevant to long-term investors; enjoying the tranquility of the present is far more important than focusing on fleeting issues.</li>
<li><strong>The Best Strategy: Buy, Hold, Don&rsquo;t Sell</strong>: This is the core principle throughout. The art of investing lies not in complex market timing or stock picking, but in persistently holding high-quality assets for a lifetime, or even for generations.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Should Be Easy and Simple</strong>: The teacher uses an analogy: investing should only take 5-10 minutes a year and should not be a burden on one&rsquo;s life. If you make investing complicated, it&rsquo;s like adding a lot of chili oil to a simple clear noodle soup, which ruins the original flavor. Investors should spend more time enjoying life and being with their families.</li>

He believes that asking someone else how to allocate your assets is like asking them how much chili to add to your beef noodles because everyone&rsquo;s risk tolerance (how much spice they can handle) is different.
<ul>
<li><strong>Advice for Beginners</strong>: For novices or those unsure of their risk tolerance, the teacher suggests starting with &ldquo;clear-broth beef noodles&rdquo; (a conservative allocation), for example, 50% of assets in the market and 50% in cash.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy for Large Sums of Capital</strong>: It is recommended to divide it into three parts: buy 1/3 immediately, buy 1/3 in batches, and keep 1/3 as cash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Three Elements of Investment Psychology: Steadfastness, Patience, Faith</strong>: Once you have bought in, the next step is to cultivate a strong psychological mindset.
<ul>
<li><strong>Steadfastness</strong>: Not being affected by market fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Patience</strong>: Enduring painful periods of market decline is a necessary psychological quality.</li>
<li><strong>Faith</strong>: Believing in the long-term upward trend of the market is the path to reaching the highest realm of investing.</li>

<li><strong>Cash and Market Volatility are &ldquo;Boosters&rdquo; for Assets</strong>: The teacher uses the concept of a &ldquo;boost converter&rdquo; in electronic circuits as an analogy. Market volatility is like an &ldquo;oscillator,&rdquo; and cash is like the &ldquo;electric current.&rdquo; Investing cash during a market downturn (oscillation) can effectively push asset values to new highs.</li>
<li><strong>Fragile vs. Anti-fragile</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Fragile Investment</strong>: For example, investing 100% in QQQ. If the market goes to zero, your assets go to zero. This is like a flower in a greenhouse that cannot withstand a storm.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-fragile Investment</strong>: For example, holding an index fund while keeping 30% in cash. Even if the market goes to zero, you still have 30% of your assets. This is like wildflowers everywhere, tenacious and able to survive and even thrive in harsh environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>An Anti-fragile Life</strong>: This concept applies not only to investing but also to life. For example, an employee who serves only one company is fragile and can be laid off at any time; whereas an Uber driver is anti-fragile, earning income as long as they drive. In the AI era, a pure software engineer becomes fragile, while experts in various industries who know how to use AI become anti-fragile.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mathematical Explanation of Volatility Decay</strong>: The teacher reveals the characteristic of volatility decay in leveraged ETFs through calculation.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Assume QQQ falls for 45 consecutive days (-1% each day) and then rises for 46 consecutive days (+1% each day), it will eventually hit a new high.</li>
<li><strong>Comparison</strong>: Under the same conditions, if TQQQ falls for 45 consecutive days (-3% each day) and then rises for 46 consecutive days (+3% each day), its final price will still be below the initial starting point, unable to recover its losses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Who is Not Suitable for Leveraged Funds</strong>: Investors who are afraid of downturns and cannot withstand huge volatility should stay away from leveraged funds.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Use of Leveraged Funds</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Position Size Cannot Be Too Large</strong>: Investing a large sum of money into a high proportion of leveraged funds at once is very dangerous. In a long bear market, it could lead to assets going to zero with no chance of recovery.</li>
<li><strong>Suitable for Dollar-Cost Averaging</strong>: For investors with a continuous cash flow (like a monthly salary), making small, regular investments over decades is feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Warning</strong>: For retirees, a high leverage position could send you back to the workforce; for those currently employed, it could postpone your retirement plans indefinitely.</li>

<ol>
<li>A new member from last week, he is very grateful to Teacher James for his quick email response, which solved his problem with the app&rsquo;s operation.</li>
<li>He combines his insights from reading with the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy to create daily reminders for his investment principles: have capital, an investment philosophy, discipline, patience, and luck, combined with the teacher&rsquo;s &ldquo;hear, know, understand, believe, execute, firmly believe.&rdquo;</li>
<li>He quotes a conversation between Warren Buffett and Bill Gates to emphasize the principle of &ldquo;getting rich slowly,&rdquo; believing that patience is the most difficult but most crucial part of investing.</li>
<li>He shares his past principles for selling individual stocks (the reason for buying disappears, the target price is reached, the company faces irreversible difficulties), but now he has found a better option (QQQ) and is liquidating his individual stocks.</li>
<li>Regarding real estate, he believes that a house is also a financial product and proposes a view: &ldquo;Houses aren&rsquo;t bought by people, they&rsquo;re bought by money,&rdquo; with its price driven by market liquidity. He thinks the reason real estate returns are sometimes very high is due to high leverage (e.g., 5x or even 10x). His family owns a jewelry store, and he suggests that high-net-worth individuals can allocate a small amount to gold as a hedge against extreme risks.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: The market is very efficient; this small fee difference is unlikely to bring extra profit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: How to change his parents&rsquo; investment mindset? He details the painful experience of his father suffering severe losses due to high-risk investments and being deceived by relatives. This has led his parents to be extremely risk-averse, preferring to deposit tens of millions of RMB in a bank for a fixed term (with an annual interest rate of only about 1.5%) and refusing to touch any funds. They even believe that real estate is the most secure asset. He feels confused and doesn&rsquo;t know if he should continue to persuade them.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t try to change them. Everyone&rsquo;s &ldquo;psychology of money&rdquo; is shaped by their life experiences. His parents&rsquo; views are &ldquo;correct&rdquo; in their world, a way to protect themselves from further harm. What you should do is manage your own money, invest your own funds, and become a big tree yourself. When you become very wealthy, your parents might see it, but changing them is not your responsibility. The most important thing is to let them live a peaceful and happy life.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>All information is a demon or a monster; in 40 years, no information has ever been useful.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view emphasizes the importance of ignoring short-term market noise and sticking to a long-term investment strategy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asking me how to do your asset allocation is like asking me how much chili to add to your beef noodles.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view vividly illustrates the personalized nature of asset allocation. Everyone&rsquo;s risk tolerance is different, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What our asset allocation needs to achieve is a state of &ldquo;anti-fragility.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view introduces the core concept of &ldquo;anti-fragility,&rdquo; which is to build an investment portfolio that can survive and retain strength even in extreme risk scenarios (like the market going to zero).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to raise a child than to maintain a house.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view reflects on the phenomenon in modern society where people sacrifice their quality of life, and even the desire to have children, for the sake of real estate, emphasizing the importance of life&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He who can buy is a grandson, he who can sell is a father, but he who never sells is a god.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view uses a colloquial analogy to highly praise the ultimate state of investing: &ldquo;hold for the long term, never sell.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Houses aren&rsquo;t bought by people, they&rsquo;re bought by money.
&ndash; Bruce</p></blockquote>
<p>This view points out the essence of the real estate market, whose price fluctuations are primarily driven by monetary liquidity rather than just the housing needs of the population.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t even manage the little bit of money in your hands, then don&rsquo;t go selling your house, and don&rsquo;t go taking out loans.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view advises investors to proceed step by step, starting with small amounts of capital and proving their ability to manage investments well before considering the use of larger-scale funds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investing can cultivate the mind.
&ndash; Jimmy</p></blockquote>
<p>This view highlights another dimension of investing: through the process of managing wealth and dealing with market fluctuations, investors can cultivate their character and achieve inner peace.</p>

<p>This session lucidly explains Teacher James&rsquo;s core investment philosophy and life wisdom. Starting from the simple principle of &ldquo;buy, hold, don&rsquo;t sell,&rdquo; it extends to the sophisticated strategy of using cash to build an &ldquo;anti-fragile&rdquo; portfolio, and then to a profound analysis of the risks of leveraged ETFs, providing investors with a clear guide to action. More importantly, the class transcends purely financial discussion, closely linking investment with personal psychological growth, family happiness, and inner peace. Through vivid analogies and real student cases, the teacher guides everyone to realize that true financial freedom is not just about numerical growth, but about breaking free from fear and anxiety, gaining the ability to control one&rsquo;s life and enjoy the present moment. At the same time, the teacher also reminds students that investment philosophy is constantly evolving and growing, requiring continuous learning and follow-up, otherwise, one becomes like a &ldquo;lost lamb,&rdquo; disconnected from the latest understanding.</p>
