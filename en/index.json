Topic of the Session # The core theme of this session is to emphasize that long-term investors should ignore short-term market volatility and firmly believe in the market\u0026rsquo;s perpetual upward trend. Teacher James points out that having funds out of the market is the biggest risk, and investors should enter the market as soon as possible, adopting a \u0026ldquo;buy whenever you have money, and never sell\u0026rdquo; strategy. By debunking common market prediction indicators (like the Buffett Indicator) and analyzing asset allocation, he aims to help investors build a solid investment mindset to achieve long-term wealth growth.\nII. Briefing Content # Core Investment Philosophy and Market Attitude # Market Volatility Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Concern Me: For long-term investors, daily market fluctuations, global situations, tariff wars, etc., should not influence investment decisions. The market hitting new highs for three consecutive days proves the importance of staying in the market. Being Out of the Market is the Biggest Risk: Many people exit the market fearing a downturn, but waiting for a correction might mean never getting back in. Keeping funds out of the market and missing out on gains is a far greater risk than a short-term decline. Predictions are Useless, Making Money is What Matters: There are many who make correct market predictions, but the ones who actually make money are those who ignore the predictions and stay invested. The Market Always Goes Up: This is the core belief a long-term investor must have. Historical data proves that in the long run, the market only goes up and will always reach new highs. Investors should always be extremely optimistic and face the sun. Review the Past, Preview the Future: The teacher advises students, especially new ones, to watch videos from the market crashes at the end of 2018, March 2020, and in 2022 to learn how to react correctly during times of panic and to mentally prepare for future market volatility. Investment Discipline and Risk Management # No Risk in Long-Term Investing: Looking at a century of history, buying at any point and holding for the long term has always been profitable. However, short-term volatility can be immense, with potential drops of 50% or even 80%, so one must focus on long-term returns. The Nature of Your Funds Dictates Your Investment: Money needed for the short term (like tuition or a down payment for a house) must absolutely not be invested in the stock market; it should be kept as cash. Only long-term funds that you won\u0026rsquo;t touch for 10-20 years are suitable for investment. The Importance of Asset Allocation: Seek Stability Before Returns: Investment allocation should prioritize psychological stability. It is inadvisable for people to switch from an aggressive allocation (e.g., 442) to a conservative one (e.g., 433) when they can\u0026rsquo;t handle the pressure during a market drop (like in April of this year). A Conservative Beta Value: It is recommended that an investor\u0026rsquo;s Beta value not exceed 1.0. If you think you can handle 1.0, it\u0026rsquo;s better to subtract 0.2 and adopt a Beta of 0.8, which might be more suitable. Keep Sufficient Cash: It\u0026rsquo;s advisable to keep at least 30% in cash. For example, a portfolio of 70% QQQ + 30% Cash. Gradual Increase in Leverage: Newcomers to the market can start without using leveraged funds. During a market dip, you can use a small amount of cash (e.g., 2% of assets) to buy a 2x leveraged fund, thereby gradually building a leveraged position and allowing the Beta value to increase naturally as the market rises. This is like riding a smooth, high-class train rather than a bumpy race car. Specific Cases and Myth Debunking # Case: Currency Exchange Impact on 00662 vs. QLD A student asked if the performance of 00662 (Fubon NASDAQ-100) lagged behind QLD due to the appreciation of the Taiwan Dollar (TWD). Teacher\u0026rsquo;s Analysis: Comparisons must be made in the same currency. Assuming the exchange rate was 33 when investing in QQQ and is now 29, the exchange loss is 12%. Over the past 5 years, QLD\u0026rsquo;s performance was about 128%, and 00662\u0026rsquo;s was about 114%. However, after deducting the 12% currency exchange loss from QLD\u0026rsquo;s 128%, its performance becomes about 112%, which is actually lower than 00662\u0026rsquo;s 114%. The conclusion is that their performances are essentially the same; don\u0026rsquo;t be misled by nominal figures in different currencies. Debunking the \u0026ldquo;Buffett Indicator\u0026rdquo; Myth: Many people use the \u0026ldquo;Total Stock Market Capitalization / GDP\u0026rdquo; ratio to judge if the market is overheated, which is wrong. GDP is a flow concept: It only measures the new value added in the current year. Market Cap is a stock concept: It includes the value of all of a company\u0026rsquo;s historical investments and accumulated value. Comparing a changing flow metric to a cumulative stock metric is like comparing apples and oranges; it\u0026rsquo;s completely illogical. Warren Buffett himself rarely mentions this indicator and emphasizes not to use a single indicator to judge the market. Many \u0026ldquo;pundits\u0026rdquo; and bloggers on the market abuse this concept just to get attention, like mindless \u0026ldquo;parrots.\u0026rdquo; Scam Alert and Life Philosophy # Beware of Investment Scams: Teacher James solemnly declares that he provides completely free and voluntary teaching. He will never contact students privately, let alone offer financial services for a 1% fee or any other charge. Anyone who uses his name on platforms like LINE or WeChat to contact you, claiming they can manage your finances for a fee, is a scammer. In the US, it is illegal for an uncertified financial advisor to charge fees. The teacher stresses that no one cares more about your assets than you do; you must manage your investments yourself. Awakening to Capitalism: Teacher James puts forward a sharp point: laborers who go to work in modern society are, in essence, \u0026ldquo;slaves\u0026rdquo; of capitalism. The purpose of his teaching is to awaken everyone\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;capitalist consciousness,\u0026rdquo; to learn to use capitalism to become capitalists, rather than being enslaved by it. (Refer to video 00315) Ultimate Goals in Life: Health and Longevity are Fundamental: Longevity is the path to wealth, and health is the mother of happiness. He reminds everyone to get health check-ups (like CT scans). Happiness is the purpose of life. Wealth is just the icing on the cake. The Principle of Borrowing to Invest: For money borrowed according to proper principles, never think about paying it back. Once you repay the loan, your risk (Beta value) will immediately increase. For example, an investor with 50% cash and 50% QQQ (Beta=0.5) who uses cash to repay a loan will see their Beta value skyrocket, greatly increasing their risk. Having cash on hand gives you the confidence to face risks. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Zhao # Sharing: He is a 65-year-old veteran investor who lost tens of millions in the stock market twice. After starting to learn Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s philosophy after the Chinese New Year, although he had doubts about some points (about 10-15%), he found through deeper study that the teacher\u0026rsquo;s philosophy is continuously refined and has deep logic. Question 1: The market often says, \u0026ldquo;If you miss the best few days of gains, your annualized return will drop significantly.\u0026rdquo; What is the specific definition of this \u0026ldquo;best time for gains\u0026rdquo;? Question 2: Regarding \u0026ldquo;smart rebalancing\u0026rdquo; versus \u0026ldquo;mindless rebalancing,\u0026rdquo; if the market is still rising at the end of the year, will rebalancing then cause one to miss out on subsequent gains? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: On Missing Up Days: This is precisely why it\u0026rsquo;s important \u0026ldquo;not to leave the market.\u0026rdquo; Attempting to time the market will very likely cause you to miss the days with the biggest gains, leading to long-term returns far worse than those of an investor who \u0026ldquo;never sells.\u0026rdquo; On Rebalancing: Attempting \u0026ldquo;smart,\u0026rdquo; irregular rebalancing based on market movements is active investing, which cannot be taught because everyone\u0026rsquo;s judgment criteria are different (add at a 10% drop? or 20%?). This approach can deplete your cash in an extreme market (like a three-year decline), leading to bankruptcy. Therefore, the simplest, safest, and most replicable method is to rebalance once a year. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter that you didn\u0026rsquo;t add more at the low point in April this year, because by the end of the year, your entire portfolio will still have appreciated significantly. Niu Ba # Sharing: Praised the NotebookLM system created by student \u0026ldquo;Chen Feng\u0026rdquo; and the teacher\u0026rsquo;s ChatGPT tool as being very useful. Question 1: For a portfolio of 60% QQQ, 10% QLD, and 30% cash, what is the Beta value? (Teacher\u0026rsquo;s reply: 0.6 + 0.1*2 = 0.8) Question 2: Can one use technical indicators (like the 200-day moving average) to assist in decision-making—becoming conservative when the price is below the average and aggressive when it\u0026rsquo;s above? Question 3: Are people like Apple CEO Tim Cook considered capitalists or laborers? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: On Technical Indicators: Completely unnecessary. In the recent V-shaped recovery, using a 200-day moving average strategy would have had you sell and buy back at roughly the same point. Not only would you not have made a profit, you might have lost money on transaction fees, underperforming a \u0026ldquo;do nothing\u0026rdquo; strategy. On Tim Cook: He is a laborer, a very highly paid \u0026ldquo;slave.\u0026rdquo; His wealth comes from his salary (including stock options), not from returns on his own invested capital. True capitalists do not have to go to work. Inny # Sharing: Influenced by family, she previously invested in real estate. Her property in Japan yielded poor returns due to the yen\u0026rsquo;s major depreciation over the last decade. Shared a success story: she took out a home loan of 8 million TWD four or five years ago and didn\u0026rsquo;t pay it off early. Instead, she invested the funds in ETFs and made a profit of four to five million, deeply understanding the benefits of investing with borrowed money. Question 1: What should she do with the Japanese Yen she holds? Question 2: She has about $200,000 USD in cash (cost basis ~32 TWD/USD) and has already invested $100,000 in US stocks (QQQ/SPY/VT). Now she doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what to do with the remaining cash because she heard the teacher say there are tax issues for Taiwanese people buying US stocks. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Handling the Yen: Immediately, right now, exchange it for TWD and buy 00662. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the exchange rate loss, because the potential return from the stock market is far greater than currency fluctuations. Handling the USD Assets: Again, ignore the exchange rate. For Taiwanese investors, the best approach is to sell the holdings in the US brokerage, transfer the funds back to Taiwan, and buy 00662 with all of it to avoid future estate tax issues. In the long run, the exchange rates for entering and exiting the market will average out, so there\u0026rsquo;s no need for excessive worry. Grace # Question: She is in her 30s, and about 30-40% of her assets are in Bitcoin, with the rest in QQQ. How should she handle the Bitcoin? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Because you are still very young, you can continue to hold the Bitcoin. But do not add any more. All new funds in the future should be invested in QQQ. In the future, Bitcoin might be used as collateral like gold, so you may not need to sell it. At your age, if you persist for the long term, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to have assets worth tens of billions or even hundreds of billions. Ola # Sharing: He is 65 and retired. During the recent downturn, his allocation was too aggressive (Beta 1.1), and he had no cash to add at the bottom. He has now adjusted to a Beta of 0.9 (70% QQQ, 10% QLD, 20% Cash). Question: Is there a mechanical rule for deploying cash during a major market drop? For example, investing one-third of the cash when the market drops 20%? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: This falls under active management. If you must do it, you could consider this: when the market drops 10% (happens almost every year), you can add more once; when it drops 20% (happens every few years), you can add more again. If it continues to fall, you must be very cautious, as it could be a major bear market. At that point, you should switch to a defensive posture, not continue to add. The key is to never run out of cash, and the goal of adding to your position is to maintain your original Beta value (0.9), not to raise it. Wasi # Question: QQQ has hit a new high, but her TQQQ position (about 10% of her portfolio) is still far from its high point. Why is that? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: This is due to the volatility decay characteristic of leveraged ETFs. In volatile and declining markets, the drop in leveraged ETFs will be more than a multiple of the index\u0026rsquo;s drop, and their recovery is also slower. This is why a full position in leveraged funds is not recommended. For those holding leveraged funds, adding to your position during a major market drop can help you break even faster. For those with a salary, you should normally buy QQQ and use your salary to buy TQQQ during major market dips. Lu # Sharing: She shared her observation of the debate in Taiwan between \u0026ldquo;high-dividend ETFs\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;market-cap ETFs,\u0026rdquo; believing that both are good as long as they attract people to participate in the capital market. She shared her learning journey: after diligently listening to the teacher\u0026rsquo;s past courses (especially the videos from the 2022 bear market), her conviction was established, many questions resolved themselves, and she became confident in managing minor \u0026ldquo;variations\u0026rdquo; in her portfolio without needing to ask the teacher about everything. She shared her experience visiting relatives in Thailand and the joy of spending money on experiences. This was because after investing according to the teacher\u0026rsquo;s method, she felt like she had more than enough money, leading to a more relaxed mindset. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: I completely agree. There is no absolute right or wrong in investing and opinions; there\u0026rsquo;s no need to debate. He himself has learned that it\u0026rsquo;s better to understand the reasons behind the other person\u0026rsquo;s viewpoint than to argue. He won\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;burn himself out\u0026rdquo; trying to convince others but rather act as a light, allowing those who are destined to find it themselves. Yao Nian # Question: Regarding children\u0026rsquo;s education, a friend\u0026rsquo;s Chinese-American child was beaten at school for stopping a black classmate from cutting in line. The school handled it poorly due to \u0026ldquo;political correctness.\u0026rdquo; How should we teach our children to protect themselves when facing bullying and injustice, without losing faith in justice? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Safety is always the number one priority. He quoted a police officer\u0026rsquo;s advice: when faced with a violent attack, the first reaction is to run, not to fight back. We must teach our children that defending justice cannot come at the cost of their own physical well-being; we are not martyrs. One can verbally intervene, but if the other person ignores it or shows violent tendencies, one must leave immediately and protect oneself. Society will teach them their lesson; our children don\u0026rsquo;t need to take that risk. IV. Insightful Quotes # Being out of the market is actually the biggest risk. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis point was central to the entire session. The teacher repeatedly emphasized that compared to the risk of a short-term market decline, the risk of investors exiting out of fear and thereby missing out on huge long-term returns is far greater.\nToday\u0026rsquo;s laborers who go to work are like the cotton pickers brought from Africa to America in the past. All who work in factories today are slaves to capitalism. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis is a very sharp and thought-provoking view from the teacher, aimed at awakening people to the nature of capitalism and encouraging them to become capitalists through investment, thereby escaping the status of a \u0026ldquo;laborer.\u0026rdquo;\nLongevity is the path to wealth, happiness is the purpose of life, health is the mother of happiness, and wealth is just the icing on the cake. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThe teacher shared his philosophy of life, emphasizing what is truly important. Wealth is meant to serve a better life, not be the ultimate goal.\nIf someone says, \u0026ldquo;Pay me 1% and I can be your investment advisor\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; that is a scam. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThe teacher directly used the language of scammers as an example to strongly remind all students that anyone impersonating him and offering paid financial advice is a scam, urging everyone to protect their assets.\nYou shouldn\u0026rsquo;t defend justice with your own body; we are not martyrs. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis was the core advice given in response to the question about how a child should face school bullying. He stressed that under any circumstances, personal safety is the highest priority, teaching children to uphold their sense of justice while also learning to protect themselves wisely.\nV. Summary # This session once again stressed the core discipline of long-term investing: ignore short-term market volatility and firmly believe in the market\u0026rsquo;s long-term upward trend. By analyzing asset allocation, the use of leveraged funds, and debunking common myths like the Buffett Indicator, Teacher James pointed out a simple yet effective path to wealth growth. The Q\u0026amp;A session was rich in content, covering profound discussions from specific investment strategies (like rebalancing timing and leveraged fund allocation) to life philosophies (such as dealing with bullying and the nature of capitalism). The central idea of the entire session is that investors should build a strong psychological foundation, focus on controllable investment principles, and simultaneously pursue a life of health, happiness, and longevity, viewing wealth as a tool for a better life, not the ultimate goal.\nDisclaimer: This article is for personal study notes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

I. Main Theme of the Session # This session revolves around \u0026ldquo;The Long-term Practice of Investment Mindset and Asset Allocation.\u0026rdquo; The core message is that investors should cultivate a transcendent mindset of \u0026ldquo;it has nothing to do with me,\u0026rdquo; remaining calm in the face of external factors like international situations and economic data, and firmly believing that the market will trend upwards and reach new highs in the long run. It emphasizes achieving financial freedom through reasonable asset allocation (e.g., Nasdaq 100 index funds combined with ample cash) and passive management, and drawing strength for life and investment from wisdom such as \u0026ldquo;I might be wrong\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;life is worthwhile.\u0026rdquo;\nII. Briefing Content # Investment Mindset and Market Outlook # The Market Irrelevance Theory: Macro factors like international situations, financial reports, economic data, and interest rate decisions have no direct correlation with an individual investor\u0026rsquo;s long-term success. One should adopt a mindset of \u0026ldquo;it all has nothing to do with me.\u0026rdquo; Market volatility is normal and not worth worrying about, as you can\u0026rsquo;t control it anyway. Always Be Extremely Optimistic: Firmly believe that the market will inevitably rise and set new historical highs in the long run. Investing requires patience, and wealth is worth the trouble and the wait. Recommended Books/Films for the Mind: \u0026ldquo;I Might Be Wrong\u0026rdquo; (The Illumination of a Forest Sage): This book recounts the life insights of a man (from Europe, as the teacher recalls) who spent over a decade (perhaps 14 or 16 years) as a monk in a Thai forest. The core takeaway is to tell yourself \u0026ldquo;I might be wrong\u0026rdquo; three times before arguing or getting angry, to calm your mind and self-reflect. It emphasizes practicing the state of \u0026ldquo;no-self\u0026rdquo; and learning to live harmoniously with all kinds of people. \u0026ldquo;Life is Worthwhile\u0026rdquo; (Audiobook): This book contains the professional insights and life experiences of an elderly female Japanese psychiatrist. Through numerous patient cases, it explores how many psychological barriers stem from \u0026ldquo;attachment.\u0026rdquo; Her life experiences (e.g., maintaining a less-than-perfect marriage until her husband passed away in his 70s so that both parents could stand on the stage at their children\u0026rsquo;s weddings) are thought-provoking. The core message is to let go of attachments and appreciate life. The teacher believes that, aside from the somewhat fatalistic view on marriage, the book is very beneficial for one\u0026rsquo;s outlook on life. Boredom is the Highest State: \u0026ldquo;Hold stocks in your hand, but not their prices in your heart.\u0026rdquo; True investing should be boring, requiring only 5 minutes of operation and review each year. If it feels exciting, you\u0026rsquo;re likely speculating or gambling, as if you\u0026rsquo;re in Las Vegas. Coping with Anxiety: Don\u0026rsquo;t create your own troubles in life. If you can handle something, face it and get it done. If you can\u0026rsquo;t, since it\u0026rsquo;s beyond your control, let it go without worry. Asset Allocation and Risk Management # The Importance of Cash is King: For Retirees: It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to hold total assets equivalent to 50 times your annual expenses. Of this, 30% of your assets (equivalent to 15 years of living expenses) should be held in cash or short-term treasury bonds. With 15 years of living expenses in cash, nothing in the world concerns you. For Working Individuals: You usually can\u0026rsquo;t hold 15 years\u0026rsquo; worth of cash. You should continue to save and invest, and the world\u0026rsquo;s affairs also have nothing to do with you. The Ultimate Perspective of Life: In life-or-death moments (like the last day of your life), wealth, stock losses, and asset security become irrelevant. Therefore, don\u0026rsquo;t worry excessively about things you can\u0026rsquo;t control in daily life. Initial Asset Allocation Principles (Pledged Investing): Beta Control: The initial Beta of your asset allocation should not exceed 1.0. For example, a 40% non-leveraged fund (QQQ) + 30% leveraged fund (QLD) + 30% cash (433 allocation) is an aggressive setup. A 40% QQQ + 20% QLD + 40% cash (424 allocation, Beta 0.8) is also a solid choice. Aggressive allocations like 442, where the Beta might exceed 1.2, are not recommended at the beginning. Proportion Limits: The market value of the leveraged fund should not exceed that of the non-leveraged fund, nor should it exceed the cash position. Prudent Choices: Even without using leveraged funds, a pledged allocation like 70% QQQ + 30% cash, or 60% QQQ + 40% cash, can withstand risk tests. Prioritize stability, with returns being secondary. Coping with Extreme Scenarios: This allocation must be able to withstand a market downturn lasting 10 years, like the one in 2000 (in reality, it took about 13-15 years for the market to fully recover and significantly surpass its previous high). The Role of Cash: Cash is key to protecting the safety of your long-term investments (the \u0026ldquo;army\u0026rdquo; of non-leveraged funds and the \u0026ldquo;marines\u0026rdquo; of leveraged funds). The Worst-Case Scenario Principle: Envision the worst possible situation and create a plan to deal with it. Once you have a solution, anxiety will diminish. For example, if you get laid off, the worst case is being unable to find a job for a year. Plan how to prepare funds and how to find a temporary job for cash flow. For disasters beyond your control that you can\u0026rsquo;t prevent (like a nuclear war, as Buffett mentioned, or a meteor hitting Earth), worrying is useless, so let it go. A Long-Term Investor\u0026rsquo;s Perspective: Don\u0026rsquo;t fear market downturns; instead, fear that the market rises too quickly, preventing you from buying enough (like the market\u0026rsquo;s rapid rebound after the tariff war). Downturns are buying opportunities. Resolutely do not sell core assets (like QQQ, 00662). It takes multiple experiences (e.g., 7 major slumps) to learn to buy the dip. You can choose not to buy, but you must never sell. Discipline for Leveraged Investing: A reminder that for leveraged investing, the initial cash allocation must exceed 30% (40% is also fine), with limits on the proportion of leveraged funds and a Beta not exceeding 1.0. This is emphasized because too many people ask the same questions and make allocation mistakes. Spreading and Learning the Investment Philosophy # The Importance of Accompaniment: Investment success isn\u0026rsquo;t just talk; it requires long-term accompaniment and guidance. Teacher James is dedicated to this, hoping to awaken more people to capitalism and that his followers will pass on the philosophy, change the world, and free themselves and those around them from financial worries. Learning Resources: Newcomers are advised to start with videos 00451 \u0026ldquo;An Investment Lecture for Value Investors,\u0026rdquo; 00398, 399, 400, 401, etc., and understand them in the context of the current market. The main recommendation is the Nasdaq 100 index fund (like QQQ), combined with cash or short-term treasury bonds. Relevant handouts and links will be provided on the Clubhouse message board and in the pinned comment on YouTube. Call for Promotion: We hope everyone will subscribe, leave comments, and like our content on all platforms where you find our channel. Subscriptions and likes help promote the videos to a wider audience. Although the click-through rate is not high (about 5.5%), it is still an important way to spread the word. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Ba # Sharing 1: I\u0026rsquo;ve watched every episode this year and find that the Clubhouse platform has the most comprehensive information and links. YouTube Music is also a good experience, but finding consecutive episodes on YouTube can be a bit inconvenient. I hope there could be a central place for all handouts and links shared by the teacher. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: The YouTube channel has playlists, such as the \u0026ldquo;Weekly ClubHouse\u0026rdquo; series which already has 39 entries and can be played in order. There is also a playlist for short videos with 595 clips. Using playlists makes it easy to listen continuously. Question 1: In the smart rebalancing model you mentioned, during an uptrend, 30% of the profits from QLD are moved to SGOV, and during a downtrend, 2% of SGOV is moved to QLD. Is this 2% related to the previously mentioned \u0026ldquo;using 2% of your assets annually for living expenses\u0026rdquo;? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: In smart rebalancing, during an up year, you move 30% of that year\u0026rsquo;s appreciation from the leveraged fund (like QLD) into cash (like SGOV). In a down year, you move 2% of your total assets (equivalent to a portion of living expenses or a planned investment amount) from cash into the leveraged fund. For retirees, the core principle is to ensure your cash reserve can last at least 15 years, because after a market peak, it might take up to 15 years for a non-leveraged fund (QQQ) to have a high probability of doubling. For example, if you start with 50% cash and 50% QQQ, and the market falls for several years while you rebalance, you must ensure the remaining cash can still cover living expenses for (15 years - years passed). A strategy of 70% QQQ + 30% cash, without touching the cash for 15 years, is another option. The key is the \u0026ldquo;15-year cash buffer.\u0026rdquo; Question 2: The total assets of the U.S. are about $200 trillion (200T), with the stock market being about $50T. What comprises the other $150T? Is there an index to track the flow of funds between the stock market and cash? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: The remaining assets include real estate, mineral resources, various physical assets, etc. There is currently no specific public index tracking this kind of macro fund flow. The total assets of the U.S. are enormous and grow substantially each year (e.g., by $20-30T). Its debt (about $36T) is not a major issue relative to its total assets and annual growth, so the public shouldn\u0026rsquo;t worry too much. In comparison, an individual investor\u0026rsquo;s balance sheet risk might be higher. As for the claim that Social Security is going bankrupt, I\u0026rsquo;ve been hearing that for 40 years. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to worry; the U.S. can solve it. The Social Security fund itself is more like a pay-as-you-go system, where contributions from new workers pay for retirees\u0026rsquo; benefits, rather than a massive investment fund. Kevin # Sharing 1: I am an investor from mainland China and also a Christian. Last year, I sold a primary residence and invested the funds. I feel like a steward of money with a responsibility to manage it well. I originally planned to dollar-cost average into USD and have opened an account in Hong Kong. After listening to your classes recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve been deeply moved by your selfless dedication and strongly agree with your investment philosophy. My current plan is to use my wife\u0026rsquo;s and my annual $50,000 foreign exchange quotas to transfer funds to Longbridge Securities and gradually buy assets like QQQ. I\u0026rsquo;ve also bought some 513100 in the domestic A-share market. Our total capital is about 3 million RMB. I plan to deploy most of it in Longbridge Securities within six months, keeping a small portion domestically. Is this a reasonable approach? I considered using HSBC for pledging, but the threshold is high (over 1 million HKD), transferring from Longbridge to HSBC has fees, and HSBC\u0026rsquo;s management fees might be high. I plan to wait until I have enough capital to transfer it to HSBC all at once. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Your approach is reasonable. You can first accumulate assets in Longbridge Securities and then transfer them in one go when your capital reaches HSBC\u0026rsquo;s pledging threshold or when you are ready to pledge. This is more economical. Investors in mainland China generally lack financial literacy; many get hurt after entering the market blindly and then stay away, including Kevin\u0026rsquo;s own wife who suffered losses in the stock market in 2015 due to the wrong philosophy. Sharing 2: I deeply resonate with your sharing on both the \u0026ldquo;technique\u0026rdquo; (术) of investing and the \u0026ldquo;way\u0026rdquo; (道) of life. I also listen to Pastor Stephen Tong\u0026rsquo;s sermons and have many reflections. Thank you for your efforts. You\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned Confucius and Zhuangzi; I was wondering if you\u0026rsquo;ve come across Pastor Tong\u0026rsquo;s sharing on these topics? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Thank you for sharing, Kevin. I haven\u0026rsquo;t specifically listened to Pastor Stephen Tong\u0026rsquo;s sharing, but I maintain an open and learning attitude towards various religious and philosophical thoughts (Christianity, Buddhism, etc.). If it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to me, I\u0026rsquo;ll listen, as I believe all great truths are interconnected. The core of investing is this: we own companies (like the 100 companies represented by QQQ), and we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t sell them easily just because of external opinions on their stock prices (Mr. Market\u0026rsquo;s neurotic quotes). Focus on long-term holding and accumulating shares, just like accumulating real estate, but with better liquidity. Investing should be passive and simple. You only need to spend 5 minutes at the end of the year (e.g., Dec 31st or the market open on Jan 2nd or 3rd) to rebalance once. Avoid emotional trading based on short-term market fluctuations, which will only get you into trouble, like being influenced by Mr. Market and becoming a \u0026ldquo;lunatic\u0026rsquo;s lunatic.\u0026rdquo; Huayin # Question 1: In your Excel model for maintenance margin calculation, are leveraged funds excluded? Is this also the case in Taiwan? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Yes, in the models of U.S. brokerages, leveraged funds usually cannot be used to calculate maintenance margin because they cannot be pledged themselves. If a Taiwanese brokerage allows leveraged funds to be pledged, its risk tolerance would be better, and the calculated maintenance margin might include the leveraged portion. Question 2: My investment journey has been: 0056 (high-dividend) -\u0026gt; 0050 (Taiwan 50) -\u0026gt; 00646 (S\u0026amp;P 500 ETF) -\u0026gt; 00662 (Nasdaq 100 ETF). I recently re-listened to one of your earlier sessions (possibly 00451 or another early one) where you mentioned that if one doesn\u0026rsquo;t have enough money, they could buy 0056 and live off the 4% annual dividend for retirement. Did I misunderstand? It feels like I\u0026rsquo;ve come full circle. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: You didn\u0026rsquo;t mishear. Different strategies apply to different life stages and asset sizes. If you are still relatively young, you can use a 433 (QQQ non-leveraged, QLD leveraged, cash) allocation for aggressive growth. If you are close to retirement and your assets are not enough to support a 2% annual withdrawal (i.e., total assets 50 times your annual expenses)—for example, you need 1 million per year but have less than 50 million, maybe only 30 million—then a less volatile option like 00646 (S\u0026amp;P 500) with a 3% annual withdrawal might be a choice. If your assets are even smaller (e.g., only 20 or 25 million), then a high-dividend ETF like 0056, withdrawing the 4% dividend to supplement your living expenses, is a reluctant but realistic option. The 0056 plan is for special cases of insufficient assets; the mainstream, ideal allocation is still centered around QQQ. Question 3: If I am about to retire and the market happens to be in a major downturn, at a low point in the model, how should I reposition my assets and plan my living expense withdrawals? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: You should base your 2% annual living expense calculation on the total asset value at the market\u0026rsquo;s peak before your retirement. For example, if you had 50 million at the peak and planned to spend 1 million a year. Even if the market then drops for three years and your assets shrink to 25 million, you should still try to maintain your 1 million annual living standard (if your cash reserves allow). Because the market has already been down for several years, the risk is actually lower. You\u0026rsquo;ve passed a three-year window, and you should trust that the market will recover in the coming cycle (15 years minus the years passed). Question 4: I am a Taiwanese investor and I buy 00662 with TWD. If the TWD appreciates significantly in the future, will my assets shrink as a result? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: In the long run (e.g., 20, 30, or even over 40 years), the impact of currency fluctuations tends to approach zero. For instance, the TWD/USD exchange rate has historically fluctuated between 25 and 33. Your buying and selling (or spending) is a continuous process, not a single point in time. So, don\u0026rsquo;t worry too much about currency issues; it\u0026rsquo;s not within our consideration. Question 5: There\u0026rsquo;s a U.S. law (the student mentioned \u0026ldquo;Law 899,\u0026rdquo; possibly referring to FATCA or another tax law for foreigners), will it affect us Taiwanese investors? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: That (usually referring to FATCA, etc.) has little to do with Taiwanese people, so don\u0026rsquo;t worry. It mainly targets countries with unequal tax treaties or reciprocal relationships with the U.S., like some G7 countries in Europe (Germany, France, UK, etc.). Rui # Sharing: Thanks for your previous advice on my work issue; my mindset at work has improved a lot. I recall reading the book \u0026ldquo;I Might Be Wrong\u0026rdquo; (the author is Swedish) and noted down two points: 1. Secular success doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily bring happiness. 2. Focusing on your breath can train your brain. I didn\u0026rsquo;t quite understand it back then. Question 1: With your rich experience and having reached your current level, what do you think ultimate happiness is? Also, there are many methods for practicing breathing now (like in yoga); do you have any specific experience with learning to breathe? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Breathing: It\u0026rsquo;s very simple, just \u0026ldquo;observe your breath\u0026rdquo; (观呼吸). Notice your own inhales and exhales, know that you are breathing. This is observing the breath. Doing so will naturally clear your mind, eliminate distracting thoughts, and enter a state of \u0026ldquo;presence,\u0026rdquo; a relaxed state focused on the now. We often forget we are breathing during the day, which means we are in a tense state. Happiness: Happiness is not determined by secular success or external evaluation. The value of a stock has nothing to do with me. The only thing to focus on is yourself. True happiness comes from within. Practice methods: 1. Observe your breath. 2. Practice introspection (similar to meditation or Christian prayer), empty your mind. 3. Relax your entire body (from head to toe), you can lie down, sit in a chair, or sit cross-legged. 4. Enter a hypnotic state (possible after long practice). 5. In the hypnotic state, give yourself positive affirmations (Re-programming), for example, tell yourself \u0026ldquo;I am happy, I am happy, I am happy,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am wealthy, I am wealthy, I am wealthy,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;All the money in the world is mine, all the money in the world is mine, all the money in the world is mine,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;All the market\u0026rsquo;s money is mine,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;My stocks will always go up, up, up, up, only up and never down.\u0026rdquo; Curve your lips upwards, practice smiling. Happiness needs practice. This is the basic skill of hypnotherapy. I recommend the \u0026ldquo;Rachel\u0026rsquo;s Hypnosis Channel\u0026rdquo; on YouTube, which has many guided sessions for different needs (like improving sleep, increasing wealth, relaxation). Question 2: I previously had some money in Firstrade (about 4 million TWD, 5-6% of my total assets). Recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve heard some concerns about overseas brokerages and plan to wire this money back to Taiwan. My current asset allocation is 433. After this money comes back, should I directly convert it to TWD and buy 00670L (Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s Nasdaq leveraged ETF), or should I use this \u0026ldquo;small amount of money\u0026rdquo; to invest in QLD (since the amount is not large, it won\u0026rsquo;t exceed the 7.5 million TWD tax exemption for overseas income by much)? I want to slightly adjust my overall allocation from 433 to 424. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: As long as your total cash reserve remains above 30%, the market value of your leveraged fund does not exceed your non-leveraged fund or your cash position, and the overall Beta of your portfolio does not exceed 1.0, you can proceed as you wish. Brian # Sharing: I always wanted to be a \u0026ldquo;big shot\u0026rdquo; (senior manager), so I left a large company for a VP role at a small Singaporean firm. My salary doubled, but my workload also doubled. I was basically working 7 days a week, 18 hours a day, with no personal time, not even on Sundays or evenings. What was worse, in my third or fourth week, during a meeting with the company\u0026rsquo;s CTO, he was extremely rude (saying things like \u0026ldquo;a one-year-old child could have made your presentation,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;what did I hire you for?\u0026rdquo;). I was very upset and felt verbally abused. Then I remembered your words and realized it wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth it. I contacted my former boss at the big company (who said, \u0026ldquo;Didn\u0026rsquo;t you say you were going on leave?\u0026rdquo;), and he welcomed me back. I quickly resigned and returned to my old company. Although I\u0026rsquo;m not a \u0026ldquo;big shot,\u0026rdquo; I feel it was the right decision. That one month at the small company was miserable; there was no happiness. It seems more money can\u0026rsquo;t buy happiness. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Brian, you did the absolutely right thing! Cutting your losses in time and leaving an unsuitable environment is crucial. Just as we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t buy or sell based on stock price fluctuations, we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t choose or leave a job solely based on salary. Happiness is priceless, \u0026ldquo;worth a thousand pieces of gold,\u0026rdquo; and far more important than a high salary. When considering a job, the first question to ask is \u0026ldquo;Am I happy?\u0026rdquo; If you\u0026rsquo;re not, you should leave. Happiness is a human right. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t accept anything that makes you unhappy. First, remove external sources of unhappiness, then cultivate inner happiness. Young people should try to work for large companies. They have more resources, better systems, and you can learn more (learn systems, management, learn in a big ocean), and the career paths are broader. If you encounter a bad manager or department in a large company, consider an internal transfer (the manager might be transferred, but a good company will remain), rather than resigning hastily. I myself proactively sought an opportunity to be transferred from Acer Taiwan to the US. L # Question: I am an old student who started following you during the market low in 2002, and you gave me a lot of confidence back then. Recently, there\u0026rsquo;s a trend in our group to share that if you use a large amount of cash from your pledged loan, you should prepare twice the borrowed amount in cash as a buffer. To meet this requirement, I sold some of my QLD to supplement my cash, which brought my Beta down very low. Now, I have a new sum of money coming in. Should I use it to pay back part of the loan, or to buy back the QLD I sold? Cheng Feng\u0026rsquo;s advice was that if you use a large sum of money, you need to adjust the entire portfolio proportionally, including the non-leveraged fund (QQQ). Does this conflict with your frequent advice to \u0026ldquo;never sell the core fund\u0026rdquo;? Also, I think Kate said that new funds coming in shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be used to return to a fixed ratio allocation? I\u0026rsquo;m very confused and feel like I haven\u0026rsquo;t grasped the core idea after following you for so long. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Cheng Feng\u0026rsquo;s understanding is correct. When you \u0026ldquo;borrow and spend\u0026rdquo; a large amount of cash from your pledged account (e.g., 10% or more of your total assets, like borrowing 1 million from a 10 million total asset base), this is a special situation that requires a \u0026ldquo;re-navigation\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;re-positioning\u0026rdquo; of your entire asset allocation. Example and Adjustment Steps: Let\u0026rsquo;s say you originally had 10 million in assets with a 433 allocation: 4 million in QQQ, 3 million in QLD, and 3 million in cash. Now, you need to borrow and spend 1 million for an emergency. For this 1 million loan, you need to set aside an additional 2 million in cash as a risk buffer (because you borrowed 1 million, you prepare 2 million in cash). So, out of your 10 million total assets, 2 million in cash is specifically designated to cover this loan risk. The remaining 8 million (10 million - 2 million) is then allocated according to your target allocation (e.g., 433, or adjusted to a more conservative Beta of 0.8, which corresponds to a certain proportion). Specifically, a 433 allocation for 8 million would be: 3.2M QQQ, 2.4M QLD, 2.4M operational cash. Add the 2M risk buffer, and your total cash is 4.4M. In this case, the leveraged fund is 2.4M, which is 24% of the 10M total assets, contributing a Beta of 0.48; the non-leveraged fund is 3.2M, contributing a Beta of 0.32. The total Beta is 0.8. In this situation, selling a portion of your existing QQQ and QLD proportionally and combining it with your existing cash to create the 2 million risk buffer and the cash needed for the new allocation is a reasonable \u0026ldquo;asset structure adjustment.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s not considered a \u0026ldquo;sale that violates the never-sell principle.\u0026rdquo; New Capital Injection: When you have new funds coming in (like the new capital you mentioned), you can use them to restore your QLD position or to supplement the relevant parts of your \u0026ldquo;re-navigated\u0026rdquo; target allocation (which might be Beta 0.8). Restoring QLD to bring the Beta back to 0.8 is fine; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to go back to 1.0. Kate\u0026rsquo;s Viewpoint: What Kate said about \u0026ldquo;new funds not being used to return to a fixed ratio\u0026rdquo; usually refers to routine, small-scale additions of capital. In that case, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to strictly follow the initial 433 ratio; you can flexibly add to the part you feel needs strengthening the most (e.g., add to cash if it\u0026rsquo;s low, or add to the leveraged position if you want to increase it). This is a different scenario from the \u0026ldquo;re-allocation\u0026rdquo; after a \u0026ldquo;large withdrawal and spending\u0026rdquo; that you described. When a plane is on autopilot, small adjustments are fine. But if the number of passengers changes significantly or the destination changes, you need to re-plan the route and fuel. Conclusion: Under normal autopilot (small fund inflows/outflows or rebalancing due to market fluctuations), the core asset is not easily touched. But when a major event like a large withdrawal for spending occurs, changing the overall risk structure, you need to re-evaluate and adjust the entire allocation. Following for a long time doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee you\u0026rsquo;ve learned well; the key is to learn the core principles. JASON # Sharing: I want to share some risk points about the direct selling (or MLM) industry, as I heard a user mention wanting to return to Taiwan to do direct selling to change their situation. High entry fees: Be wary of these. No substantial product or service: Or the price of the product/service is severely disconnected from its market value (e.g., selling wine from Maotai Town at an exorbitant price; something worth a few hundred sold for thousands). Focus on recruiting downlines, ignoring consumer experience. Different purchase prices for agents at different levels. Promises of quick riches through IPOs, dividends, or stock options: Especially with newly established companies that lure you into buying a lot of inventory at once. Advice for Choosing Direct Selling: Mainland China: Look for companies with a direct selling license issued by the Ministry of Commerce (a total of 88), which are relatively legitimate. There are now many new retail, social e-commerce, and micro-business models whose underlying logic may be similar. US or other regions: Choose companies that have been established for over 10 years, preferably publicly listed ones (financial reports are public and transparent, and can be analyzed). Only about 10% of new companies survive for three to five years; most fail within five years. Long-termism: Even with legitimate direct selling, it requires long-term commitment (at least 5 years). Don\u0026rsquo;t expect to get rich quick. If it feels like a \u0026ldquo;great opportunity\u0026rdquo; for rapid change, there\u0026rsquo;s a high risk of being scammed. Beware of \u0026ldquo;Direct Selling + Insurance\u0026rdquo; models: In the US, services can also be sold via direct selling. The combination of direct selling and insurance requires special caution, as it can be highly deceptive, seeming to offer both income and security. Chinese direct selling law requires physical products and a factory. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: JASON\u0026rsquo;s reminder is excellent; scams are everywhere. Everyone should be wary of messages that demand urgent action (e.g., \u0026ldquo;Your payment of $698 has been successful, please call this number if you have questions\u0026rdquo;), or else your account will be frozen, your package will be lost, or that urge you to pay first. You can use AI tools like ChatGPT to make a preliminary judgment on the authenticity of an email (I once used ChatGPT to verify a DMV email). Remember, nothing is that urgent. Take a deep breath, think calmly, and don\u0026rsquo;t part with your money easily. When people are eager to do something (like get rich), they are more likely to be scammed. I myself had an experience in high school with a summer job scam that cost me 300 TWD; I paid the fee and the person disappeared. IV. Highlights / Key Quotes # The market is truly unrelated to international situations, financial reports, or the economy.

Theme of the Session # The core of this lecture is to emphasize persisting in long-term investment in the Nasdaq 100 index fund, prioritizing risk control and reasonable asset allocation, and maintaining an extremely optimistic investment mindset. Teacher James points out that market volatility is normal; investors should ignore short-term fluctuations, focus on long-term growth, recognize the critical role of cash in asset allocation, and ultimately achieve financial freedom and life\u0026rsquo;s purpose.\nII. Briefing Content # Opening and Investment Mindset # The Market\u0026rsquo;s Normal State: Global situations and market turmoil are normal. Investors should remain calm and not be disturbed by short-term volatility, international affairs, market analysis, financial statements, or economic conditions. Disclaimer: This channel is a pro bono sharing platform and does not constitute investment advice. There are no fees, no alternate accounts, and be wary of scams. Investing involves risk, which you must manage yourself. Relevant links are pinned in the YouTube comments section. Learning Path: Newcomers are advised to start with \u0026ldquo;00451 The One-Dollar Investment Lecture,\u0026rdquo; think independently, and find a method that suits them. Quiet study improves the quality of thought more than joining too many groups. Core Investment Vehicle: Focus on the Nasdaq 100 index fund (like QQQ). Page 10 of the handout provides a selection of related funds worldwide. The videos started in 2018, and there is a complete 2022 course playlist available. Investment Mentality: Always be extremely optimistic, always face the sun; the market will eventually go up. Investing requires patience (ignoring market fluctuations), and financial freedom is worth the wait. Please like, comment, and subscribe on all platforms. Macroeconomics and the Bond Myth # Stablecoins and Short-Term Treasuries: A student asked if the issuance of stablecoins would increase demand for short-term treasuries and lower their interest rates. Teacher James believes short-term treasury rates are tied to the central bank\u0026rsquo;s rates and won\u0026rsquo;t fall significantly because of this. Short-term treasuries are similar to money market funds with low volatility. The central bank\u0026rsquo;s rate is the benchmark; no one would buy a bond with a lower rate. The Trap of Long-Term Bonds: Long-term bond interest is linked to inflation expectations for many years to come, and the interest is fixed. Example: For a 30-year Treasury bond with a 5% coupon rate, if inflation is 3%, the real annualized rate of return (Real IRR) is only 1.94%. In contrast, if short-term rates are 4%, it is far superior to the real return of long-term bonds. The $5 in interest you receive after 30 years will have long been devalued. Conclusion: It is not recommended for individual investors to buy long-term government bonds. Issuing long-term bonds is advantageous for the U.S. Treasury because the long-term interest is close to zero for the issuer (after considering inflation). Even if the central bank\u0026rsquo;s rate is below 2%, buying long-term bonds is not necessarily a good deal. The Treasury has its own issuance plan and won\u0026rsquo;t easily change it due to shifts in the central bank\u0026rsquo;s rates. The idea of issuing 100-year bonds is impractical and tantamount to default. Risk Control and Asset Allocation # Risk Awareness: The first priority in investing is risk control; the world is full of uncertainties (like the conflict in Israel). The Importance of Asset Allocation: Good asset allocation is a \u0026ldquo;master strategy\u0026rdquo; (奇门遁甲), a powerful \u0026ldquo;Army, Navy, and Air Force\u0026rdquo; deployment. Cash: The \u0026ldquo;food and air\u0026rdquo; of asset allocation, the most important part. Sufficient cash prevents market panic. Index Fund: The \u0026ldquo;aircraft carrier\u0026rdquo; of asset allocation. Leveraged Fund: Like the \u0026ldquo;missile force.\u0026rdquo; Stock Pledging: The \u0026ldquo;Transformer\u0026rdquo; of asset allocation. The Courage to Sell a House for Investment: Selling your primary residence to rent and investing the funds in an index is an excellent financial strategy, but it requires a strong mind and the courage to face social judgment (e.g., fear of being told you\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;not doing well\u0026rdquo;). In reality, this is a sign of \u0026ldquo;doing exceptionally well.\u0026rdquo; Investment Concepts and Behavioral Psychology # The Difficulty of Educating Family and Friends: Family and friends would rather trust the annuities and savings insurance (1% return) recommended by bank advisors than accept advice about index funds (10% long-term return), even when presented with spreadsheets. The main reason is the fear of \u0026ldquo;what if it drops?\u0026rdquo; Counter-strategy: First, become a \u0026ldquo;big tree\u0026rdquo; yourself and influence them with your own success. Your words carry little weight when you\u0026rsquo;re insignificant; \u0026ldquo;familiarity breeds contempt\u0026rdquo; (近庙欺神). It\u0026rsquo;s hard to distinguish \u0026ldquo;saints\u0026rdquo; from \u0026ldquo;demons\u0026rdquo; in society. Cognitive Roots of the Wealth Gap: Poverty is often caused by a lack of awareness, not systemic issues. CLEC aims to \u0026ldquo;cure\u0026rdquo; this \u0026ldquo;disease of poverty,\u0026rdquo; but it\u0026rsquo;s very difficult; even family members may not accept it. Some people can\u0026rsquo;t accept good medicine and instead buy things like long-term bonds. The Challenges of Individual Stock Investing: Example: NVIDIA\u0026rsquo;s stock price fluctuates wildly. It was once sold off due to poor sales and excess inventory, then soared because of AI. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult for individual investors to grasp; even if you bought it, you might not have held on for the entire ride. Conclusion: Individual stocks are volatile, information is asymmetric, and they can suddenly be cut in half or go to zero. ETFs provide a more stable way to share in market growth. It\u0026rsquo;s also very hard to stick with a portfolio of mixed-quality individual stocks. The Dangers of Short-Term Trading: Short-term trading is like \u0026ldquo;gambling + drug addiction.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s addictive and leads not only to financial loss but also the loss of family, health, and self, potentially ruining one\u0026rsquo;s entire life. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to become a \u0026ldquo;boy wonder trader.\u0026rdquo; Critique of Chaos in the Financial Industry # Profit Motives of Banks and Insurance Companies: Criticizes post offices and banks for persuading depositors (especially the elderly) to buy annuity insurance, structured notes, and similar products. This is a failure of financial regulators. Regulatory Issues: Believes financial regulators should ensure the separation of savings, insurance, wealth management, and lending to avoid conflicts of interest. American commercial banks (like BofA) don\u0026rsquo;t proactively sell insurance. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Financial Holding Company\u0026rdquo; model is described as an \u0026ldquo;all-encompassing, one-stop-shop scam.\u0026rdquo; Charles Schwab only mentions loan options when a client has a large funding need. The Goal of the Insurance Industry: To convert large amounts of fixed deposits into insurance policies, which is the main objective of the insurance industry, given the huge amount of fixed deposits in Taiwan. The Risk of Mortgaging Property to Buy Insurance: There have been cases where the property mortgage remains, but the insurance policy\u0026rsquo;s value drops to zero, leaving people homeless. These institutions \u0026ldquo;will go as far as making people homeless.\u0026rdquo; Responses to Chat Comments and Additional Remarks (Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s collective response to student comments and personal reflections) # On Publishing a Book/Media Exposure: Teacher James frankly states that if he were to publicly promote his ideas like \u0026ldquo;investing with loans\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;not buying a house,\u0026rdquo; he could violate financial regulations (practicing without a license), offend powerful interest groups (real estate, insurance, finance), and even face cyberbullying and political pressure (being labeled \u0026ldquo;pro-Taiwan independence\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;pro-CCP\u0026rdquo;). He could be \u0026ldquo;torn to shreds\u0026rdquo; or even \u0026ldquo;end up in jail.\u0026rdquo; If he doesn\u0026rsquo;t discuss many of these topics, the teaching loses its meaning. The very people you help might turn around and curse you. Insurance: An insurance policy with a 1.06% annual return is acceptable if it includes protection, but it\u0026rsquo;s generally not recommended. Caring for Parents: Re-emphasizes the loneliness and health risks of elderly people living alone (not taking medicine on time, not measuring blood sugar/pressure, leading to complications like worsening COPD, minor strokes, brain atrophy, mental disorders). Advises children to pay attention and provide companionship early. Even if parents seem self-sufficient, consider arranging for a caregiver early to prevent accidents and ensure a regular routine (medication, diet, avoiding falls). Shares his regret of not returning to Taiwan in time to accompany his mother, who, despite having other children in Taiwan, was not adequately cared for while living alone. Emphasizes that parents\u0026rsquo; health is the children\u0026rsquo;s happiness. A Partner\u0026rsquo;s Investment Philosophy: Accept individual differences. Due to different upbringings and personal experiences (like living through the dot-com and 2008 bubbles), security levels and cognitions vary. Lead by example and influence them gradually with long-term results; don\u0026rsquo;t force it. It\u0026rsquo;s normal for them not to listen to you, just as you may not listen to them. 00662 (Taiwan ETF) Currency Impact: Short-term currency fluctuations are normal. For instance, when the Taiwan dollar depreciated in the previous two years, 00662 outperformed QQQ. In the long run, currency effects tend to cancel each other out. Credit Loans vs. Stock Pledges: Credit loans are relatively independent and safe. Stock pledges are high-risk; a sharp market downturn could trigger a margin call, making it like a \u0026ldquo;loan shark\u0026rdquo; — you have to pay back when they demand it, or you\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;shot dead with one bullet.\u0026rdquo; Brokerage Firms Raising Pledge Rates and Risks: Brokerages like Capital Securities in Taiwan might raise interest rates after a client has borrowed, or even restrict withdrawals (due to limited funding pools), \u0026ldquo;luring you into a trap.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s advisable to prioritize more stable brokerages like Yuanta Securities. Apply for Credit Loans Early: Bank credit policies can change. When you qualify (e.g., with an interest rate below 2%), you should apply early. Seize the opportunity when a bank proactively offers you a loan. Stock Pledging in Hong Kong: HSBC is a good choice, especially for VIP clients with large capital (e.g., over 1 million HKD). HSBC\u0026rsquo;s pledge interest rates are currently low. Friends from Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, etc., who successfully open an account and get a pledge loan from HSBC are welcome to share their experiences. QQQ Compounding: The annualized rate of return (CAGR), according to Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s research, is around 18% (including dividend reinvestment). Repayment of Investment Mortgage: Typically, it\u0026rsquo;s a lump-sum repayment at maturity (10-15 years). By then, you can sell some stocks or use another pledged loan to repay it. You need more than 15 years to ensure profitability. Compound Frequency: Refers to capital gains and dividend reinvestment. Philosophy of Helping Others: There are different levels of helping others. The lowest is for others (hoping for their well-being). The next is for oneself (deriving happiness or meaning from it). The highest is selflessness (helping is a natural act, regardless of for whom, or whether it brings happiness, like the Buddha or Jesus; it\u0026rsquo;s natural ethics). Using helping others to add meaning and happiness to one\u0026rsquo;s own life is actually \u0026ldquo;not right.\u0026rdquo; The highest state is \u0026ldquo;like water flowing without a trace\u0026rdquo; (传过水无痕). III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Kacy # Sharing: An elderly friend, who was once very influential in the market, agrees with Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s index investing philosophy. This elder confessed that his past outsized returns were due to information asymmetry and his influence (manipulating small-cap stocks), which is not replicable for ordinary investors. He believes it\u0026rsquo;s not easy for ordinary people to make money in the market, and index investing is the most correct path. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Index investing not only makes you money but also gives you a \u0026ldquo;life\u0026rdquo; (improves quality of life). Even if you make money from short-term trading, you might lose your life due to constant anxiety (e.g., being unable to take a 15-day vacation with peace of mind). Sharing (Follow-up): Reflecting on her family life, she emphasizes love and companionship for her parents to avoid regrets. She sees Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s actions as \u0026ldquo;dedication\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;charity\u0026rdquo; with a sense of superiority and feels for the misunderstandings he might face. Shares her future plans: to establish a women\u0026rsquo;s financial academy (focusing on female financial awareness, as Chinese women are relatively disadvantaged, and financial independence provides more confidence), volunteer in hospice care (to learn about \u0026ldquo;fasting until death\u0026rdquo; and euthanasia), travel, read, and set up scholarships, reflecting a desire for \u0026ldquo;altruism\u0026rdquo; (influenced by Kazuo Inamori\u0026rsquo;s philosophy of \u0026ldquo;altruism\u0026rdquo;). Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Commends Kacy\u0026rsquo;s practice of accompanying her parents. Shares the joy of his own father, in his 90s, still planning a trip to Korea. Advises that for elderly parents, even if they appear healthy, one should consider arranging for a caregiver early to prevent accidents and ensure a regular routine (medication, diet). Parents\u0026rsquo; health is the children\u0026rsquo;s happiness. If parents have medical needs, like follow-up visits every three months or low-dose lung cancer screenings, they should be supported. Greatly admires Kacy\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;altruistic\u0026rdquo; plans, believing that from a women\u0026rsquo;s financial academy to educating disadvantaged groups, it\u0026rsquo;s all very meaningful. It\u0026rsquo;s right to start planning now. C # Sharing: His mother noticed his mood has become calmer and happier recently. He explained it\u0026rsquo;s because through investing (practicing the teacher\u0026rsquo;s teachings), he has found meaning in life and is confident about his future wealth, no longer worrying about finances. This has led to an internal change from external influences. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Shares his own longing and regrets regarding his mother, how in his youth he failed to fully grasp the loneliness and hardship of an elderly person living alone (e.g., his mother falling while going to the doctor alone, and his own failure to return to Taiwan to be with her). Reminds everyone to care for their parents, especially those living alone, after achieving financial freedom early, to avoid life\u0026rsquo;s regrets. Advises young people to learn from wise elders (like Warren Buffett) to avoid many pitfalls and find a \u0026ldquo;mental coach.\u0026rdquo; Question: Following the teacher\u0026rsquo;s guidance, he used an investment mortgage to invest in 00662. After using a portion of the funds from high-dividend ETFs to pay the monthly interest, there\u0026rsquo;s still a surplus each month. Should he invest this in 00865 (short-term bond/cash-like ETF) or continue buying fractional shares of 00662? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Continue buying 00662. The emergency fund (00865) only needs to be built up to a certain level (e.g., 2-3 years of living expenses for someone employed). Any excess funds should be invested in growth assets. IM # Sharing 1: Recalls entering the market in 2018, with emotions fluctuating with the market, having once lost 50%. A wise friend enlightened her (\u0026ldquo;Save money when you\u0026rsquo;re making it, and just wait it out when it\u0026rsquo;s down\u0026rdquo;), teaching her to remain calm through ups and downs and become numb to the market. Mentions how wealthy people view money (a piece of clothing costs 500-600k; money is like trash to them). Grateful for the teacher\u0026rsquo;s guidance that has \u0026ldquo;filled her head.\u0026rdquo; Sharing 2: Has come to understand the teacher\u0026rsquo;s mindset that \u0026ldquo;all sharing is for self-fulfillment, not for rewards.\u0026rdquo; When sharing investment ideas with others, she encounters different reactions: some (who have worked for 20-30 years and are set in their ways) cling to old concepts, while others, despite living in hardship (a single mother working two jobs), are willing to listen. Through sharing, she has also gained a sense of value by giving back the knowledge she has learned. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: (Regarding Sharing 2) Helping others can bring happiness, but the highest state is to be \u0026ldquo;unaffected by helping,\u0026rdquo; meaning helping others is a natural act, not for happiness, not for self. The lowest level is \u0026ldquo;for others,\u0026rdquo; i.e., for their benefit; the second level is \u0026ldquo;for oneself,\u0026rdquo; i.e., achieving self-actualization through helping (the teacher admits his own teaching is to find value in retirement); the highest is \u0026ldquo;selflessness,\u0026rdquo; where even the thought of \u0026ldquo;for myself\u0026rdquo; is gone. Question: After sharing investment concepts with friends, how can she determine if they truly understand? Are there any questions to ask to test them? (Friends listen and think it\u0026rsquo;s logical but can\u0026rsquo;t articulate it themselves.) Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Response: It\u0026rsquo;s hard to judge with simple questions. True understanding is reflected in action (like opening an account to invest). A more effective way is like how Frank guided him back in the day (meeting for dinner every week, hand-holding him through opening an account, starting with a $200 Mutual Fund), guiding them step-by-step to open an account, make their first investment, and follow up continuously. This is a process of \u0026ldquo;sowing seeds\u0026rdquo;; whether and when they sprout is unknown. He himself was \u0026ldquo;led by the hand\u0026rdquo; by Frank to get started. Now, he is willing to be such a guide, with the Bodhisattva spirit of \u0026ldquo;If I don\u0026rsquo;t descend into hell, who will?\u0026rdquo; Man # Sharing: Gained insights from gardening. Individual Differences: The same seeds planted result in different flowers, just as people receive information differently. Their internal \u0026ldquo;genes\u0026rdquo; determine their level of acceptance and reaction (some \u0026ldquo;get it,\u0026rdquo; others \u0026ldquo;laugh it off\u0026rdquo;). The gardener (the sharer) cannot change the seed\u0026rsquo;s nature. Patient Guidance: A good gardener will loosen the soil and water, helping it grow, just as a mentor guides students to open accounts and invest. Inner Joy: The pleasure derived from tilling the soil and weeding surpasses the rewards of all fame and fortune. This effort is not for a return but for self-actualization. Practical Example: She once guided a friend to buy QQQ. The friend sold during a dip and missed the subsequent 45% gain. She only sent a screenshot and said no more, believing it was also \u0026ldquo;fate.\u0026rdquo; Translating for the Elderly at a Doctor\u0026rsquo;s Visit: Shares her experience as a volunteer translator for the elderly, realizing their immense need in medical communication. Such small acts can bring great help and a ray of light into their lives. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Agrees with the views on \u0026ldquo;destiny\u0026rdquo; and intrinsic motivation. Shares his own experience of planting tomatoes, where three seeds grew very differently; one was a \u0026ldquo;chosen seedling\u0026rdquo; and very robust, while others were \u0026ldquo;sickly.\u0026rdquo; Cites Dr. Yang Ding-I\u0026rsquo;s view to \u0026ldquo;look inward.\u0026rdquo; For people you can\u0026rsquo;t change, don\u0026rsquo;t force it. Be yourself, don\u0026rsquo;t be discouraged by it; giving up is an option. Affirms the value of her volunteer work. Sifei # Sharing: Came into contact with CLEC in 2024 through a friend (who had mentioned it 5 years ago, but she was indifferent at the time). In her 50s, she has been interested in investing since graduating from college and has been exploring on her own for years. She was deeply moved after listening to the lectures and has invested a lot of time in studying (finished the 2021-2022 courses and is now re-listening). She shared it with a hundred people, and only two took action, but she still feels gratified. Question: Regarding the choice between a credit loan and a stock pledge in Taiwan. She leans towards using the stock pledge first (2.56% interest, no principal repayment, only interest), because of its convenience. She thinks she can use a credit loan (already approved for a 3 million TWD limit, but requires installment repayments) as a backup if the stock market crashes. She believes her job is stable (banks are always begging her to take out loans), so she\u0026rsquo;s not afraid of unemployment and can access the credit loan anytime. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Response: (In a firm tone, repeatedly emphasizing) Absolutely do not do this! Core Principle: Money borrowed from a stock pledge must not be reinvested in the stock market. It can only be used for living expenses or to repay other loans. This is \u0026ldquo;the first thing.\u0026rdquo; Huge Risk: When the market crashes, banks may tighten credit (\u0026ldquo;take away the umbrella in the rain\u0026rdquo;), and you might not be able to borrow money then. If you lose your job at the same time, it\u0026rsquo;s even more impossible. A credit loan is not something you can just \u0026ldquo;hold there\u0026rdquo; forever. Deploy All Troops (韩信点兵): All available \u0026ldquo;forces\u0026rdquo; (including the credit loan) should be deployed to the \u0026ldquo;battlefield\u0026rdquo; (investment) as early as possible. The Correct Approach: You should first take out the credit loan (e.g., 3 million TWD) and invest it in the market. The monthly loan repayments can be paid using funds from a low-interest stock pledge. This way, the principal continues to work in the market, and your personal salary can also be invested. Don\u0026rsquo;t take a huge risk just because you\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;too lazy to repay the principal\u0026rdquo; or tempted by the short-term convenience of a pledge. Safety of Credit Loans: A credit loan is a relatively safe form of leverage, not directly linked to market fluctuations, and you won\u0026rsquo;t get a margin call. With a stock pledge, even if you only borrow 10% (e.g., pledging 1 million from a 10 million asset portfolio—the teacher thinks 10% is already a huge risk, let alone the 2-3 million she wants to borrow), you could face risks in an extreme market downturn. Brokerage Risk: Some brokerages in Taiwan (like Capital Securities) may change their pledge interest rates, and their limited funding pools might prevent you from withdrawing funds as needed. (Kacy and other students also chimed in, emphasizing the risk of banks \u0026ldquo;taking away the umbrella in the rain\u0026rdquo; and the fundamental difference between credit loans and pledges, and that pledged money cannot be used to buy more stocks).

Summary # In this session, Teacher James systematically re-emphasized his core investment philosophy: consistently buy and hold the Nasdaq 100 index fund, fearless of short-term market volatility. He focused on analyzing the extreme importance of risk control, viewing reasonable asset allocation (especially an adequate cash reserve) as the cornerstone of investment success. Through specific examples, the teacher revealed the investment value trap of long-term bonds and severely criticized certain misleading and detrimental practices in the financial industry, especially warning investors against low-return products like annuities and savings insurance. At the same time, he pointed out the huge uncertainty of individual stock investing and the destructive nature of short-term trading. During the Q\u0026amp;A session, students actively shared their insights and confusions from their investment practices, family communication, and personal growth. Teacher James not only provided specific investment advice (such as the correct use and risk perception of credit loans versus stock pledges) but also guided students from a life philosophy perspective to reflect on the meaning of wealth, work, family, and personal value, encouraging everyone on the path to financial freedom to continuously enhance their cognition, maintain a positive mindset, pay attention to family and social responsibilities, and ultimately give back to society.\nDisclaimer: This article is for personal study notes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Topic of This Session # This session revolves around the optimistic outlook for the investment market, driven by advancements in high-tech development and corporate profitability. The core viewpoint is that investors should remain extremely optimistic, invest long-term in funds like the Nasdaq-100 Index Fund (QQQ), and implement a reasonable asset allocation based on their personal circumstances to achieve wealth growth and inner peace. Additionally, it delves into the connection between life philosophy and investment mentality, as well as the potential impact of emerging financial tools like stablecoins.\nII. Briefing Content # Opening and Core Philosophy # Market Optimism: Teacher James believes that despite market fluctuations, the global situation and the overall market are trending positively. Technology is advancing, corporate earnings are improving, and humanity will naturally solve problems. Investors need not worry excessively about short-term volatility; the market will soon reach new highs. Educational Purpose: The channel\u0026rsquo;s content is for reference and educational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. It aims to spread correct investment philosophies to help everyone eliminate poverty. Learning Resources: New friends are advised to start learning from episode 451 and refer to foundational value investing lectures like 398 and 288. The lecture notes are pinned in the comment section. Investment Principle: Although investing in index funds is simple, knowledge is a guiding light. A deep understanding is necessary to avoid \u0026ldquo;walking blindly all the way.\u0026rdquo; Safety Reminder: Be wary of scams. Do not transfer funds to anyone, including financial advisors. Teacher James does not manage assets for clients. Global Nasdaq-100 Index Funds: Related products are available worldwide. A list and links to global information are on page nine of the lecture notes. Investor\u0026rsquo;s Mindset: Always be extremely optimistic, believe in the long-term upward trend of the market, and endure volatility to reap rewards. New Developments in Taiwanese Financial Products # Ten-Year Personal Loan: A friend reported that KGI Bank in Taiwan does offer personal loans with terms as long as 10 years. Combined with a revolving credit line, the limit can reach NT$10 million (depending on individual salary). If demand increases, other banks may follow suit. Investing and Inner Peace # Pursuing Inner Peace: Investing is not just about pursuing wealth, but also about seeking inner peace. One should not let market ups and downs disturb one\u0026rsquo;s emotions. Rational Approach: Both life and investing require a rational attitude. If your investments make you anxious, it may indicate a flaw in your strategy. Importance of Long-Term Investing: To achieve peace of mind, choose long-term index investing. This allows you to avoid constantly watching the market and prevents your life and family from being disrupted by market volatility. Health Warning: Constantly monitoring the market can lead to macular degeneration, especially for older individuals. Asset Allocation and Risk Management # Solid Returns with Beta 0.5: Even with just 50% in QQQ (Beta 0.5) and 50% in cash (e.g., a money market fund with a hypothetical 4% return), the long-term annualized return can be substantial (e.g., 0.5 * 4% + 0.5 * 14% = 9%). Asset Allocation for Retirees: Retirees with sufficient funds should prioritize stability over maximum returns. Suggested allocations: 70% QQQ + 30% cash; 60% QQQ + 40% cash; or 50% QQQ + 50% cash. Keep at least 30% in cash as a stabilizing force. Rebalancing Considerations: If you have sufficient cash flow and reserves, there\u0026rsquo;s no need to actively rebalance. Let QQQ grow through compounding. If reserves are insufficient, sell a portion of QQQ when it has significant gains to increase your cash reserves. Retirees can set aside 15 years of living expenses in cash and invest the rest in QQQ. When the cash is used up, withdraw half of the QQQ holdings into cash, and repeat the process. Asset Allocation for Young People: Set aside a 1-2 year emergency fund and prepare for children\u0026rsquo;s tuition. The remaining funds can be fully invested in QQQ. Start conservatively when first entering the market and gradually increase your risk tolerance. CLC Beef Noodle Soup Analogy: Investment strategies are like beef noodle soup: there\u0026rsquo;s clear broth, mild, spicy, and extra spicy. Investors can choose based on their risk appetite, but the goal is to avoid \u0026ldquo;getting an upset stomach\u0026rdquo; (suffering unbearable losses). Philosophy of Life and Investment Wisdom # \u0026ldquo;Life is hard enough without feelings; feelings make life even harder\u0026rdquo;: Replace \u0026ldquo;feelings\u0026rdquo; (情) with \u0026ldquo;human nature\u0026rdquo; (人性), and the saying becomes: \u0026ldquo;Human nature makes the stock market even harder.\u0026rdquo; To succeed in investing, you must train yourself to overcome the emotional weaknesses of human nature, achieving a state of \u0026ldquo;indifference to the market and money,\u0026rdquo; feeling nothing about gains or losses. Separation of Tasks: Distinguish between your own tasks and others\u0026rsquo; tasks. For example, a child\u0026rsquo;s education is the parents\u0026rsquo; task and should not be overly interfered with by grandparents. Live in the Present, No Regrets: \u0026ldquo;Looking back on life, there is neither wind, nor rain, nor clear skies.\u0026rdquo; What matters is the present moment; have no regrets. Investment Mindset and Action Strategy # Correct Mistakes Promptly: If an initial investment strategy was wrong and led to losses, change it immediately rather than waiting to break even. The latter is a gambler\u0026rsquo;s mentality. The Importance of Direction: Effort is meaningful only when the direction is correct. The right direction is proper asset allocation, index investing, and maintaining sufficient cash. Risk Awareness and Control: First, understand the risks (e.g., the market could drop 85% and stay there for 10 years). Then, control the risk through asset allocation (cash is a critical line of defense, like the air force and supplies in a battle). Buying Strategy: The best option is to buy immediately when you have the money. If buying in installments, do so at predetermined times and at the market price, regardless of market ups and downs. \u0026ldquo;He who buys is an apprentice; he who holds on for dear life is the master.\u0026rdquo; The Wisdom of Borrowing: \u0026ldquo;Money is only yours when it\u0026rsquo;s in your pocket.\u0026rdquo; In low-interest-rate regions (like Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China), borrow money to invest. Use leverage to let \u0026ldquo;other people\u0026rsquo;s chickens lay eggs for you\u0026rdquo; (generate returns with borrowed money) while your own \u0026ldquo;chickens\u0026rdquo; (assets) continue to grow. Social security benefits and the like should be claimed as early as possible. Individualized Advice: Teacher James emphasizes that his investment advice is a \u0026ldquo;unique\u0026rdquo; prescription for each person, tailored to their individual circumstances. There is no one-size-fits-all \u0026ldquo;standard answer.\u0026rdquo; For example, buying immediately at market price is ideal but not suitable for those with low psychological tolerance. A Beta of 1.0 or a 442 strategy (40% cash, 40% index, 20% leveraged index) offers high returns but also high risk. A Beta above 0.5 is enough to become wealthy. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Michel # Sharing: Successfully applied for a \u0026ldquo;home equity line of credit\u0026rdquo; in Taiwan with a limit of over NT$10 million, an interest rate of about 2.4%, and an interest-only period of 2 years, extendable once to 4 years. After 4 years, it can be converted to an \u0026ldquo;overdraft account,\u0026rdquo; where you only pay interest (rate around 2.5%) and can use the principal indefinitely. Plans to start investing next week according to the teacher\u0026rsquo;s 4-3-3 allocation (40% cash, 30% QQQ, 30% leveraged QQQ. Michel\u0026rsquo;s understanding might differ slightly from the teacher\u0026rsquo;s later clarification, which defined 433 as 40% cash, 30% index, 30% leveraged index). Although he missed the lower entry points, he has come to realize that looking back 20 years from now, today\u0026rsquo;s prices will all seem sweet. Thanks the teacher for expanding his cognition and giving him the courage to use financial weapons. The bank\u0026rsquo;s review process was strict, so getting the loan means the bank also considers the risk manageable. His wife being an employee of a listed company might have helped. He used to think he should never be in debt, but his perspective has now changed. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: The fact that the bank dared to lend to you means they have assessed the risk. The low interest rates in Taiwan are a great opportunity. The current price of QQQ (e.g., $70-80) makes little difference in the long run (e.g., when it reaches $80,000 in the future). He encourages buying as soon as possible. Investing with borrowed money is a capitalist awakening, not a rebellious act. DP # Question: The teacher recently discussed technical analysis on other platforms to guide people towards long-term investing. Could he briefly explain the differences, pros, and cons of short-term technical analysis versus long-term investing for new students? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: He respects short-term traders and their philosophies. He used to trade that way himself with good results (but emphasizes it\u0026rsquo;s not for everyone). He compares short-term trading to being a race car driver, with its specific scenarios and risks. Sharing his technical analysis experience is a way to offer them some help or an alternative perspective (long-term investing), not to change them. He is practicing how to communicate with people of different viewpoints, as if talking to his 25-year-old self. He himself does not trade short-term now and does not recommend it to his students. The technical analysis he refers to is very short-term (determining long/short based on a single candlestick). He admires the focus and effort of short-term traders. IAM # Sharing 1: Explained investing to a 14-year-old from a poor family. He used analogies (Is today better than five years ago? Is this generation better off than our parents\u0026rsquo;? Will the future be even better? Farmland evolving from growing bananas to oil palms to durians to solar panels, constantly seeking higher returns) to illustrate that QQQ automatically weeds out the weak and keeps the strong, just like how the \u0026ldquo;fertile field\u0026rdquo; of American high-tech is constantly being optimized. The boy\u0026rsquo;s eyes filled with hope when he saw how 50 Malaysian Ringgit could become tens of millions through decades of compounding. IAM feels that 80-90% of people around him don\u0026rsquo;t understand QQQ and will persist in sharing one-on-one. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: (Mentioned later when answering IAM\u0026rsquo;s question) Being able to plant the seed of wealth for a young person is to save a person, a family. It is a wonderful thing. Question 1: Regarding asset allocation (e.g., 442, 433, 631), after doing his own homework, he found that risk tolerance is closely related to one\u0026rsquo;s personal life situation (work, consumption). He asks the teacher to confirm if asset allocation should be strictly by percentage, or if the proportion of leveraged funds should not exceed the cash or original capital. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Strategies like 433 (40% cash, 30% index fund, 30% leveraged fund) or 442 (40% cash, 40% index, 20% leveraged index) aim to raise the Beta to 1.0 using leverage while maintaining the safety of cash, thereby hoping not to lose out on market returns. This is the highest-risk allocation that passed simulations, like a plane pulling up just after scraping the ground—highly efficient. But it\u0026rsquo;s not the only option; for example, 50% QQQ + 50% cash used as collateral also works. For retirees, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to keep Beta below 0.8, have at least 30% cash, and the leveraged fund portion should not exceed the cash or original capital—the lower the better, or even none at all. Beta should not be lower than 0.5. Question 2: How exactly does QQQ\u0026rsquo;s mechanism of \u0026ldquo;weeding out the weak\u0026rdquo; work? Is it based on market capitalization comparison or a standard like outperforming the SPY? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: QQQ selects the top 100 non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq, ranked by market capitalization. Market Cap = Stock Price × Shares Outstanding. If a company performs poorly, its stock price falls, and its market cap drops out of the top 100, it gets removed. This has nothing to do with whether the company is profitable (e.g., Amazon and Tesla were included in their early, unprofitable days due to their large market caps). The S\u0026amp;P 500, on the other hand, has other criteria like profitability. QQQ selects the top 100, while SPY selects the top 500; a more elite group (QQQ) will generally have better average performance. The Dow Jones 30 is an even older index construction method. Hao Qing # Question: He is confused about stablecoins (fiat-backed, commodity-backed, crypto-backed). The original purpose of cryptocurrency was decentralization, but stablecoins seem centralized, even managed by governments. What is their purpose? Why not just invest in fiat currencies, commodities, or the US dollar directly? Can stablecoins appreciate in value? What is their real use? Is there an arbitrage opportunity like the one between TSMC\u0026rsquo;s ADR (TSM) and its Taiwan stock (2330)? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: TSMC Price Difference: It\u0026rsquo;s normal for the same asset to have different prices in different markets (US ADR vs. local Taiwan stock), just as the same product has different prices in different stores, determined by market supply and demand. Core Value of Stablecoins: It mainly lies in transaction efficiency. Digital currency transfers are nearly instantaneous and global, whereas cross-border fiat transfers take days. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC): Europe, China, and others are developing CBDCs to improve the circulation efficiency of their own currencies. China is also promoting CIPS to bypass SWIFT. US Shift in Attitude Towards Stablecoins: The US initially suppressed digital currencies (e.g., dealing with Binance\u0026rsquo;s CZ, certain crypto-related banks). However, after the Trump administration, it realized that the dollar\u0026rsquo;s status could be challenged by highly efficient digital currencies. It then shifted to embracing and regulating existing private stablecoin issuers (like Circle), bringing them under supervision through measures like the \u0026ldquo;Genius Act\u0026rdquo; (likely a colloquial term for a stablecoin regulation bill) to maintain the dollar\u0026rsquo;s dominance in the digital sphere. Stablecoins Do Not Appreciate: Stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) are pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Their reserves consist of equivalent amounts of short-term US Treasury bills and cash. Issuers profit by earning interest on these reserves, while the stablecoins themselves do not pay interest to holders. Use of Stablecoins: They are primarily used for rapid payments and settlements, especially in international trade or business-to-business transactions. Monetary Expansion Effect: When banks hold Treasuries and issue an equivalent amount of stablecoins, it effectively increases the money supply (the Treasuries still exist, and now stablecoins are also in circulation). This is a positive for the stock market because it increases the liquidity of money and boosts economic efficiency. Impact on Us as Investors: The accelerated flow of money will stimulate the economy, which is good for the stock market. Banks gain a new source of interest income from issuing stablecoins, so bank stocks may benefit. Regulation and KYC: To prevent money laundering, etc., the issuance and trading of stablecoins will be strictly regulated, requiring KYC (Know Your Customer) identity verification. Lily # Question: She would like to know about Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s typical day and his favorite news, magazines, or TV shows, in order to better learn his investment philosophy and life principles. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Recommended YouTube Channels: \u0026ldquo;宏观洞察\u0026rdquo; (Macro-Insight, for mainstream US political and economic views), \u0026ldquo;爱丽的无废话财经\u0026rdquo; (Alice\u0026rsquo;s No-Nonsense Finance, for relatively objective analysis of China\u0026rsquo;s situation), \u0026ldquo;Mr. Edwin财经\u0026rdquo; (Mr. Edwin Finance). He absorbs information, thinks, researches, and connects the dots to form his own knowledge. Daily Life: Responds to comments and emails, makes short videos, has lunch and a nap, makes fruit and vegetable smoothies, snacks, has dinner, listens to audiobooks at night (prepares for bed at 9 PM), grows tomatoes, cucumbers, and flowers, and walks and dines with his family. His life is plain and simple. Clarification: Denies being a \u0026ldquo;Trump fan\u0026rdquo; and does not comment on quarrels between political figures. Personal Background: Shared a link to a previous interview (\u0026ldquo;美香\u0026rdquo;) and the YouTube playlist \u0026ldquo;缘起今日\u0026rdquo; (Origins of Today), which contain more about his personal experiences. SiFei # Question: Does the teacher use Zi Wei Dou Shu (Purple Star Astrology), metaphysics, or similar methods to look at stocks or investment directions? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: In theory, Zi Wei Dou Shu could be used for stocks, and some friends use the I Ching for divination, but he has never actually used them for investment decisions, only for understanding his personal birth chart. He emphasizes that there\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with these tools themselves, but if the user is not proficient or has ill intentions (like fortune-tellers who often exaggerate problems to sell solutions), they can be misleading or even harmful. One should not blindly trust them unless one has studied them deeply and knows how to apply them correctly. He has, however, practiced technical analysis in the past. Summary of Other Message Board Questions (Quickly answered by Teacher James) # 00670L (Yuanta S\u0026amp;P 500 Futures ETF - USD Hedged): It is currency-hedged. Holding both 00662 (Yuanta S\u0026amp;P 500 ETF, unhedged) and 00670L can hedge against exchange rate risk. Taiwan Real Estate: The rental yield is low; he suggests selling it to invest in QQQ. TQQQ (3x Leveraged QQQ ETF): Too volatile, not suitable for those seeking stability. Origin of Financial Products: Many will eventually integrate with Wall Street; it\u0026rsquo;s hard to succeed without entering Wall Street. Bitcoin: Not recommended for ordinary investors. Stablecoins will be more widely used in the future. Alipay: It\u0026rsquo;s backed by the Renminbi or credit cards, a different mechanism from digital stablecoins. Judging the Veracity of Information (Rosemary\u0026rsquo;s view): If you listen to someone talk for a long time and still don\u0026rsquo;t understand what they\u0026rsquo;re saying, it\u0026rsquo;s likely they don\u0026rsquo;t understand it themselves. Someone who truly understands can explain complex things clearly. Binance\u0026rsquo;s Profitability: Earns in the tens of billions of US dollars per year, which is why banks are eager to enter the stablecoin market. Gold: It\u0026rsquo;s impossible for it to outperform the S\u0026amp;P 500; its main function is to hedge against inflation. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Past Individual Stock Picking: He once achieved annualized returns of 19%-24%, but now chooses index investing (QQQ\u0026rsquo;s annualized return is 14%; his return is lower than the index itself because Beta\u0026lt;1, but his ROE is still high due to borrowing), placing a higher value on inner peace. Attitude Towards Life: \u0026ldquo;Whatever, it\u0026rsquo;s all good, no problem.\u0026rdquo; He doesn\u0026rsquo;t argue with people, isn\u0026rsquo;t affected by emotions, and focuses on his own affairs. IV. Key Quotes # The market is about to hit a new high very soon, this is probably something that we investors\u0026hellip; we really don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry so much. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis viewpoint emphasizes confidence in the long-term market trend, encouraging investors to ignore short-term fluctuations.\nIn investing, besides wealth, we should also pursue inner peace. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis points to a higher goal of investing: peace of mind.\nWhy do I use index funds?

We haven\u0026rsquo;t lost a single one, and they keep laying eggs. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis vividly illustrates the essence of leveraged investing: skillfully using low-cost capital (other people\u0026rsquo;s chickens) to create more wealth for oneself (one\u0026rsquo;s own chickens laying eggs).\nThe prescription I give to everyone is unique; it\u0026rsquo;s different for each person\u0026hellip; With a Beta above 0.5, you will become wealthy. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis emphasizes the importance of personalized asset allocation and provides a basic threshold for becoming wealthy.\nOnce stablecoins are in play, the US dollar\u0026rsquo;s hegemony will gain the upper hand yet again. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis analyzes how the US, by regulating and absorbing stablecoins, could further consolidate the hegemony of the US dollar.\nIf you listen to something, and after the person has finished speaking, you don\u0026rsquo;t understand what they\u0026rsquo;re talking about, it\u0026rsquo;s probably because they don\u0026rsquo;t understand it, not because you don\u0026rsquo;t. \u0026ndash; Teacher James (quoting and agreeing with Rosemary\u0026rsquo;s viewpoint)\nThis offers a method for judging whether an information provider truly understands the content they are presenting.\nLooking back on life, there is neither wind, nor rain, nor clear skies\u0026hellip; Whatever, it\u0026rsquo;s all good, no problem. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis expresses a transcendent attitude towards life, which is also applicable to facing the uncertainties of the investment market.\nV. Summary # In this session, Teacher James once again emphasized the core strategy of long-term investment in high-quality index funds (like QQQ) and encouraged investors to remain optimistic in the current market environment. He focused on the personalized needs of asset allocation, particularly providing several robust allocation plans for retirees, aimed at balancing returns and risks to ultimately achieve financial freedom and inner peace. Furthermore, from the height of life philosophy, the teacher elaborated on the importance of an investor\u0026rsquo;s mindset, reminding investors to overcome the weaknesses of human nature. In the Q\u0026amp;A session, he provided detailed answers to hot-topic questions from students regarding Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s credit lines, how to explain investing to young people, the use of leverage, the mechanism of stablecoins, and their profound impact on the future financial landscape (especially the status of the US dollar and the stock market). Overall, this session offered a comprehensive guide for investors, encompassing macroeconomic outlooks, micro-level operational advice, and deep philosophical insights.\nDisclaimer: This article is for personal study notes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Theme of This Session # Mr. James\u0026rsquo;s core viewpoints in this session revolve around long-term investing, ignoring market noise, understanding the essence of capitalism, and balancing wealth with life. He emphasizes that investors should focus on quality passive ETFs like the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQQ) and possess the patience and optimism for long-term holding. Simultaneously, he deeply analyzes the impact of the capitalist system on different social classes, how to utilize capital markets to achieve personal and family financial freedom, and explores profound topics such as the relationship between wealth accumulation and life happiness, family relationships, children\u0026rsquo;s education, elderly care for parents, and wealth inheritance.\nII. Briefing Content # Market Volatility and Investment Mentality # No need to pay attention to market signals: Market disturbances (like tariffs, wars) are irrelevant to long-term investing; the market will eventually rise, and approaching or even setting new highs is normal. Investors need not worry about short-term signals. Example: The current market is full of turmoil, yet it\u0026rsquo;s close to setting new highs, proving that short-term signals are inconsequential. Learn from history, understand the present: The century-long history of the U.S. stock market shows that while it doesn\u0026rsquo;t repeat, it rhymes astonishingly. Understanding history helps solidify long-term investment beliefs. Mr. James shares insights based on his 40 years of market experience and understanding of 200 years of U.S. market history. Optimism and patience: Investors should always be extremely optimistic and unaffected by external pessimism and fear-mongering. \u0026ldquo;If you don\u0026rsquo;t listen or look, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist.\u0026rdquo; Wealth is worth waiting for; investing requires patience. Technical analysis is ineffective: Those who believe technical analysis is effective haven\u0026rsquo;t truly grasped investing. Market fluctuations can sometimes be like \u0026ldquo;madness\u0026rdquo;; no need to dance to its tune. Core Investment Strategies and Tools # Focus on the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQQ): This is currently the fastest-growing passive ETF globally, suitable for young investors to accelerate asset appreciation. Mr. James provides links to resources for investing in Nasdaq 100 Index Funds worldwide. Learning resources: Recommends watching a series of videos (e.g., 00451 \u0026ldquo;Value Investing Lecture\u0026rdquo; as a compulsory course for newcomers, as well as 398, 399, 400, etc.), learning them in conjunction with the market conditions at the time to achieve a solid grasp. Getting started for young professionals/small investors: It\u0026rsquo;s advised to set aside an emergency fund for six months to a year before starting to invest in QQQ or 00662 (a Taiwanese ETF tracking Nasdaq 100). Buy whenever you have money, don\u0026rsquo;t try to time the market, buy at market price. The Nature of Capitalism and How to Cope # Systemic traps of capitalism: Mr. James quotes and agrees with a YouTuber\u0026rsquo;s perspective that capitalism is designed to favor the rich, reflected in: Tax mechanisms: Investment income (e.g., U.S. Long-term Capital Gains, tax-free for singles up to $40k/couples up to $80k, with rates of 15%-20% above that) is taxed at much lower rates than labor income (up to 37%), benefiting long-term investors. Taiwan doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have capital gains tax. Triple risks for the middle class: Job, company stock, and property near the company are highly intertwined. If the company has problems, one might lose their job, stock value, and property (or face mortgage pressure) simultaneously. Advice: Sell company stock promptly and reinvest in QQQ; buy a house only after achieving financial freedom (\u0026ldquo;buying a house should be like buying slippers\u0026rdquo;). Differences in borrowing: The rich borrow money to get richer (investment), while the middle class borrows money to become poorer (consumption). Differences in income growth: Income from physical labor struggles to keep pace with inflation and asset appreciation. Differences in offspring development: Middle-class children rely on \u0026ldquo;involution\u0026rdquo; (cram schools, prestigious universities, spending hundreds of thousands to get into private schools), while wealthy children can pursue their interests and grow up happily. Impact of financial bubbles: The middle class is forced to sell assets at low prices when bubbles burst because they can\u0026rsquo;t hold on, while the rich have the money and opportunity to buy the dip. Utilizing capitalism: Despite its pitfalls, the capital market is an important way for ordinary people to bridge the wealth gap and share the dividends of social progress. At the national level: If citizens all become capitalists, holding shares in globally competitive companies (like TSMC, Apple), they can enjoy the benefits of globalization while \u0026ldquo;transferring\u0026rdquo; negative externalities of production (like pollution). Citizens should ponder: Is it better to be proud of owning a factory, or proud of owning shares in that factory? The \u0026ldquo;Borrow 100 Million\u0026rdquo; thought experiment: If someone were willing to lend you 100 million (any currency) at 5% interest, to be repaid in 40 years, would you dare to borrow it? Those who dare and know how to use it possess a rich mindset, because this money, through investment, can generate returns far exceeding the interest, potentially allowing for immediate retirement. The key is whether you have the credit or assets to borrow this sum. Inspiration from Trump\u0026rsquo;s proposed \u0026ldquo;Great Child America Act\u0026rdquo;: Investing $1,000 annually for newborns from a young age cultivates financial literacy and long-term compound interest awareness, reflecting a nation\u0026rsquo;s soft power. This is more meaningful than direct subsidies. Life, Family, and Wealth Philosophy # Beyond \u0026ldquo;cost\u0026rdquo; thinking: Falling in love, getting married, and having children should not be calculated as \u0026ldquo;costs.\u0026rdquo; With a long-term wealth perspective (e.g., 1 million becoming 1 billion in 40 years), money is meant to be spent, and family is for sharing love. Example: If you only think about the immediate 1 million not being enough, you miss the possibility of becoming a billionaire enjoying life in the future. By 60-70, even with money, you might not be able to make up for regrets from youth (like having children). The \u0026ldquo;Die with Zero\u0026rdquo; philosophy: Life should be fully experienced, rather than dying with a huge fortune, which is the tragedy of \u0026ldquo;having nothing but money.\u0026rdquo; Money should be spent wisely to create beautiful memories. Financial wisdom for couples: Economic security: The higher-earning spouse should proactively transfer a portion of their funds (e.g., 50k from a 150k salary) to the other\u0026rsquo;s account, giving them financial freedom and security, avoiding the need to \u0026ldquo;report everything\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;ask for money.\u0026rdquo; Common goals: Couples should have aligned financial views, invest together, and not bicker over money (like who does the dishes or takes out the trash). A home needs love. Improve oneself first: In a family, first make yourself \u0026ldquo;worthy of being loved.\u0026rdquo; Becoming the \u0026ldquo;big tree\u0026rdquo; of the family: Through long-term investment, everyone has the potential (hundreds of thousands becoming hundreds of millions, millions becoming billions) to become the family\u0026rsquo;s economic pillar, providing shelter for loved ones. Elderly care for parents: Health is the biggest money-saver: Instead of worrying if pensions are sufficient, care more about parents\u0026rsquo; health, manage their blood pressure and blood sugar, ensure they take medication on time, and have regular check-ups (e.g., for macular degeneration, joints, carotid artery stents). Healthy parents mean a lighter burden for children. Cost estimation: If parents are completely dependent, a caregiver plus basic expenses might cost NT$80,000-100,000 per month. Mr. James\u0026rsquo;s mother cost about NT$10 million over 10 years. Plan early: When children are 30, parents are around 60. Significant expenses might arise after age 80. Regularly investing NT$1,000-2,000 per month for parents can accumulate a considerable pension fund after 20 years. Investment Practice and Risk Management # Simplify investing: Once asset allocation is done, you can set it to \u0026ldquo;autopilot,\u0026rdquo; no need to watch the market daily or analyze asset performance. Spending 5 minutes once a year for rebalancing is sufficient. Risk awareness: \u0026ldquo;Market goes to zero\u0026rdquo; test: Before any investment decision, ask yourself, \u0026ldquo;If this investment goes to zero tomorrow, can I handle it? Even if I can\u0026rsquo;t sell stocks for three years, can I survive?\u0026rdquo; If not, the risk is too high. Liquidity risk: Some markets or specific situations (like some mainland China ETFs in 2022) may experience situations where you want to sell but cannot. Leverage risk: Margin loans (e.g., from a brokerage account) are extremely risky. A market downturn can lead to margin calls or even negative equity (e.g., stocks drop to $800k, but you borrowed $1 million, owing $200k). Personal loans (with stable income, used for investment) are relatively manageable because they are not directly tied to stock market value for forced liquidation. The essence of learning: It\u0026rsquo;s not just about learning what works, but more importantly, learning that \u0026ldquo;these things are useless\u0026rdquo; (like technical analysis, economic analysis, business cycle indicators). This conclusion is reached after understanding these tools. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # CADRE # Sharing: Observed some people nearing retirement with no stable income wanting to borrow money to invest. However, their understanding of investment philosophy and risk tolerance might be insufficient. Advised such individuals not to borrow easily; they should first build a solid foundation with their own funds and become mentally strong enough before considering advanced operations. Mr. James\u0026rsquo;s comments: Strongly agree. Investors first need to experience market volatility (e.g., a 10-15% correction) with their own funds to confirm they can tolerate it before considering borrowing. For retirees: Personal loans: If there\u0026rsquo;s no stable income for repayment, a market downturn will force selling stocks to repay debt, which is not recommended. Mortgages: A home equity line of credit (HELOC, interest-only payments, like in the US) might be considered; however, mortgages requiring principal and interest payments are not recommended due to the large amounts involved. Core principle: For any leveraged investment, consider, \u0026ldquo;If the stock drops to zero, the loan still needs to be repaid. Can I handle it?\u0026rdquo; Sams # Sharing 1: As a listener for over two years, he gradually shifted personal funds, private equity, trusts, and insurance products into QQQ and domestic Nasdaq ETFs. Due to excessive optimism, he used margin (brokerage account overdraft to buy) from late 2023 to early 2024, almost at 1:1 leverage. He then encountered the \u0026ldquo;tariff war\u0026rdquo; and liquidity issues in the domestic ETF market (e.g., 513100), where some ETFs hit their limit down and couldn\u0026rsquo;t be sold. He was forced to significantly deleverage the next day, wiping out much of the previous year\u0026rsquo;s profits. His father\u0026rsquo;s account, with no leverage and regular investments, hit an all-time high. Profound realization: Don\u0026rsquo;t rush to make money; slow is fast, and safety is more important. Personal cash flow and future income expectations are crucial when using leverage. Also, in panic, he cleared out QLD from his Hong Kong account, missing the subsequent rally. This experience reminded him of the 2015 A-share market crash, also involving margin calls and being unable to sell for three consecutive days. Mr. James\u0026rsquo;s comments: Sams\u0026rsquo; experience is very typical. Markets have liquidity risks, and margin risks are enormous, potentially leading to margin calls or even owing the brokerage money. Repeatedly emphasized the importance of the \u0026ldquo;market goes to zero test.\u0026rdquo; Don\u0026rsquo;t test human nature. Sharing 2: Investing allows one to control their own destiny. He experienced his company being acquired, then another company he co-founded being acquired (sold to Evergrande, which later defaulted, and got entangled in lawsuits), and personally shutting down an underperforming branch (decided to close the Chongqing branch after a three-hour walk with his boss; employees were given N+1 severance the next day). Because he had investments as a backup, he was more composed when facing these changes. Colleagues without investments (like some branch managers) felt lost about their future. Insight: Whether in good times or bad, hold on to good assets. Mr. James\u0026rsquo;s comments: All things have unexpected events (companies go bankrupt, properties get damaged). When investing, first think about risk. Jobs and individual stocks carry high risks. QQQ will also drop significantly. Only invest money you won\u0026rsquo;t need for 15-20-30 years. Retirees need to set aside about 15 years of cash for living expenses. Question: Mr. James once suggested 70% QQQ / 30% cash, and allocating 2% to leveraged funds (like QLD) in down years. He wanted to confirm: Can mainland China and Hong Kong accounts be treated as one, with a synchronized 70/30 allocation? Since transferring funds out of mainland China is troublesome, should more leveraged funds be allocated in Hong Kong? If the market falls at year-end, is the 2% allocation to leveraged funds based on 2% of total assets or only 2% of Hong Kong assets? Mr. James\u0026rsquo;s reply: For beginners or those sensitive to volatility, 70/30 (QQQ/cash) or even 60/40 is a safe starting point. No need to rush into leveraged funds. Because even if the overall drop isn\u0026rsquo;t large, the violent fluctuations of leveraged funds themselves can cause anxiety (e.g., only focusing on QLD dropping 5%, not seeing that cash doesn\u0026rsquo;t drop). Beta can start at a lower level (e.g., 0.6-0.8) and gradually increase with experience and asset growth. Regarding the 2% QLD allocation: It can be calculated based on Hong Kong assets or total assets. However, note that leveraged funds usually cannot be used as collateral for bank loans (e.g., at HSBC). If QLD proportion is too high, it might affect future collateralized financing plans. DVA # Sharing: Listening to Mr. James\u0026rsquo;s class is like learning life philosophy; investing is a battle against human nature. Experienced the recent market correction (what the teacher called a \u0026ldquo;slap in the face\u0026rdquo; market). Although he wanted to hold on, he was scared and sold half of his holdings, including some individual stocks like Nvidia. Question: His Roth IRA account is small, and he\u0026rsquo;s nearing retirement. He wants to know if an allocation of 60% QQQ + 10% TQQQ + 30% cash, or 70% QQQ + 20% TQQQ + 10% cash, resulting in an overall Beta of around 0.8, is robust enough while also providing growth. Mr. James\u0026rsquo;s reply: A 60/10/30 (QQQ/TQQQ/cash) configuration, with a Beta around 0.8, is very good. Beta will increase as the leveraged portion grows. For those afraid of volatility, an initial Beta of 0.6-0.8 is sufficient. Yao # Sharing: Recently, watching news (Elon Musk leaving the White House after 130 days, under immense pressure, even relying on medication and games to de-stress) and movies (the heavy burden and helplessness of the protagonist in \u0026ldquo;Oppenheimer\u0026rdquo;), he realized \u0026ldquo;uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.\u0026rdquo; If ordinary people lack such talent and resilience, it\u0026rsquo;s better to follow the teacher\u0026rsquo;s philosophy, achieve wealth calmly and happily, without enduring those extreme pressures and risks. Investing slowly and waiting for the compounding effect is a good choice. Mr. James\u0026rsquo;s comments: Slow is fast. Don\u0026rsquo;t use money you need to earn money you don\u0026rsquo;t need. Life should be about reducing regrets, not chasing empty fame and fortune. Enjoy the fruits of enterprises (like Nvidia) through tools like QQQ, without bearing the immense pressure of the operators. Ju # Sharing: Introduced to Mr. James\u0026rsquo;s philosophy by a friend in 2018/2019. As a stock market novice, he was deeply inspired and immediately adjusted his strategy, investing borrowed funds and continuing with regular contributions. He once participated in short-term trading studies (joined a stock reading club) but found it arduous and the ROE (Return on Equity) not high. He had to watch the market daily, research US stocks, Taiwan stocks, margin changes, aiming for a 10-20% annualized return, and only dared to invest a portion of his capital (e.g., 10-30%). So he gave up, focused on his main job and long-term investing, and now lives a peaceful and prosperous life (meditating morning and evening). When sharing his philosophy with friends and colleagues, he found they hesitated to invest for their own long-term (feeling 20-30 years is too long), but were more receptive to investing for their children, which might then lead them to participate themselves. Having experienced 00662 (a Taiwanese Nasdaq 100 ETF) dropping from over 50 to the 40s and persisting in buying, he is now calm about current market fluctuations. Mr. James\u0026rsquo;s comments: Many short-term traders only look at the ROI (Return on Investment) of individual trades, ignoring the ROE (Return on Equity) on their total assets. They might achieve a high ROI with a small amount of capital, but it contributes little to overall wealth growth. For example, with 1 million in capital, using 30,000 to make 30,000 is a 100% ROI, but only a 3% ROE. Whereas we aim for a 10% return on the entire 1 million, which is 100,000. Chen Hua # Question 1: Noticed Mr. James recently emphasizing conservatism more, suggesting a 30% cash position (earlier it was 10-20%). Is this due to varying student experience levels or other considerations? He himself targets a Beta of 1.0, holds leveraged funds, has little cash, and would need to reduce leveraged funds to reach 30% cash. Mr. James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Yes, this is because students come from diverse backgrounds; many are novices or cannot withstand significant volatility. A 30% (or even 40%) cash position is a \u0026ldquo;plain beef noodle soup\u0026rdquo; style basic version, suitable for everyone to start with. Experienced investors who can tolerate risk can adjust it themselves, choosing a \u0026ldquo;mildly spicy\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;extra spicy\u0026rdquo; allocation. Asset allocation is very personal. Question 2: Regarding wealth inheritance. Warren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s testamentary portfolio (90% S\u0026amp;P 500 + 10% short-term bonds) is suitable due to his vast assets. For ordinary people whose descendants have no interest in investing, how should a \u0026ldquo;permanent\u0026rdquo; trust asset allocation plan be established? (Citing Anita Mui\u0026rsquo;s trust case) Mr. James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Firstly, children\u0026rsquo;s moral character and values education (quoting Lin Zexu: \u0026ldquo;If my descendants are like me, what\u0026rsquo;s the use of leaving them money? If my descendants are not like me, what\u0026rsquo;s the use of leaving them money?\u0026rdquo;) is more important than wealth inheritance. Wealth should be the icing on the cake. One can start considering gifting when their assets exceed 50 times their annual expenses. It\u0026rsquo;s not advisable to easily set up a private non-profit foundation unless the children are genuinely committed, otherwise, it might become a burden or a management problem. Trust selection: Trust services from large financial institutions (like HSBC, Charles Schwab) are generally more stable than private family offices (even if the institution fails, assets are protected, like Credit Suisse being taken over by UBS), but offer less flexibility. One can set up a portfolio like 70% QQQ / 30% cash (or short-term bonds/money market funds), with a rule to withdraw 2% annually, achieving perpetuity. The key is simplicity and low management fees. Private family offices might offer comprehensive services, but institutional trusts focus more on asset management and distribution. IV. Key Quotes / Insightful Points # Market fluctuations have nothing to do with me anymore.

Summary # In this CLEC sharing session, Mr. James once again emphasized the importance of long-term holding of quality assets (especially the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund) and reminded investors to ignore market noise and focus on their own investment discipline. He deeply analyzed the operational mechanisms of capitalism, pointing out that ordinary people can achieve wealth growth through capital markets and escape the \u0026ldquo;laborer mindset.\u0026rdquo; The discussion covered several important topics, including risk management (especially a cautious attitude towards using leverage, advising most to start with a conservative cash ratio, and conducting the \u0026ldquo;market goes to zero\u0026rdquo; test), the wisdom of wealth inheritance (emphasizing children\u0026rsquo;s moral education first and suggesting simple, sustainable trust solutions through financial institutions), elderly care for parents (prioritizing health management over financial worries), and balancing investment with life happiness (avoiding excessive calculation of \u0026ldquo;costs\u0026rdquo; in life, living in the present, and achieving the state of \u0026ldquo;Die with Zero\u0026rdquo;). Participants\u0026rsquo; sharing also provided valuable practical experiences and lessons, particularly regarding leverage risks, market liquidity, and the profound impact of investment on personal control over one\u0026rsquo;s destiny. Overall, this session aimed to help investors establish the correct investment mindset and methodology to achieve long-term financial health and a fulfilling life.\nDisclaimer: This article is for personal learning notes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Theme of the Session # The core of this session is to emphasize the importance of emotional control and mental fortitude in long-term investing, proposing a life attitude of \u0026ldquo;Whatever, it\u0026rsquo;s all fine, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter\u0026rdquo; to cope with market fluctuations and life\u0026rsquo;s challenges. Teacher James elaborates on asset allocation principles, especially the critical role of cash position (recommended not less than 30%) in stock pledging strategies, and critically analyzes Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s day trading policies and their impact on investors. Furthermore, the course integrates profound insights on the meaning of work, personal growth, meditation, mindfulness, and emerging financial trends (like stablecoins).\nII. Presentation Content # Recommended Learning Resources (Mentioned at the beginning) # Facebook Page \u0026ldquo;inrichment疾风胜\u0026rdquo;: Teacher James mentioned this Facebook article, which covers not only investment and financial management but also psychological preparation and mindset adjustment, offering a \u0026ldquo;mental massage\u0026rdquo; effect. \u0026ldquo;CAD贵妇理财\u0026rdquo; (CAD Wealthy Lady Financial Management): Also mentioned as a good sharer of financial management content. Prerequisites for Stock Pledging (Discussed at the beginning) # HSBC (Hong Kong) Stock Pledging Threshold: Must be an \u0026ldquo;HSBC Premier\u0026rdquo; client or above, meaning one needs to have over 1 million HKD in assets with HSBC Hong Kong; this is a VIP service. Market Volatility and Investment Mentality # The market is often swayed by news, causing volatility. Investors should understand the reasons but avoid letting emotions dictate their actions, which could lead to wrong decisions (like panic selling or greedy chasing of highs). Controlling emotions is crucial. One can adopt methods like \u0026ldquo;tying one\u0026rsquo;s hands and feet,\u0026rdquo; such as temporarily locking accounts or deleting apps to avoid impulsive operations. Example Strategy for Large Capital Investment: For 1 million in funds, 500,000 can be bought at market price immediately; another 250,000 can be bought in batches (e.g., 50,000 per month for 5 months), disregarding short-term fluctuations; the remaining 250,000 serves as cash reserves or for discretionary decisions. The ultimate goal is to have most of the capital (e.g., 75%) in the market. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy is unrelated to short-term stock market fluctuations, emphasizing the principle of buying as soon as it\u0026rsquo;s available. Investment Philosophy and Life Attitude # Risk Aversion: Life is about avoiding failure, not pursuing extreme success. The priority in investment is to \u0026ldquo;survive\u0026rdquo;; stable profits are more important than risking bankruptcy. Simplicity is also a form of success. Reduce Desires, Strengthen Inner Self: Avoid \u0026ldquo;greed, anger, and delusion\u0026rdquo;; adopt an attitude of \u0026ldquo;Whatever, it\u0026rsquo;s all fine, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter\u0026rdquo; towards material possessions and relationships. Only by not fearing loss can one truly possess. Dare to \u0026ldquo;Break the Mold\u0026rdquo; (破局): Life, like negotiation, often favors those who dare to \u0026ldquo;break\u0026rdquo; (break conventions, not afraid of falling out). Focus on Life, Downplay the Market: Correct investing is not time-consuming; one should focus on living happily and let time make money for us. Meditation and Mindfulness: Can be practiced anytime, anywhere. Focus on the present moment (e.g., breathing, conversation), without dwelling on the past or future, maintaining inner peace (a mind like still water). Analysis of Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s Day Trading Policy # The Taiwanese government encourages day trading by reducing transaction tax (securities transaction tax halved) to increase market liquidity. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Critique: No Capital Gains Tax: Superficially beneficial to long-term investors, but it actually doesn\u0026rsquo;t encourage long-term holding because short-term trading also has no capital gains tax, giving no extra advantage to long-term investors. High Transaction Costs: The \u0026ldquo;securities transaction tax\u0026rdquo; (actually a transaction fee) becomes extremely high with frequent trading. For example, a transaction cost of 0.6% (0.3% for buying and 0.3% for selling), if traded 10 times a year, would erode 6.16% of the total capital as fees, far exceeding expected returns. Misleading \u0026ldquo;Securities Income Tax\u0026rdquo; (正所税): What Taiwan calls \u0026ldquo;securities income tax\u0026rdquo; is not a true income tax (paid only when there\u0026rsquo;s income) but a transaction fee (paid upon transaction, regardless of profit or loss), a misleading term for the public. Retail Investors\u0026rsquo; Dilemma: This policy essentially causes retail investors to lose money due to high fees in frequent trading, while the government collects more transaction fees. Comparison with the US: Transaction costs are very low, but there is a capital gains tax, which to some extent encourages long-term holding. Learning and Thinking # Independent Thinking: Others can provide knowledge, but thinking must be done by oneself. A life without thinking is not very meaningful (though the teacher also reflects on this, believing different lifestyles have their own meaning). Lwin\u0026rsquo;s Sharing (Regarding lump-sum vs. installment investment): Depends on individual risk tolerance. If an investment leads to panic after a market drop, it means the position is too heavy; one should increase the cash proportion until market fluctuations can be faced calmly. IM\u0026rsquo;s Sharing (Young people\u0026rsquo;s investment and primary profession): Young people should focus on their primary profession; investment should not take up work time. Work is not just for making money, but also for serving others and realizing life\u0026rsquo;s meaning. Core Principles of Asset Allocation (Related to Stock Pledging) # Cash is King: The initial cash position should not be less than 30% (e.g., 30% cash in a 4-3-3 allocation, or 50% cash 50% QQQ). Use of Leveraged Funds: Leveraged funds should not exceed the cash position, nor should they exceed the position of core funds (like QQQ). Can be adjusted according to individual risk tolerance, e.g., 4-2-4 (40% QQQ, 20% leverage, 40% cash) or no leverage at all. Final performance depends on the market, not the precise asset allocation ratio. Other Important Tips # CLEC Resources: The YouTube channel has a \u0026ldquo;Investment Lecture Worth 100 Million\u0026rdquo; series; it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to start learning from 00451, then watch in the order of 00398, 00399, 00400. Community Principles: Focus on CLEC investment philosophy, do not discuss unrelated topics (like insurance, short-term real estate, etc.). Recommended Tickers: Mainly recommends Nasdaq 100 index funds (QQQ and its equivalents in various regions). Long-term Perspective: Investing is a matter of twenty to thirty years or more; short-term fluctuations are like passing clouds. The fundamentals of the US economy and corporations remain strong.

Investment is high risk; be responsible for your own decisions. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # CAD # Sharing: Recently traveled with friends, overcame concerns about spending, and experienced the joy of not watching the market and focusing on the present. She emphasized that once money is invested in the market, one should let go and execute the plan (e.g., dollar-cost averaging), then go enjoy life. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s comment: We will all be very wealthy in the future (adding three zeros to assets is common). Spend money wisely; you can spend when cash is ample (30% of total assets). If travel expenses would dip into core allocation cash, it\u0026rsquo;s better to sell a small amount of stock for travel, which actually reduces risk (lowers beta). Borrowing against pledged stocks for consumption is safer because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t touch the principal. For example, with 10 million in assets, if all in 00662, a major market crash could lead to bankruptcy; with 20 million in assets (10 million in 00662, 10 million in cash, and a 10 million loan), after an 80% drop, you\u0026rsquo;d still have 12 million (2 million in stocks + 10 million in cash), which is safer. CAD adds: The cash in an allocation (like the \u0026lsquo;3\u0026rsquo; in 4-3-3) is part of the portfolio and cannot be spent随意, or it will disrupt the ratio. Spending should be done through pledging loans or by withdrawing according to the 2% rule. Question (None) Overseas Loner # Sharing: Listener from Taiwan, 34 years old, with assets of 15 million TWD, has been investing in 00662 for about a year following the teacher\u0026rsquo;s method. Question 1: Current monthly income is about 50,000 TWD, annual income less than a million, not considered high in Taiwan. To retire early, should I switch to a higher-paying technical job (like a technician in the tech industry) to accelerate asset accumulation? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Work should primarily bring joy, not just money. High-paying jobs might sacrifice health and family. 15 million TWD is already very wealthy and will grow rapidly. If changing jobs, the primary goals should be health, happiness, and joy, not purely chasing money. Question 2: Tried leveraged funds (like TQQQ) but found their violent fluctuations psychologically unbearable, then switched to 100% unleveraged funds (00662). The teacher previously backtested that a 4-3-3 allocation could survive the 2000 dot-com bubble (80% drop). Is it because of such extreme market conditions that the 4-3-3 allocation appears superior? If future market volatility is smaller, might other allocations (like 100% 00662) be better? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: The 4-3-3 is designed to seek maximum returns at the edge of risk (e.g., maintenance margin of 167%) and can barely survive extreme conditions. If backtested with the 2000 market, a 50% cash / 50% QQQ (with smart rebalancing into leverage during downturns) might perform comparably or even better than 4-3-3 because more cash means more safety. However, in a long-term bull market, 4-3-3 would outperform 50/50. Since the future market is unknown, it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to determine which allocation is definitively optimal. The core principles are: cash not less than 30%, leveraged funds not exceeding cash, and not exceeding unleveraged funds. Leveraged funds can be zero (e.g., 70% QQQ, 30% cash). Watson # Sharing: Emphasizes the importance of learning CLEC investment philosophy, especially before stock pledging. This year, practically implemented the teacher\u0026rsquo;s advice by canceling long-held savings insurance policies, deeply realizing that insurance, real estate, and long-term bonds are not quality assets. Wrong decisions must be corrected immediately; correct ones should be persisted. Wealth growth is just a matter of time. Question 1: When calculating total assets to withdraw the annual 2% for living expenses, should funds borrowed via credit and invested in the market also be included in total assets? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Yes, they should be included. The principal and interest payments for the credit are part of living expenses, and it\u0026rsquo;s reasonable to use the 2% withdrawal to cover living expenses and loan payments. Question 2: If the market falls continuously for 10 years, and one still withdraws 2% for living expenses annually and performs \u0026ldquo;smart rebalancing\u0026rdquo; (investing the 2% cash into the market), would this deal a devastating blow to the asset allocation? Should the withdrawal percentage be reduced or rebalancing paused? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Real history (e.g., 2000-2009) was not a continuous 10-year decline but had ups and downs. It fell from 2000-2003, investing about 6%; rose from 2003-2007, cash flowed out; fell in 2008, investing 2%. In total, about 4 years of investment (8%). If an extreme 10-year continuous decline truly occurred, the cash in a 4-3-3 allocation might indeed be insufficient. If \u0026ldquo;smart rebalancing\u0026rdquo; is not done, there would be more cash when the market rebounds. Question 3: The 2% annual withdrawal benchmark: is it calculated based on total assets at the end of the previous year (e.g., December 31st), or on the initial total assets invested? Or adjust after assets have doubled? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to initially withdraw 2% of the initial total assets. After assets have significantly appreciated (e.g., doubled or severalfold), if one wishes to increase living expenses, a complete asset allocation replanning is needed (similar to the \u0026ldquo;Scenario 19\u0026rdquo; principle: first reserve enough cash to cover debts and decades of future living expenses, then allocate the remainder according to 4-3-3 or similar ratios). Question 4: Hong Kong HIBOR is very low recently (about 0.6%), total borrowing cost is about 1.5%. Can I borrow more than 20% (the teacher\u0026rsquo;s recommended pledging loan limit) from HSBC stock pledge loans to buy SGOV or BOXX (currently yielding about 4.3%) for arbitrage? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Yes. This arbitrage fund is an independent operation and does not change the allocation ratio of the original pledged portfolio. The borrowed money can only buy cash equivalents like SGOV or BOXX. The main risk is exchange rate (HKD appreciating significantly against USD, though constrained by the linked exchange rate system). HSBC does not accept leveraged funds as collateral. Question 5: What are the risks of products like BOXX? HSBC does not accept BOXX as collateral. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: If HSBC doesn\u0026rsquo;t accept BOXX, use SGOV (if accepted). The main risk of BOXX and SGOV is liquidity risk in extreme market conditions (difficulty selling), which all assets (including stocks) share. Rui # Question 1: Regarding understanding the 2% withdrawal rule in extreme cases. If a person has 100 million in assets and spends 2 million annually. If the market drops 50% to 50 million, can they still spend 2 million? Or, if someone starts retirement with 50 million when the market has already fallen from a high (100 million), can they live by the 2 million standard corresponding to the original 100 million asset base? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Yes. Having 50 million at the market bottom (e.g., March 2009) might have the purchasing power or sustainability equivalent to 100 million at the market top (e.g., 2000). So, someone retiring at a market low might achieve the same living standard with less principal. Question 2: Regarding career development. At 34, feeling financially free, somewhat迷茫 about work. Promotion means more responsibility but also potentially broader horizons. How did Teacher James view promotions (e.g., to VP) after achieving financial freedom? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Promotion should be decided by oneself, not the company. When you feel you have the capability for a higher position, even better than the current incumbent, opportunities will naturally come. One should not accept a promotion when unprepared, as it could lead to failure. Continuously learn and improve in the current role to reach the capability for the next level. If capability is there, promotion is good, allowing one to serve more people. One should be overqualified for the position before promotion. Brian # Sharing: London prices are very high; one fish and chips costs 33 pounds. Question: If the US government devalues its currency, can stock pledging somewhat hedge this risk? Because assets are bought at a fixed price, while the value of debt decreases with currency devaluation. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Yes. When we borrow to invest, in a sense, we are also \u0026ldquo;printing money,\u0026rdquo; similar to government actions. We are borrowing future \u0026ldquo;trash\u0026rdquo; (potentially devalued currency) in exchange for current quality assets. If the USD devalues, the real value of our USD debt also decreases. This is a \u0026ldquo;borrow trash for assets\u0026rdquo; strategy. Sharing 2: Early investments were more aggressive (e.g., 60% QQQ, 20% TQQQ, 20% cash). Now, no longer adding new investments but focusing on increasing cash reserves, letting the existing portfolio grow naturally. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: This is very good. Even if the initial cash ratio is high (e.g., 30%), leading to a lower overall Beta, as core assets appreciate significantly, the cash proportion will relatively shrink, and the overall portfolio\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;risk\u0026rdquo; (or growth potential) remains considerable. Cash provides a huge safety net and psychological comfort. A low Beta initially is fine; eventually, the ship (assets) becomes an aircraft carrier, and the lifeboat (cash) seems insignificant. Sharing 3: Read \u0026ldquo;Why Do So Many Incompetent Men Become Leaders?\u0026rdquo;, which mentions that incompetent people often manage to appear extremely confident in front of others. Engineers are typically rigorous and find it hard to make absolute guarantees, while some ignorant yet fearless managers charge ahead. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: This is a personality issue. He himself is an \u0026ldquo;anomaly,\u0026rdquo; having done many different types of work. Just be yourself. D # Question 1: \u0026ldquo;Do you become capable first and then start, or start first and then become capable?\u0026rdquo; Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: In terms of personal learning and cultivation (practicing skills), it\u0026rsquo;s definitely \u0026ldquo;start first, then become capable.\u0026rdquo; For example, learning to invest, you have to open an account first; you can\u0026rsquo;t wait until you\u0026rsquo;ve read all the books. But in the professional world (the \u0026ldquo;martial arts world\u0026rdquo;), you can\u0026rsquo;t get promoted first and then train; that will lead to failure. Question 2: Following the teacher\u0026rsquo;s advice, invested credit borrowed in Taiwan into the market (allocated proportionally to 00662, etc.). The rationale is: future inflation will decrease cash purchasing power, so it\u0026rsquo;s better to borrow and invest now, repaying with devalued money in the future. Is this logic correct? (Friends don\u0026rsquo;t understand.) Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: The logic is perfectly correct. We are \u0026ldquo;aliens,\u0026rdquo; they are \u0026ldquo;earthlings\u0026rdquo;; different ways of thinking. Yao # Question 1: Regarding autonomous driving technology routes: Tesla (pure vision) vs. Waymo (LiDAR) competition outlook? Waymo\u0026rsquo;s development is steady but expansion is slow; Tesla\u0026rsquo;s FSD V12 is about to be released. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: He personally uses Tesla FSD and has a good experience. Waymo\u0026rsquo;s expansion is too slow; if Tesla\u0026rsquo;s performance is comparable, its production and deployment scale will far exceed Waymo\u0026rsquo;s, and costs will be lower. Waymo\u0026rsquo;s outlook is not optimistic; it\u0026rsquo;s like rifles against tanks and cannons. Question 2: Corporate innovation and leadership: It seems companies where founders are still present (like Tesla, Nvidia, Meta) are more innovative, while companies led by professional managers (like Microsoft, Google) mostly adopt follow-or-acquire strategies. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Not necessarily. Microsoft under Nadella (not a founder) has performed excellently. Starbucks improved after its founder returned. The key is corporate governance and CEO capability, but the fate of large companies is complex; sometimes \u0026ldquo;even gods can\u0026rsquo;t save them.\u0026rdquo; IBM revived; Kodak and BlackBerry declined. Intel\u0026rsquo;s future is also uncertain. Yao adds: Google\u0026rsquo;s AI is strong, but it seems to be lagging in the AI race, and its search engine is threatened by OpenAI, etc. Apple\u0026rsquo;s Vision Pro is expensive with low sales; a professional manager (Cook) might be less willing to take risks than a founder (Jobs). Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Google\u0026rsquo;s problem is its adherence to the search engine model, failing to revolutionize its integration of AI technology. This is similar to Kodak. He hasn\u0026rsquo;t used Google search for a long time, switching to OpenAI. OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s search experience far surpasses Google\u0026rsquo;s. As for various AI models, each has its pros and cons, like different tools; the key is to use them in the right place, not just compare who is \u0026ldquo;better.\u0026rdquo; Companies need the courage to abandon existing models and surpass themselves; otherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;occupying a position without fulfilling its duties\u0026rdquo; (尸位素餐), which is the beginning of demise. Maochang (王茂昌) # Question: Currently using a 4-3-3 allocation, receiving 2% for living expenses monthly through pledging. Will receive a salary of 20,000 TWD mid-month. Can I spend the pledged money first, and then invest the salary into the market when it arrives mid-month? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Yes. This 20,000 TWD salary can be invested proportionally (e.g., 60% 00662, 30% 00670L, 10% 00865B, or other suitable ratios). If you want to increase the living expense withdrawal amount in the future, a complete asset allocation replanning is needed. Candy # Sharing (Detailed personal investment journey): Inspired by \u0026ldquo;Rich Dad Poor Dad\u0026rdquo; in early years, started investing and exploring on her own. Panic sold during the market crash at the beginning of the 2020 pandemic (sold TPTQQQ around $30+), suffered losses, missed the V-shaped recovery, deeply regretted it, and paid 50% tax. During the 2022 market downturn, thanks to previous lessons and the teacher\u0026rsquo;s philosophy, plus holding 25-30% cash, her emotions were stable, and she held on. Her husband also reminded her not to sell stocks out of fear. After the market stabilized in 2023, once considered liquidating everything to invest in CDs, but after rational analysis (not worried about money, economy recovering, holding good assets), chose to continue holding quality assets. During the April 2024 market pullback, remained calm, believing in economic fundamentals (employment, CPI, GDP, stable oil prices), and eventually welcomed the May rally. Expresses gratitude for the teacher\u0026rsquo;s guidance and the luck of fellow students to directly access a mature investment system. Sharing (Life insights): Financially free for many years (about 10 years), experienced travel, hobbies, etc., but now feels a bit lost about the second half of life, lacking clear goals. Young people having goals to strive for is a blessing. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Life doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need grand meaning; \u0026ldquo;Whatever, it\u0026rsquo;s all fine, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter\u0026rdquo; is an important mindset. Find things that make you happy, like philosophical contemplation, observing the world (finance, politics, art, social phenomena, from minor car accidents to major wealth inequality). The entire world is a field for contemplation. Candy adds sharing: Once managed a poorly run orchard for nearly ten years. The time spent alone in the orchard brought her inner peace. Through dialogue with nature and deep thinking, she found answers to many significant life and investment questions, and these decisions later proved correct. Emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and \u0026ldquo;looking inward\u0026rdquo; in tranquility. Believes that in a state of extreme calmness and emptiness, answers will naturally emerge, as if connecting with a higher power. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Deeply resonates. He often talks to his garden and tomatoes, sensing their life force. The meaning of a tomato plant is to grow. A thousand-year-old sacred tree silently observes the changes of the world, indifferent to \u0026ldquo;meaning.\u0026rdquo; The things we cling to are insignificant on a cosmic scale; \u0026ldquo;there is no greatest.\u0026rdquo; Towards people and matters, including family relationships (with children, husband), maintain an attitude of \u0026ldquo;Whatever, it\u0026rsquo;s all fine, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter.\u0026rdquo; Love yourself, love others, but don\u0026rsquo;t demand a response. Question: About Bitcoin. Knows it\u0026rsquo;s digital gold, but missed it early on; now the price is high, volatility is large, and she\u0026rsquo;s unfamiliar with it. Can she allocate a small amount to Bitcoin ETFs (like 1-2%)? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Does not proactively recommend it. If one personally decides to allocate 1-2%, they bear the risk; it\u0026rsquo;s fine even if it goes to zero. However, the overall trend of digital currencies and stablecoins is beneficial for tech indices like QQQ. The US government is gradually regulating and co-opting the stablecoin market (e.g., Circle legalized, Binance paying a huge fine to become compliant), aiming to control the dominance of digital currencies. One reason Facebook\u0026rsquo;s Libra project failed was its peg to a basket of currencies, not just the USD, which was not in US interests. Tech companies can develop, but if they violate US interests, it\u0026rsquo;s illegal. Dirk # Question: News says a large amount of US Treasury bonds will mature in July. Will this have a drastic impact on US dollar short-term bond ETFs held by Taiwanese investors (like 00865B) or the New Taiwan Dollar exchange rate? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Exchange rate fluctuations are \u0026ldquo;Whatever, it\u0026rsquo;s all fine, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter.\u0026rdquo; Behind this is a global currency war and financial revolution (digital currencies, stablecoins). The US plays a key role, strengthening the dollar\u0026rsquo;s position through measures like the stablecoin bill (a student mentioned Graham-Cassidy, the teacher didn\u0026rsquo;t correct but emphasized it\u0026rsquo;s a stablecoin bill), making US Treasuries more attractive. This is positive for the overall financial system; the dollar will remain strong. No need to worry excessively about 00865B. After this bill passes, US banks other than the central bank will also be able to print money (issue stablecoins), US Treasuries will be hotter, and interest rates will fall. Other Scattered Points Mentioned by Students or Responded to by Teacher James: # HSBC Premier Stock Pledging: Requires Premier level (over 1 million HKD in assets). (Early discussion) Young Investor Allocation: 4-3-3 or 70/30 are both fine; cash not less than 30%. 4-4-2 (40% QQQ, 40% TQQQ, 20% cash) is very volatile, not suitable for everyone. HSBC Hong Kong Pledge Maintenance Margin: Relatively high, so 50% stocks / 50% cash might be a safer initial allocation (cash part can also consider SGOV/BOXX). Leveraged funds cannot be pledged at HSBC. IBIT/FBTC: Both are Bitcoin spot ETFs. IBIT (BlackRock) currently has larger trading volume; FBTC (Fidelity) is also an option. Stablecoin Bill (e.g., Genius Act / Graham-Cassidy related content on stablecoins): Expected to pass in the next month or two, will allow regulated US financial institutions to issue stablecoins, greatly invigorating the US Treasury market and dollar liquidity. This is a major positive for financial markets, an \u0026ldquo;atomic bomb-level financial explosion.\u0026rdquo; Definition of Money: JP Morgan was once asked about the money supply and retorted by asking for a definition of money first. Airline miles also count as a form of currency. Everyone writing an IOU is also printing money, as long as it circulates. IV. Highlighted Quotes # The market is often quite volatile due to news. But everyone should ignore it\u0026hellip; Don\u0026rsquo;t let it affect your investment emotions, this is very important. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nContext: Reminding students in an era of information overload to discern information and, more importantly, control emotions arising from short-term market fluctuations to avoid wrong investment decisions.\nOne\u0026rsquo;s life is not about pursuing how successful you want to be, but about avoiding failure. So, don\u0026rsquo;t do risky things, don\u0026rsquo;t take adventures. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nContext: Explaining the core principle of investment and life, emphasizing that risk control and steady sustainability are more important than pursuing exorbitant profits.\nWhatever, it\u0026rsquo;s all fine, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter\u0026hellip; If you lower your needs, lower your desires, you become stronger. Being indifferent and unafraid of loss means you succeed; this is true wealth – not fearing loss, possessing the most. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nContext: Sharing a philosophy of life and a method for inner cultivation, achieving inner strength and true abundance by reducing attachment to external things.\nCorrect investing doesn\u0026rsquo;t take time\u0026hellip; If you can forget the market\u0026rsquo;s existence and let time make money for us, that\u0026rsquo;s the most powerful. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nContext: Emphasizing the passive and simple nature of long-term investing; investors should focus on life, not constantly watch the market.\nTaiwan\u0026rsquo;s lack of capital gains tax is encouraging, well, it means not giving long-term investors benefits, i.e., not encouraging long-term investors. \u0026hellip;Moreover, this securities income tax and transaction fee are terrifying\u0026hellip; Only retail investors will lose until they go bankrupt, still thinking they will win. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nContext: Criticizing Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s stock market tax policy, arguing that while it\u0026rsquo;s named as a burden reduction, it actually harms retail investors through high-frequency trading fees and is not conducive to cultivating a long-term investment culture.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s good for young people to learn investing, but remember to take care of your main profession. Your main profession is not just about making money; work is also about serving others, it\u0026rsquo;s the meaning of life. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nContext: Responding to a young student\u0026rsquo;s question about balancing career choice and investment, emphasizing the importance of one\u0026rsquo;s primary job and its social value.\nBorrowing against pledged stocks for consumption, without spending cash, is safer. \u0026hellip;If you get a margin call on your loan, that other person with 10 million (all in stock) would also be wiped out, they\u0026rsquo;d have no money either. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nContext: Explaining why, even with cash on hand, borrowing against pledged stocks for consumption is sometimes a superior choice, as it maintains the integrity and growth potential of core assets, and comparing the safety of pure assets versus leveraged assets (with corresponding cash).\nLife can have no meaning, why must life have meaning? It doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily have to have meaning, so not having meaning is the greatest goal. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nContext: Responding to a student\u0026rsquo;s confusion about the meaning of life, proposing a transcendent view that one need not force a grand meaning onto life; living spontaneously and finding present joy is sufficient.\nWe are printing money just like the US government\u0026hellip; Aren\u0026rsquo;t we issuing our stablecoins using our assets when we borrow money? \u0026hellip;This is the highest level of capitalism – aggression. Of course, it sounds harsh, but it\u0026rsquo;s plundering. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nContext: Responding to a student\u0026rsquo;s discussion on currency devaluation and pledged borrowing, pointing out that in an environment of inflation and potential currency devaluation, borrowing to buy quality assets is a wealth strategy similar to how the current financial system operates.\nThis (stablecoin bill) is a very important thing. The most important thing this year. Things like Trump\u0026rsquo;s tariff wars are minor issues\u0026hellip; If this passes, I tell you, US Treasury interest rates will fall, and the US dollar will rise. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nContext: Discussing the stablecoin bill being promoted in the US, believing it will be a crucial move for the US to consolidate its financial hegemony and invigorate financial markets, with an impact far exceeding other short-term economic events.\nV. Summary # In this CLEC investment and financial management course, Teacher James once again emphasized his consistent long-term investment philosophy and emotional management techniques, encouraging students to face market ups and downs and life\u0026rsquo;s vicissitudes with a transcendent attitude of \u0026ldquo;Whatever, it\u0026rsquo;s all fine, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter.\u0026rdquo; The course focused on discussing the strategic importance of the cash position (not less than 30%) in asset allocation, combined with in-depth analysis of stock pledging scenarios, aiming to help students build a more robust financial structure. The teacher also provided a profound analysis of Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s day trading policies, revealing their potential harm to retail investors. Furthermore, the course content broadly touched upon life wisdom such as work value, personal growth, meditation, and mindfulness, and prospectively explored emerging financial trends like stablecoins and their potential impact on the future world order, offering students a broad perspective and deep thinking beyond investment itself.\nDisclaimer: This article is for personal learning notes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Theme of the Current Session # The core theme of this lecture is \u0026ldquo;What Does Market Volatility Have to Do with Me? Adhering to the Discipline and Wisdom of Long-Term Investing\u0026rdquo;. Teacher James emphasizes that investors should ignore short-term market fluctuations and not panic-sell stocks as a result. Correct asset allocation, sufficient cash reserves, and unwavering long-term conviction are key to navigating market cycles. Teacher James also reminds everyone to be wary of financial scams and provides specific guidance on issues such as stock pledging, leverage, taxation, and personal financial planning.\nII.

Everyone must be vigilant and not be deceived. Teacher James has only one Clubhouse account, ID: CLECchairman. Official Contact Methods: Clubhouse: Participate directly in lectures (Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s ID is CLECchairman, please verify). Email: changeismoney@gmail.com and CRCdirectorgmail.com. Provided at the end of the briefing. YouTube comments. Facebook comments. Teacher James will not proactively contact students. Any proactive contact requesting information or offering investment guidance is a scam. Core Investment Philosophy: Market Volatility Has Nothing to Do with Me # Don\u0026rsquo;t Sell Stocks: Market volatility is normal and irrelevant to the goals of long-term investors; do not sell stocks because of it. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t sell stocks, don\u0026rsquo;t sell stocks, don\u0026rsquo;t sell stocks\u0026rdquo; is the core discipline. Importance of Asset Allocation: Proper asset allocation (e.g., retirees at least 30% cash, or 10-15 years of living expenses; young people at least 1 year of living expenses in cash) ensures a worry-free life during extreme market conditions (such as the 10-year market downturn after the 2000 tech bubble), preventing panicked and reckless operations. For example, with 2% annual living expenses, holding 15 years of cash means 30% cash. If holding 40% cash, then there are 20 years of living expenses. Harm of Reckless Operations: Some people panic due to market declines after pledging stocks, and their reckless operations lead to difficult situations. If you have enough cash and don\u0026rsquo;t operate recklessly, there won\u0026rsquo;t be problems. Understanding Market Phenomena: Physical Phenomenon vs. Chemical Phenomenon: Events like tariff wars are physical phenomena (like blowing up a balloon, there\u0026rsquo;s push and pull, eventually finding an equilibrium), not chemical phenomena (permanent change, irreversible). Therefore, short-term factors like international situations, market analysis, financial reports, economic conditions, and celebrity remarks (e.g., Trump\u0026rsquo;s speeches) are irrelevant to long-term investment strategy. Beware of Inner \u0026ldquo;Demons and Monsters\u0026rdquo;: When thoughts like \u0026ldquo;What should I do if the market drops next?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;The market keeps rising, I should sell some and buy back when it falls?\u0026rdquo; arise, these are inner \u0026ldquo;demons and monsters\u0026rdquo; at play, a very dangerous signal, and such thinking should stop immediately. When you think, \u0026ldquo;Wow, I\u0026rsquo;ve made so much money, I\u0026rsquo;ve struck it rich, I\u0026rsquo;m wealthy!\u0026rdquo; this is also a dangerous signal; greed has appeared. When you think, \u0026ldquo;How can it keep falling like this? What if the market drops to zero, what will I do?\u0026rdquo; this is the emergence of the \u0026ldquo;demon\u0026rdquo; of fear. Greed and fear stem from feelings about the market. View the market like a variety show; financial media and analysts are like hosts and guests—just laugh it off. If you can watch market fluctuations (like a 10% rise or fall in a day) without any inner turmoil, then you can pay attention to the market. The goal is \u0026ldquo;it will definitely rise in 20 years\u0026rdquo;; short-term corrections are normal. Investment Education and Disclaimer # Educational Purpose: All videos and sharing are for educational purposes only, with no profit-making intent, and are for reference only. Personal Responsibility: Investing is a personal act. Teacher James is not a professional investment advisor or tax professional; all decisions are your own responsibility. Stress Test: Ask yourself daily, \u0026ldquo;If the market drops to zero, is your cash sufficient? Can you still live for one, two, or three years? Can young people continue working, and can retirees still withdraw money from the ATM?\u0026rdquo; Use this to test the robustness of your asset allocation. How to Learn and Access Resources # Clubhouse Message Board: Scroll to the top for the day\u0026rsquo;s briefing and related links. YouTube Comment Section: Pinned comment has related links. Learning Path for New Friends: Search \u0026ldquo;CLEC投资理财频道\u0026rdquo; (CLEC Investment and Finance Channel) on YouTube. Watch the \u0026ldquo;One Hundred Million Dollar Investment Lecture\u0026rdquo; playlist, starting from early videos like 00451, 00398, 00399, 00400, 00401, 00402, etc., to gradually understand the investment philosophy. Teacher James believes the investment and financial knowledge he shares is more complete and correct than most books on the market (many are \u0026ldquo;demons and monsters,\u0026rdquo; good books are few and hard to distinguish) and financial programs. Investment Discipline and Leverage Utilization # Wisdom and Destiny: Those who can watch the videos and follow through have wisdom and good destiny. Others watch, think they understand, but operate recklessly. Stock Pledging and Repayment: Once you pledge stocks and borrow money, you should be determined not to repay (the principal) for the rest of your life before you borrow. Otherwise, you should not pledge. Don\u0026rsquo;t Do What You Don\u0026rsquo;t Understand: Those who don\u0026rsquo;t understand financial tools like Beta, leverage, etc. (e.g., can\u0026rsquo;t even calculate Beta), should stick to investing only in index funds (like QQQ) and keep ample cash. 70% investment, 30% cash can also lead to a good life. Leverage is Not Essential: Leverage and stock pledging are ways to deeply understand financial operations, but they are not necessary conditions for wealth, suitable for a few who truly understand, are not afraid, and can withstand their volatility. Beware of Groups and Private Chats: Teacher James has no official groups. Any group using the CLEC name may be unauthorized or a scam. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s 00662 (Fubon NASDAQ) study group is student-initiated and not affiliated with the official CLEC; they also won\u0026rsquo;t use the CLEC banner. Be cautious when joining any group or engaging in private contact. Investment Targets and Global Allocation # Recommended Target: Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQQ and its corresponding ETFs in various regions, like Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s 00662). Don\u0026rsquo;t ask about other ETFs. Global Purchase Channels: A document (page 15) lists channels for purchasing Nasdaq 100 Index Funds globally (Canada, Australia, UK, Brazil, Europe, Malaysia, South Korea, etc.). Information Disclosure: Since entering YouTube in 2018, all information has been publicly available on YouTube, Podcasts, and other platforms. Before 2018, classes were in-person, meeting students every two weeks. Long-Term Optimism and Market Outlook # Always Extremely Optimistic, Always Sunny: Firmly believe the market will always rise and reach new highs. QQQ at $540 will definitely be surpassed; it might reach $50,000, $500,000 in the future (a 100-fold increase is a small case in the market). 00662 might reach NT$90,000, NT$900,000 in the future. Volatility is Not Risk: Market decline after buying is not a risk; not being in the market is the risk. Don\u0026rsquo;t regret not buying QQQ at $500 when it reaches $50,000. Looking back: In 2022, when QQQ hit a low of over $200, everyone was terrified. Now it\u0026rsquo;s over $500. The previous high of $408 was also called a high point; it was underwater for a year, and now it\u0026rsquo;s back and hitting new highs. So what if you buy at $540 and it drops? In a few years, you\u0026rsquo;ll be fine again. Investment Pace: Buy when you have money, invest in batches. Achieve the \u0026ldquo;golden mean\u0026rdquo; of being happy when it rises and comfortable when it falls (because you can buy cheaper shares). QQQ Performance Over the Past Year: Up 15.38%. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t made over 10% in the past year, you\u0026rsquo;re failing. You get this return even without active trading. Ignore recent volatility. During Trump\u0026rsquo;s tariff war, it fell over 20%, institutions fled, and ended up missing out later. Investors who have calmly weathered the year-to-date volatility are doing great. Case Analysis on Money Market Funds and Exchange Rate Fluctuations # Student Case Background: A student (email inquiry) mentioned a short-term \u0026ldquo;crazy 10% appreciation\u0026rdquo; of the NTD against the USD (Teacher James pointed out it should be \u0026ldquo;depreciation,\u0026rdquo; but the subsequent discussion revolved around the student\u0026rsquo;s sense of \u0026ldquo;loss,\u0026rdquo; suggesting the student meant NTD appreciation led to a relative drop in the NTD value of their USD assets). The student held 00864B (a USD bond ETF) and experienced a paper \u0026ldquo;loss\u0026rdquo; due to exchange rate changes. He also mentioned pledging over NT$30 million and borrowing NT$6.6 million (20%), which Teacher James criticized as \u0026ldquo;courting disaster\u0026rdquo; behavior—pledging and immediately borrowing to reinvest. A slight 10% drop in the market (referring to the value of USD assets relative to NTD) caused him to panic. Student\u0026rsquo;s Questions: Should the 00864B portion not be transferred to 00865B? (Because a transfer would mean \u0026ldquo;immediate loss\u0026rdquo;) Will the USD continue to depreciate against the NTD? Should the money market funds remain in 00864B? Can 00864B be transferred to 00662 (QQQ)? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Analysis and Criticism: Human Fragility and Ignorance is Bliss: The student\u0026rsquo;s behavior exposed pretending to understand, reckless bravery born of ignorance (like pledging and immediately borrowing a large sum to reinvest), and human fragility in the face of real market volatility (even currency fund exchange rate fluctuations). Like the \u0026ldquo;Boxers\u0026rdquo; (义和团), not learning leads to being plundered. Prohibition on Borrowing to Immediately Reinvest: Repeatedly emphasized that borrowing against pledged stock, especially a large one-time sum for reinvestment, is extremely dangerous. Short-term Exchange Rates are Unpredictable: Even the US central bank cannot predict short-term exchange rates and interest rates; investors should not worry about this. Financial media predictions are either from charlatans or liars. Act Immediately, Forget Sunk Costs: If a fund switch is necessary (00864B to 00865B, assuming it\u0026rsquo;s a similar but superior fund), act immediately. Don\u0026rsquo;t consider so-called \u0026ldquo;losses\u0026rdquo; or wait to \u0026ldquo;break even.\u0026rdquo; This is kindergarten-level financial thinking. 00864B and 00865B (if similar assets) will move mostly in tandem; waiting for one to break even means the other will have risen too. Severe Misconception of Risk: Being scared by a 4% paper \u0026ldquo;loss\u0026rdquo; in a very low-volatility money market fund (or short-term bond ETF) due to short-term exchange rate fluctuations, to the point of wanting to switch to a highly volatile stock fund (00662), is a massive risk perception error. QQQ/00662 could fall 80% within 10 years. Role of Cash: Cash (held in money market funds) is like the \u0026ldquo;air force\u0026rdquo; in a strategy, protecting ground troops (stock investments like QQQ/00662 and leveraged funds). The air force cannot be used as infantry. Those Unable to Bear Volatility Should Not Invest: If one cannot even bear minor exchange rate fluctuations in a money market fund (like the 10% perceived by the student) and panics because of it, then one is not suited for investing at all and should leave the market immediately, or face bankruptcy sooner or later. Long-term Exchange Rate Mean Reversion: In the long run (e.g., observed over 30 years), NTD exchange rate fluctuations will tend towards a mean (e.g., within a 22%-30% range up or down). As long as USD assets are held long enough (e.g., over 10 years), the expected return on USD assets (e.g., 3% annual money market yield, 34% over 10 years) far outweighs potential losses from exchange rate fluctuations. Market Volatility Has Nothing to Do with Me: If this exchange rate fluctuation makes you nervous, it shows you are not suited for investing. Asset Allocation and the Importance of Cash # Cash Requirement for Pledged Loans: When taking out stock-pledged loans, the cash (or cash equivalents) held should, under certain models, especially initially or when the market hasn\u0026rsquo;t fallen significantly, be greater than the loan amount. Teacher James mentioned his 433 model (40% QQQ, 30% leverage, 30% cash) where, after an 80% market drop, cash might be close to or slightly less than the loan, but the overall position remains safe. If this is uncomfortable, a more conservative allocation like 424 (40% QQQ, 20% leverage, 40% cash) or 505 (50% QQQ, 50% cash, smart rebalancing) can be chosen. Minimum 30% Cash: At least 30% of investable assets should be allocated to cash (or money market funds). This is the first step. If you don\u0026rsquo;t understand why you need cash, you cannot invest; you will go bankrupt. Cash as Living Expenses Standard: For working individuals, 30% cash should cover at least one year of living expenses. If funds are insufficient to cover one year\u0026rsquo;s living expenses, one should not invest. Young people, after starting work, should first save a one-year emergency fund; subsequent salary can then be invested. Investment Horizon: Investing is a plan for 10+ years. Money needed within 10 years (e.g., children\u0026rsquo;s tuition, down payment for a house) should not be used for high-volatility investments. Risks and Conditions for Buying Property: Not recommended for young people to buy property easily, unless they have sufficient cash flow or can buy two houses as easily as buying slippers (with the mentality of buying a new pair if one breaks). Concentrating investment in a single property is extremely risky (e.g., earthquake risk), violating the principle of diversification (QQQ diversifies across 100 companies). The financial industry generally claims one should not concentrate bets or gamble on individual stocks, yet encourages the public to buy property (concentrated investment). This is contradictory; many practitioners either don\u0026rsquo;t understand or are \u0026ldquo;scammers.\u0026rdquo; Teacher James mentioned being invited by a Taiwanese TV station to talk against buying property but declined, unwilling to become a public target. Learn Investment Philosophy, Not Mimicry: Learn from masters like Buffett, Peter Lynch their investment philosophy (e.g., don\u0026rsquo;t fear market volatility; Buffett encountered market drops of 10%+ annually and 20%+ every five years), not their specific stock-picking methods or asset allocation ratios. You can never mimic them. Cash for Retirees: Cash reserves need to cover 10+ years of expenses, ensuring that even if the market (e.g., QQQ/00662) goes to zero in an extreme scenario, and leveraged funds also go to zero, you can still live comfortably and at ease. Where to Keep Cash: In Taiwan, it\u0026rsquo;s 00865B; in the US, it\u0026rsquo;s BIL or SGOV, etc. (money market funds). Other Important Tips # Taiwan Tax Reference: Mentioned a PDF file from Cathay United Bank regarding Taiwan taxes. Tools like ChatGPT can assist in understanding, but questions need to be logical, and AI answers are for reference only, not to be fully trusted. Teacher James stated his trained ChatGPT has not yet reached AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) level. Proactive Learning: When encountering problems, first search for information and learn independently. Don\u0026rsquo;t treat Teacher James as a secretary or search engine. For example, what a money market fund is, you should look it up yourself. If you still don\u0026rsquo;t understand after researching, you can list what you found and your confusion when asking. Your Biggest Enemy is Yourself: The best antidote to inner fear and greed is robust asset allocation and an ample cash level. When greedy, hold onto cash; when fearful, hold onto stocks. Asset allocation itself is to mitigate risk. Health and Longevity are Paramount: Health and longevity are key to achieving wealth compounding. Buffett is Buffett largely because he lived into his 90s. 96% of his wealth was earned after age 60 (a 25-fold increase in 30 years, about 11% annualized, similar to SPY). If you live that long with QQQ, your asset growth will be far more than 25 times, possibly 100 times. Volatility is the Entry Fee: View short-term paper \u0026ldquo;losses\u0026rdquo; from market volatility as an entry fee to the market, or \u0026ldquo;withholding tax\u0026rdquo; (it will be returned to you later), not a fine. Missing out on market upswings by not being in the market is a permanent loss (e.g., missing the 10 best days in the past 20 years might yield only 25% of the total return, while staying in the market could yield 17 times). III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Lucy # Question 1: In Canada, investing in QQQ monthly, but bank (RBC/TD) transaction fees are high (approx. 9.99 CAD/trade), which is not cost-effective for small regular investments. Asks if there are low-fee platforms? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Recommends checking the message board; some students have recommended WealthSimple or Interactive Brokers (IBKR). Other student (Lin) adds: Questrade, if it\u0026rsquo;s a self-directed account and meets asset requirements (e.g., 10,000 CAD+), might offer free trading. National Bank\u0026rsquo;s brokerage services might also offer free trading and can link to bank accounts for direct transfers. Other student (unnamed male) adds: Questrade\u0026rsquo;s mobile trading platform might offer free commissions under certain conditions and has a regular investment feature, but specific fees need confirmation. Question 2: When buying Canadian QQQ ETFs, some are Hedged (HG), some are Non-Hedged (NH), how to choose? QQC vs QQQ selection? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: For Canadian investors, recommends buying HXQ.TO. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t pay dividends (dividends are reinvested), avoiding withholding tax issues, and it\u0026rsquo;s Hedged. Other student (Lin) adds: QQC.TO (CAD-denominated) allows purchasing fractional shares, suitable for small regular investments (e.g., 150 CAD monthly). HXQ.TO (currently around 80+ CAD per share) requires whole share purchases. Other student (unnamed male) adds: CAD-denominated QQC might have slightly higher gains than directly buying QQQ with USD due to currency conversion operations. Buying directly with CAD is also simpler for tax reporting. Question 3: What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between using a brokerage platform and a bank platform for trading? Teacher James and other students reply: Brokerage platforms are specialized investment accounts; a bank\u0026rsquo;s investment services might be an independent department or outsourced. In Canada and the US, there\u0026rsquo;s a firewall between brokerage and commercial banking. Using brokerage platforms directly (like Questrade, IBKR, WealthSimple) is usually more professional, and fees might be lower. Be aware that banks might try to sell packaged financial products; insist on buying pure ETFs. Watson # Sharing 1: Early on (2018), saw Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;One Hundred Million Dollar Investment Lecture\u0026rdquo; on Bilibili but didn\u0026rsquo;t think much of it. After years of ups and downs in A-shares and overseas investments (overseas funds invested for nearly 10 years without profit, until inventory at the beginning of this year). Now almost 50, feels like time was wasted. After re-encountering Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy (buy when you have money, hold to death, only buy never sell), took out a portfolio loan through HSBC Hong Kong, allocating 70% QQQ, 10% TQQQ, and 20% MME (should be META). Experienced a significant market pullback in April (TQQQ dropped from purchase price near $90 to $35), but because of belief in Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s philosophy, felt no inner turmoil, calm and composed, firmly believing volatility is not risk, and with proper asset allocation and cash reserves, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to fear. Studied nearly 200 of Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s lessons, moving from understanding to faith, believing in humanity, the US, and technology, enabling steadfast holding. Teacher James is a benefactor on his investment journey. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Thanks for sharing, excellent mentality. Sharing 2: Information on HSBC Hong Kong portfolio loans: Currently, one-month HIBOR is about 1.2%, plus the bank\u0026rsquo;s spread, total interest is no more than 2.4%, very low. At HSBC, BIL (should be SGOV or similar short-term Treasury ETF) and leveraged funds (TQQQ, etc.) cannot be used as collateral, but SGOV can, with a loan-to-value ratio up to 90%; QQQ\u0026rsquo;s LTV is 70%. SGOV dividends are subject to 10% withholding tax (for mainland China residents after signing W8 form), but since it\u0026rsquo;s US Treasury interest, it\u0026rsquo;s theoretically tax-exempt, and HSBC will refund this 10% in March/April of the following year. This method of not selling stocks, not repaying principal, and not paying interest (referring to net interest cost) through pledging is very helpful for mainland Chinese investors to avoid taxes on overseas investment income (dividends, capital gains) being investigated (recently discussed on Xueqiu), because as long as you don\u0026rsquo;t sell, there are no realized capital gains or dividends. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: This method (not selling, pledging to borrow) is applicable to investors worldwide and can legally avoid many taxes. The key is \u0026ldquo;buy when you have money, hold to death, never repay stock-pledged loans (principal), and borrow (through asset allocation) without paying (net) interest.\u0026rdquo; Watson broke through the psychological barrier of \u0026ldquo;why borrow money when I have cash,\u0026rdquo; understanding that cash is also an asset that needs to continuously grow. Question: If one withdraws no more than 2% from pledged assets annually for living expenses, and this 2% is not fully used, should the remaining portion be left as is (not borrowed), or can the unused portion of the borrowed money be reinvested into the QQQ/TQQQ portfolio? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Either is fine. Reinvesting the unused portion is okay, not reinvesting is also fine; whatever makes you comfortable. If the market is falling, you can buy; if the market is rising, you can ignore it. The core is to buy when you have money, at the market price, immediately. Since you are already financially free, the extra funds just increase your inheritance, not a necessary operation. Ray # Sharing: After rewatching Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s videos, his investment philosophy has improved greatly. Fortunate to be able to jump directly from ignorance to a state of \u0026ldquo;non-action\u0026rdquo; (wu wei), skipping the intermediate stages of \u0026ldquo;not knowing one is ignorant,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;cleverness,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;from non-action to action.\u0026rdquo; Question 1: Teacher James once said wealth has tiers (million for food freedom, ten million for financial freedom, one hundred million for housing freedom and helping family, one billion for helping the poor, ten billion for helping society/seeking longevity). The \u0026ldquo;hold to death\u0026rdquo; strategy might cause assets to fluctuate significantly between these tiers (e.g., from 100 million down to 30 million). How to psychologically overcome the feeling of falling from a higher freedom tier, even knowing it\u0026rsquo;s temporary volatility? (For example, eating without looking at prices when assets are high, then reflecting on not being so complacent when assets fall back.) Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: The key is to focus on cash flow rather than short-term fluctuations in total assets. Whether working or retired, your annual disposable cash flow should be relatively fixed (e.g., annual income 3 million, spend 1.2 million, reinvest 1.8 million), unaffected by market ups and downs. Don\u0026rsquo;t change your spending habits because of market fluctuations. If you want to increase living expenses due to significant asset growth (e.g., from 60 million to 120 million) (e.g., from 2% of original assets to 2% of new assets, increasing cash flow from 1.2 million to 2.4 million, spending an extra 1.2 million), you should first re-evaluate and adjust your asset allocation (e.g., reduce Beta from 1.0 to lower, increase cash proportion) to ensure the new cash flow plan is sustainable. After that, your life should no longer be affected by market volatility. Question 2: Why is the rebalancing frequency chosen as once a year? (Saw an author who tried different frequencies and concluded there\u0026rsquo;s no optimum, once a year is about right.) Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Once a year is based on intuition and common sense. Two years is too long, volatility might be too great, reducing rebalancing efficiency (e.g., if it rises 50% this year, annual rebalancing is efficient; over two years, volatility might be smoothed out, reducing efficiency). Daily rebalancing is theoretically most efficient but impractical (becomes short-term trading) and incurs high transaction costs and tax issues. Once a year strikes a good balance between efficiency and practicability, and also aligns well with tax reporting (e.g., in the US). Yao # Sharing: Observed that the market mostly rises slowly (e.g., 0.x% daily, leveraged funds 1.x%), but when it falls (e.g., president talks about trade war), the decline is larger (5%, 10%, 20%). This is like life, mostly mundane daily routines, but long-term accumulation (power of compounding) can lead to huge changes. Work hard, live well, and you can ultimately lead a happy life. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Well said. Plainness is a blessing, safety first, stable profits. Without safety, everything else is false; without health, everything else is false. Health and safety are prerequisites for enjoying wealth. Like the example of Bill Gates (or Steve Jobs), his high school had an expensive computer (a one-in-ten-thousand chance of luck), and he learned programming; but another equally talented classmate unfortunately died while mountain climbing (a one-in-ten-thousand chance of disaster). One must first avoid disaster for luck to be meaningful. Lin # Sharing: Watched the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting. Warren Buffett, though 94 years old (born 1930) and having experienced WWII and countless storms, repeatedly emphasized four or five times within three to four hours how lucky he was to be born in America as a white male. This echoes Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on \u0026ldquo;always be optimistic, embrace the sunshine.\u0026rdquo; If I hadn\u0026rsquo;t listened to Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s classes, I might not have understood Buffett\u0026rsquo;s expression and would have found it insincere. Now I understand; he certainly had bad things happen in his life, but he chose optimism. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Very well said. Be grateful every day, stay optimistic, think positively (\u0026ldquo;I am great, I am good, I am very rich, all the money in the world is mine\u0026rdquo;), and the universe will respond to your positive energy. The world is as you perceive it. Supplement on Canadian brokerage information: Questrade, if it\u0026rsquo;s a self-directed account and meets asset requirements (e.g., 10,000 CAD+, annual management fee might be waived), offers zero-commission trading. National Bank\u0026rsquo;s brokerage services might also offer free trading (mainly starting in French-speaking regions). HXQ.TO must be bought in whole shares, QQC.TO can be bought in fractional shares, suitable for small regular investments (e.g., only 150 CAD per month, HXQ.TO is over 80 CAD per share, so can only buy one share). Jason # Sharing 1: Before and after attending the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting, encountered two groups of people: one group was value investors like Li Lu, who emphasized ignoring market volatility (Mr. Market\u0026rsquo;s emotions), believing index investing is also a form of value investing (natural growth of the economy after removing speculation). They also emphasized community support, making an annual \u0026ldquo;pilgrimage\u0026rdquo; to Omaha. Sharing 2: The other group was insurance agents, also using Buffett\u0026rsquo;s theories (Berkshire Hathaway has insurance business), discussing asset management, inheritance, financial literacy education (e.g., allocating 401k, Roth IRA), but their ultimate goal was to sell life insurance. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Be wary of insurance agents. Insurance is transferring your money to the insurance company\u0026rsquo;s pocket; it\u0026rsquo;s essentially \u0026ldquo;the scam group within the financial scam conglomerate.\u0026rdquo; Buffett says insurance is a good business—for the insurance company, not for the policyholder. Insurance agents use financial literacy education as a disguise, making it highly deceptive. Haojin # Question: Taiwanese products offer good value for money (e.g., Meet Fresh is $10 in the US, Taiwan has many cheaper options), but the NTD seems undervalued. If the NTD appreciates significantly in the future as Teacher James suggested (e.g., from 30:1 USD to 15:1 or even 10:1), for Taiwanese investors in US stock ETFs (like 00662, with an annualized return of about 12-14%), will their long-term returns denominated in NTD be eroded by exchange rates, leading to less-than-expected growth in purchasing power? (A boss\u0026rsquo;s mentality might be to hope for NTD depreciation to benefit exports, sacrificing employee welfare). Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: NTD appreciation is good for Taiwan. It will be cheaper for people to buy imported goods (e.g., iPhone from NT$30,000 to NT$10,000) and travel abroad, improving quality of life. High-pollution, uncompetitive industries (like uncompetitive steel, unless for national defense) will naturally be eliminated; they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be subsidized by sacrificing public welfare and the environment. For Taiwanese investors already invested in USD assets, NTD appreciation will indeed affect NTD-denominated returns. However, one can consider allocating to some NTD-hedged ETFs (like Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s 00670L Fubon NASDAQ Leveraged 2x, although it\u0026rsquo;s a leveraged ETF, Teacher James might be referring to its hedging characteristic here or using it as an example that such tools exist). In the long run, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations is far less than the growth of quality assets. Even if the annualized return drops from 14% to 7% due to exchange rates, it\u0026rsquo;s still a good return. One shouldn\u0026rsquo;t worry excessively about exchange rates. After NTD appreciation, buying USD assets in the future will be cheaper (e.g., QQQ from NT$15,000 to NT$5,000), which is actually beneficial. An undervalued NTD deprives the entire population of welfare to benefit a few manufacturers. Curiosity # Question: Regarding Roth portions in tax-deferred retirement accounts like 403(b) and 457(b) (up to $30,500 can be contributed annually), are they also subject to Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) at age 73 or 75? If so, can they be rolled over tax-free to a personal Roth IRA account without an amount limit? What are the precautions during operation (e.g., need to sell then transfer)? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Funds in Roth 403(b)/457(b), after meeting conditions, can be rolled over tax-free to a personal Roth IRA. This avoids RMD issues because personal Roth IRAs do not have RMDs during the owner\u0026rsquo;s lifetime. Operationally, contact the brokerage to handle it; you can choose cash transfer or in-kind transfer (assets transferred directly, if the brokerage supports it and the investment holdings are the same, like QQQ). It\u0026rsquo;s advisable to choose the brokerage link option within 403(b)/457(b) as much as possible to invest in quality targets like QQQ, rather than being limited to a few poor-performing funds offered by the plan. If you can only choose funds, don\u0026rsquo;t contribute; deposit directly into a Roth IRA. Catherine # Question: Regarding Pledged Line of Credit (PLOC), a friend doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand why one would borrow money and pay interest when having enough cash or stock gains. How to simply explain its benefits? (Friend\u0026rsquo;s argument: I have money from stock trading, why borrow and pay interest?) Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Capital Efficiency and Compounding: Using your own money for living expenses (e.g., spending $20,000 annually) means reducing the principal available for investment. Borrowing for living expenses (e.g., borrowing $20,000) allows the original principal (e.g., $1 million) to continue growing at a higher rate (e.g., 10%). Even after paying interest (e.g., 5%), there\u0026rsquo;s still a net gain (5% arbitrage). After 30 years, the borrower\u0026rsquo;s net worth (total assets minus debt) will be far higher than that of the investor who spends their own money (Teacher James gave an example, the former has $3 million more). Tax Advantages: Not selling stocks means no capital gains tax. Possibility of Interest Deduction: Interest on loans may be tax-deductible under specific circumstances (e.g., treating long-term capital gains as short-term, forgoing preferential tax rates) (complex operation, consult a professional accountant; many accountants don\u0026rsquo;t understand this). Net Interest Cost is Zero or Negative: Through proper asset allocation (like Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s 433 model: 40% QQQ, 30% QLD/TQQQ, 30% cash/money market fund), the interest generated by money market funds (e.g., $300,000 cash generating 4.5% or $13,500 interest) can cover or even exceed the interest expense of pledged loans (e.g., borrowing $200,000, 5% interest is $10,000), achieving \u0026ldquo;borrowing money without paying interest\u0026rdquo; or even making money, while the portfolio\u0026rsquo;s Beta remains at 1.0. Long-term Asset Growth and Risk (Counter-intuitive): Over the long term, the total assets of an investor who borrows will be far higher than one who spends their own money. Continuously spending principal leads to principal depletion (e.g., $1 million becomes $400,000 after 30 years, then $100,000 after another 10 years, unable to afford a bento box). Borrowing and letting the principal grow continuously, even with debt, results in better sustainability of total assets (still $1 million principal growing) and cash flow, thus lower risk. Teacher James emphasized this is one of his core strategies, requiring students to watch the videos from the beginning to fully understand. IV. Wonderful Quotes # Market volatility has nothing to do with us, so don\u0026rsquo;t sell stocks, don\u0026rsquo;t sell stocks, don\u0026rsquo;t sell stocks. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis view is a core investment discipline repeatedly emphasized by Teacher James: maintain composure in the face of market volatility and stick to the strategy of long-term holding of quality assets.\nYou only run into problems if you are afraid. If you sell your stocks, always remember one thing: keep enough cash. Retirees might need to keep 10-15 years\u0026rsquo; worth, at least 30% or more in cash. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nTeacher James stresses the importance of ample cash reserves for overcoming fear and avoiding erroneous operations, providing cash reserve suggestions for different groups of people.\nGreed and fear are like that. Because you feel the market, it causes your greed\u0026hellip; you find your assets have exploded\u0026hellip; you\u0026rsquo;re about to become a superior person, then greed has appeared, and risk will follow. When the market drops, you become very fearful, very fearful, very fearful\u0026hellip; then this fear emerges. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nProfoundly reveals the common extreme emotions of investors in the market and their dangers, reminding investors to remain rational.\nCash is air. You must maintain the highest level of cash to survive. In the overall strategy, cash is like the air force, protecting the ground troops from annihilation. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nUses a vivid metaphor to emphasize the strategic position of cash in an investment portfolio, as key to resisting risk and ensuring survival.\nOur method isn\u0026rsquo;t just for China; even if you\u0026rsquo;re in Taiwan or the US, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to pay taxes because we don\u0026rsquo;t sell. No selling means no taxes. Learn this trick: stock pledge loans are never repaid (principal), and the loan (through asset allocation) incurs no (net) interest. \u0026ndash; Teacher James (partially echoing Watson\u0026rsquo;s sharing)\nExplains the strategy of achieving tax optimization and wealth growth through long-term holding, not selling, and skillfully using stock pledge loans (combined with asset allocation to make interest costs manageable).\nYou just need to be optimistic, optimistic, I am great, I am good, I am very rich, all the money in the world is mine. You need to chant this every day: I am great, I am good. I am the best person in the world. That\u0026rsquo;s enough. All good luck will come to you. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nEmphasizes the importance of positive psychological suggestion and an optimistic mindset for investment and even life.\nWhen investing, you must treat the losses brought by volatility, these temporary losses, as the entry fee for the market, not a fine. \u0026ndash; Teacher James (quoting an online viewpoint)\nProvides a positive perspective on market volatility and short-term paper losses, helping investors maintain a long-term mindset.\nWe make money without paying taxes, borrow money without paying (net) interest, and we hold to death, never selling (principal). This is our highest realm. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nSummarizes the ideal state of his investment strategy, emphasizing tax efficiency, cost control, and long-term holding.\nV. Summary # In this lecture, Teacher James once again systematically emphasized his core investment philosophy: long-term holding of quality assets (like the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund), ignoring short-term market volatility and noise, maintaining sufficient cash reserves, and applying a reasonable asset allocation strategy. Teacher James sternly refuted panic and erroneous operations arising from short-term market or exchange rate fluctuations and detailed the correct use of stock pledge loans where \u0026ldquo;principal is never repaid, and (net) interest is controllable.\u0026rdquo; Through questions and sharing from multiple students, the lecture covered specific concerns of investors from different regions including Canada, Mainland China, Taiwan, and the US, touching upon brokerage selection, fees, tax planning, retirement account management, and overcoming psychological investment barriers. Teacher James consistently conveyed an extremely optimistic investment belief and reminded investors to be wary of financial scams, focus on learning correct investment knowledge, and ultimately achieve financial freedom and life happiness.\nDisclaimer: This article is for personal learning notes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Summary # Operations and Reminders # Clubhouse Hiatus Announcement: Clubhouse and video uploads will be suspended for the next two weeks (May 3rd and May 10th), resuming on May 17th (Saturday). Clubhouse Technical Issues: Recent issues with sound being inaudible or too low. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to leave and re-enter the room, or completely close and reopen the app. Speaking Rules: Accidental stage entries are fine, just stay on stage; no need to repeatedly enter and exit. Disclaimer: All sharing is for reference only. Investment decisions are the individual\u0026rsquo;s responsibility. We are not professional investment advisors or tax professionals; sharing is based on personal experience. Long-term investment has low risk, short-term investment has high risk. Those who cannot tolerate short-term losses or are worried about asset devaluation should not invest and can choose fixed deposits instead. Learning Resources: Lecture notes are pinned in the Clubhouse comment section or the YouTube comment section. Newcomers are advised to start with video 00451, then 398-402, and then the latest for systematic learning (although there are as many as four or five hundred videos). Community Groups: No official groups are established. Participation in unofficial groups requires caution. If the group information is noisy, annoying, and not beneficial to life, it is recommended to leave. Groups aimed at sharing CLEC concepts, helping each other answer questions, and providing information are welcome. Investment Philosophy and Strategies # Market Volatility is Normal: The market is always fluctuating; this is the unchanging rule. No need to analyze specific reasons (international situation, trade war, financial report forecasts, etc.). Many analysts themselves do not truly understand. The market is like the sea, unaffected by streams and storms. Long-Term Investing: True investment is buying with the intention of never selling. Intending to sell at a high point is speculation. Investment must be long-term. Index Investing: Core Recommendation: Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQQ and its global equivalents). Reason: Compared to the S\u0026amp;P 500 (500 companies, possibly 450 \u0026ldquo;bad companies\u0026rdquo;), the Nasdaq 100 focuses more on high-quality technology companies, aligning with the \u0026ldquo;the bigger, the stronger\u0026rdquo; trend. Retirees/Those with Less Capital: Consider Taiwan 0056 or US SPHD (dividend yield ~3.5%, providing stable cash flow). Nasdaq 100 ETF List: Provides a list of relevant ETFs including various countries (Canada HXQ.t, Singapore, Malaysia, Norway, UK, Australia, etc.). HXQ.t is recommended because it does not pay dividends (tax-free). Historical Experience: Watching videos since 2018 can provide insights into investor sentiment and responses during market fluctuations, giving a sense of the long-term perspective. Stay Optimistic: Investors need to be extremely optimistic, always facing the sunlight, believing that the market will be good in the long run, even if there is a world war, the market still exists and continues to rise (only rises, never falls). Investment Target Selection: 00864B vs 00865B (Taiwan Bond ETF): 00864B: Pays dividends, generating National Health Insurance Supplementary Premium (2.11%), requires manual reinvestment (with handling fees, easy to forget resulting in no compounding), dividends are considered overseas income (requires declaration if it exceeds the limit, but usually not a problem with annual income below NT$1 million; according to student feedback, it is exempt from the second-generation health insurance supplementary premium). 00865B: Does not pay dividends, avoiding the above problems, simpler and more effective in the long run. Low trading volume is not a problem (market makers provide liquidity), initial performance differences will shrink as scale increases. Strongly recommend switching to 00865B; convenience is a value. Conversion will incur a one-time transaction cost, but worth it in the long run. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/B): Not recommended for investment. Reason: Actively managed fund, more volatile than the index; times are changing, performance has lagged behind the S\u0026amp;P 500; uncertainty after Buffett (\u0026ldquo;the devil will come out\u0026rdquo;); learning Buffett should be about learning his long-term investment spirit, investment discourse (such as the definition of investment), rather than stock picking. Investing in the S\u0026amp;P 500 may be better than investing in BRK. Asset Allocation (Beta): Basic Principle: It is recommended that most people allocate an investment portfolio with a Beta value of less than 1, such as 70% index funds + 30% cash/money market funds (Beta is approximately 0.7). Risk Tolerance: The recent 20% drop has made many people uncomfortable (even those with a Beta of 1.2 configured at 4:4:2), indicating that actual risk tolerance may be lower than expected. Do not sacrifice the comfort of holding enough cash (\u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t gamble with the money you need for the money you don\u0026rsquo;t need\u0026rdquo;) for an extra 1-2% of return. Adjustment: If the initial Beta is high (such as 1.2), it is recommended to review it at the end of each year. If the market rises, you can sell part of the leveraged/index position and supplement the cash to more than 30%, gradually reducing the Beta to below 1.0. Consider smart rebalancing after the Beta is below 1.0. Platform Interaction: Please subscribe, like, and leave comments on videos on various platforms. AI Development Fantasies and Impact # AI Optimized Future: Productivity greatly improved, most output is completed by AI (robots), and the cost of goods approaches zero. Total social wealth accelerates, basic living needs (food, clothing, housing, transportation) may be free, uniformly supplied by the state/society (AI robots complete production, construction, and maintenance). Social Structure Changes: Classes Still Exist: Capitalists: Earn profits by investing in and holding the means of production (AI systems) without labor; the wealthiest. Everyone can become a capitalist (just need to know how to invest). High-Tech Workers: Personnel who maintain and manage AI systems, with excellent income, can enjoy entertainment beyond basic needs (such as space travel), but may fall into the \u0026ldquo;cared-for\u0026rdquo; class if they stop working and do not become capitalists. Cared-For Class (approximately 80%): No need to work, basic life is guaranteed (food, clothing, housing, transportation, medical care), but cannot enjoy additional entertainment or resources. The standard of living may be similar to the current upper-middle class, but without work. Philosophical Challenges: When most people do not need to contribute for livelihood (\u0026ldquo;nothing to serve\u0026rdquo;), what is the meaning and purpose of life? (Analogous to being idle after retirement). May lead to widespread depression or social problems. Human development may enter a stage of eternal life, facing greater philosophical and existential questions. The focus should shift from \u0026ldquo;unemployment\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;the meaning of life.\u0026rdquo; Implications for Investors: As capitalists, there is no need to worry about job loss due to AI development; on the contrary, they will become wealthier. Start investing now to become part of the capitalist class. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Jacel # Question: SPY and QQQ have risen for three days, will they continue to rise or fall next week? James\u0026rsquo; Response: Short-term market cannot be predicted, like flipping a coin. We invest for the long term (20+ years), focusing on long-term trends. Buy when you have money, never sell. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to predict next week\u0026rsquo;s market; ask the temple or the \u0026ldquo;stock god\u0026rdquo; in Clubhouse. Sharing: Just started learning from the teacher\u0026rsquo;s course two months ago, introduced by a friend in the United States. Currently in the learning stage, and has invested in some QQQ (cost between 515-530). After returning to Taiwan, considering investing in 00662. In the process of canceling previous insurance and converting individual stocks to 00662. Question: Should I invest in US stocks (Firstrade account, worried about political risks in Taiwan for the child) or Taiwan stocks 00662? How to allocate at the beginning? James\u0026rsquo; Response: Recommend investing in 00662 in Taiwan, no need to use a US broker (Firstrade). It\u0026rsquo;s better for the child to rely on themselves rather than worry about politics. When starting to learn, it is recommended to divide the total funds into three parts: 1/3 buy 00662 immediately, 1/3 buy in batches over the next 3-6 months, and 1/3 hold in cash. The ultimate goal is 70% 00662 + 30% cash. Then slowly learn whether and how to allocate leveraged funds (adjust the Beta value to 0.8-0.9). Nibalao # Question 1: Who are QQQ and SPHD suitable for in terms of capital size? James\u0026rsquo; Response: (Points out that students should watch the videos for repeated questions) This is a consideration for retirees. Need to calculate annual expenses after retirement. If 50 times the expenses equals your total assets, you can invest in QQQ (equivalent to a 2% annual withdrawal rate). If 2% is not enough, you need 3%, you may consider the S\u0026amp;P 500. Only consider SPHD if you need even higher (~3.5-4%). Non-retirees should prioritize the high-growth QQQ. Question 2: Explain Beta value. Beta=1 is synchronized with the market? Beta=1.2 is 1.2 times the volatility? Is the Beta of an 80% QQQ + 20% SGOV portfolio 0.8? James\u0026rsquo; Response: Basic understanding is correct. Beta measures the volatility of an asset relative to the market. The Beta of an 80/20 portfolio is approximately 0.8. (Reminds again that the videos explain it) Question 3: Will the principal of SGOV (Short-Term US Treasury ETF) fall and lose money? James\u0026rsquo; Response: The principal risk is extremely low, almost no losses (except for minor fluctuations before and after dividend payments). SGOV invests in short-term Treasury bills (T-Bills) issued by the US Treasury Department with a maturity of 0-3 months (or within one year), backed by the credit of the United States. Rui # Sharing: Joined for more than a month and reviewed the market decline in 2022 and the teacher\u0026rsquo;s videos (especially #398 graduation episode, learned investment psychology). Question 1: In January 2023 (#401), the teacher used technical indicators (50/100-day moving average crossover) to judge the market bottom and predict that 2023 would be a bull market, which was also verified afterwards. However, in later videos (#491), he emphasized not to predict market cycles and not to look at macroeconomic indicators (prosperity signals, macroeconomics, inventory cycles, etc.). Why this change? Are these indicators really useless in the long run? What was the basis for judging the bottom (just because of being optimistic about the stock market)? Should we just follow discipline and rebalance once a year? James\u0026rsquo; Response: QQQ includes many industries (semiconductors, software, AI, biotechnology, retail such as Costco, Pepsico, Amazon, Google, Apple, etc.), and indicators for a single industry or country (such as Taiwan semiconductor economy, Taiwan prosperity signals, US prosperity signals) cannot reflect the overall index. Looking at all indicators is the same as looking at the index itself, so it is better to just focus on QQQ. The judgment in early 2023 was based on 40 years of experience (calculated that the 6-month moving average would cross upward), which is difficult to convey (\u0026ldquo;unspeakable\u0026rdquo;), and teaching technical analysis may cause students to misuse it and be harmed (\u0026ldquo;go crazy\u0026rdquo;), so it is not taught. Adhering to long-term investment discipline and holding enough cash buffer (such as 30%) is a more reliable method. Even if judging the bottom at that time, all cash would not be invested (such as still maintaining Beta 0.7), still maintaining a margin of safety. No need to take too much risk for small potential gains (referring to Buffett\u0026rsquo;s philosophy). Question 2: About the currency hedging of 00670L (Taiwan Leveraged QQQ ETF). Is the impact of exchange rate fluctuations significant in the long run? If the US dollar falls sharply (such as 1:13 against the Taiwan dollar), how will 00670L perform? (The teacher mentioned before that 00670L performs poorly when the US dollar rises) James\u0026rsquo; Response: 00670L is usually paired with 00865B (cash/short-term bonds). Exchange rate fluctuations have a hedging effect on both (when the US dollar rises, the hedging cost of 00670L increases, but the value of US dollar assets increases; the opposite is true when the US dollar falls). In the long run, exchange rate fluctuations are normal (such as the Taiwan dollar fluctuating between 28-32), but there is no fixed trend, and the expected value is zero. Currency hedging itself has a cost (wasting funds), which may not be necessary in the long run (it is recommended that fund companies consider canceling it), but the ETF is designed that way, and it does not hurt. The key is whether 00670L can achieve approximately twice the return of 00662 in the long run. Mike # Sharing: Trump mentioned that 5.6 trillion in foreign investment may be invested in the United States in the future (may be exaggerated, even if halved, 2.8 trillion is also considerable), but the direction is beneficial to AI and QQQ. Observed that QQQ rebounded more strongly than SPY, DIA, and BRK recently, confirming the teacher\u0026rsquo;s point of view (such as Katy Wood investing in AI-related companies when she saw mobile internet access). Compare the leadership styles of Chinese and American leaders (leader vs. manager) and the direction of attracting foreign investment (Saudi Arabia/Dubai vs. Myanmar/Vietnam/Malaysia). Question: Please explain the difference between CIPS (Chinese RMB Cross-Border Payment System) and SWIFT. Why is CIPS faster (completed in 6 seconds)? Why does SWIFT take days? Can SWIFT be improved? Will this affect the status of the US dollar (AI replied that the two will coexist)? James\u0026rsquo; Response: SWIFT is based on the traditional telegram transmission model (like a relay station), and information needs to be transferred through multiple layers (local bank -\u0026gt; regional major bank -\u0026gt; central bank -\u0026gt; SWIFT center (Switzerland) -\u0026gt; the other party\u0026rsquo;s central bank -\u0026gt; the other party\u0026rsquo;s head office -\u0026gt; the other party\u0026rsquo;s branch), involving compliance checks (anti-money laundering), time difference, manual processing, etc., so it takes a long time (2+ days). CIPS is a modern real-time gross settlement system, similar to domestic payment systems in various countries, point-to-point or directly cleared through the central bank, and the speed is fast. CIPS uses RMB and is an alternative developed to deal with SWIFT being weaponized (such as sanctions against Russia), making people distrust the US dollar system. US sanctions opened a Pandora\u0026rsquo;s box. Currently, CIPS is small (such as shipbuilding transactions between Malaysia and China), but it represents the trend of \u0026ldquo;currency wars\u0026rdquo; (such as Saudi Arabia and China being linked). Trump\u0026rsquo;s visit to Saudi Arabia may be related to maintaining the status of the US dollar. Just watch the show. Xiu # Question: Regarding the customized version of ChatGPT (CCTeams Investment Advisor) shared by the teacher, its knowledge cutoff date seems to be June of last year. Is the teacher using an updated version? Will the link change after the update? (Previously confused HXQ/HSQ). James\u0026rsquo; Response: Indeed, this AI is constantly being updated and trained. The link may change with updates. The latest link (showing content updated on April 26, such as 70/30 allocation recommendations) has been shared in the chat area. New links will be provided regularly (such as weekly or monthly) in the future. The teacher himself uses a more advanced personal \u0026ldquo;Super AI\u0026rdquo; account (possibly GPT-4o or higher, with memory function) to process and extract information, and then \u0026ldquo;feeds\u0026rdquo; the essence to this publicly shared GPTs version (similar to DIPS extraction). Feedback on AI answers is welcome for improvement. Yao # Sharing: Because of recent trade tensions, I re-listened to the 2022 recordings. Two points are profound: 1. The biggest risk is missing the market (leaving the market). 2. Focus on long-term returns, not short-term fluctuations/shocks. The market is full of contradictory information (repeated presidential statements, pessimistic commentators) and bad news, but it often rebounds unintentionally. Friends who wait for a clear trend (such as buying after the big trend comes back) miss the rise. No one can accurately time the market. It is extremely difficult to obtain stable and high returns in the long term (such as an annualized return of 10% or more), like the sustained performance of top athletes (such as playing ball for 20 years); it is easy to have a good shot occasionally, but difficult to be stable in the long term. It is essential to stay in the market for a long time and focus on long-term growth. James\u0026rsquo; Response: Strongly agree. Investing is like a long-distance race, continuing to stay in the front (such as 3rd or 4th place) will eventually win, because the leaders often make mistakes. This is how index funds are, not the best in a single year, but leading in the long term. Need an investment horizon of 15+ years. The key to persistence is having sufficient cash reserves (especially for retirees, it is recommended to have living expenses for 15+ years) or a continuous work income. Monmon # Sharing 1: Started following the teacher last year, investing on my own and encouraging elders (sold insurance and invested). Recently, I have experienced a market decline and am at peace, but the elders are experiencing large fluctuations for the first time (they adopted a Beta 1.2 allocation). Through repeatedly watching videos and communicating, the elders\u0026rsquo; confidence is still stable. Sharing 2: Selling a house has been tortuous: difficulty communicating with my husband (disagreed at first, had disputes), cold market (the central bank fought housing speculation in September, difficult to get loans), price reduction (applied the teacher\u0026rsquo;s concept of \u0026ldquo;there is no house that cannot be sold, only a price that cannot be sold\u0026rdquo;) to complete the sale (in February this year). The process was painful (communication, management, market changes, funds stuck, high taxes), and I learned a lesson that I don\u0026rsquo;t want to experience again. Sharing 3: Currently, half of the investment portfolio is QQQ-like, half is TSMC, and there is also a mortgage line of credit (financial mortgage). My husband wants to use this line of credit to increase positions when the market falls (TSMC?), but hesitates and is afraid in the middle of the actual fall (soft-handed, unable to do it). This decline allowed him to experience his true risk tolerance. My husband did not accept the full QQQ allocation before, but now he has some experience. It verifies the stability of the teacher\u0026rsquo;s asset allocation method. James\u0026rsquo; Response: Appreciate Monmon\u0026rsquo;s peaceful state of mind (a good quality for investors, \u0026ldquo;destiny\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;luck\u0026rdquo; to meet the teacher). Communicating with family requires patience (it is a 15-30 year undertaking, no rush). The funds from the financial mortgage should be invested as soon as possible (such as 00662), buy blindly, and don\u0026rsquo;t time the market. When investing, consider the overall asset allocation, include the loan amount in the total asset calculation, and ensure that the total Beta value is within the desired range (such as about 0.7, that is, maintaining an overall ratio of about 70/30), rather than investing all the borrowed money in high-risk assets. It is recommended to keep at least 30% cash (can be 4:1:5 or 5:1:4, Beta 0.6 or 0.7). This decline is a touchstone for risk tolerance, proving the necessity of conservative allocation. Even if young and have a job, 30% cash is also recommended. From Taiwan # Sharing: The situation is similar to Monmon\u0026rsquo;s. Both myself and the elders invested in 00662/00670L, using Beta 1.2 (4:4:2, that is, 40% 00662, 40% 00670L, 20% cash/00865B) allocation. I can bear the recent fluctuations (the government is quite amazing), but I am not sure whether the elders (who have not watched YouTube, have no financial common sense, but believe and invest) can bear greater future declines (such as 40-80%). Continuously accompany the elders and give them confidence. The elders have a good mentality so far. Question: If I want to reduce the Beta for the elders, when and how should I operate? James\u0026rsquo; Response: It is generally recommended now that the Beta should not exceed 1.0 (such as 70/30). For an existing allocation of 1.2, it is recommended to evaluate it at the end of each year: if the market rises (such as 00662 returning to the level at the beginning of the year or higher), you can sell part of the leveraged position (00670L) and transfer the funds to cash (00865B), so that the cash ratio is adjusted to 30% or higher. If the market is down at the end of the year, then do not move. The goal is to gradually reduce the Beta to below 1.0. Before that, there is no need to consider complicated rebalancing strategies. Don\u0026rsquo;t operate too frequently (once a year) to avoid increasing the elders\u0026rsquo; anxiety (they may secretly look at the APP). Lucy # Question 1: Investing in QQQ in Canada, the teacher recommends QQC, etc., and mentions avoiding Hedged funds? It seems that most Canadian versions are Hedged? Which one should I choose? (Previously confused HXQ/HSQ). James\u0026rsquo; Response: Recommend HXQ.t because it does not pay dividends, making tax treatment simpler. If you already hold QQC.to or ZQQ, there is no need to sell it, and new investments can be bought in HXQ.t. It is also acceptable if only Hedged versions are available locally. Question 2: Please explain the asset allocation ratio (such as 70/30, 4:4:2). Time is limited (working, back problems requiring exercise, blood sugar problems), it is difficult to find specific content in videos, and listening to Clubhouse is also time-consuming. James\u0026rsquo; Response: (Emphasizing the importance of learning, earning money from work only accounts for a small part of a lifetime of wealth, so you should spend time learning about investment) For ordinary investors working in Canada, the simplest allocation is: 70% HXQ.t + 30% cash/money market fund (Money Market). Check and adjust annually (sell the ones that have risen more to supplement cash, or use cash to buy the ones that have fallen more) to maintain this ratio. (Nibalao Supplement): Canadian local stock dividends have tax advantages, while US-sourced dividends (such as QQC) are taxed (I don\u0026rsquo;t know how much, but higher than Canadian stock taxes). I agree with the teacher\u0026rsquo;s point of view: focus on investment returns is higher than focusing on work. James\u0026rsquo; Response: Reiterating the advantage of HXQ.t not paying dividends. Canadian funds seem to be performing well, possibly because better compounding due to not paying dividends. Sharing (Follow-up): Listening to the teacher\u0026rsquo;s criticism is very comfortable and helpful. I am impatient, but after listening to the teacher\u0026rsquo;s patient answers to \u0026ldquo;stupid questions,\u0026rdquo; I am more patient in helping others. James\u0026rsquo; Response: Asking questions bravely is important. Jason # Sharing: Detailed comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin/cryptocurrencies and QQQ, based on his personal experience in the blockchain industry (entered the industry in 2017, experienced the blockchain/cryptocurrency community, ICO explosion, 2018 bear market): Storage Security: BTC requires self-management of private keys/hardware wallets (cold wallets), which are easy to lose or damage, high risk; QQQ is托管ed by brokers, which is safe. Transaction Security: BTC is vulnerable to hacker attacks, phishing, and platform crashes; QQQ is protected by regulations. Staking/Liquidity: BTC lacks standardized and safe staking channels (DeFi is high risk); QQQ can be easily staked and borrowed (pledged) through brokers without selling. Taxes: Selling BTC requires capital gains tax; holding QQQ for a long time and using pledges can avoid/defer taxes. Legality: BTC has legal risks in China (trading and mining are illegal), and cashing out may be frozen; QQQ (and QDII 513100/513300) are legal and compliant. Volatility/Risk: BTC is extremely volatile (short-term drops of 50-80% are common, such as an 85% drop in 2018), and ordinary people cannot withstand the mental stress; QQQ has a much lower frequency of large fluctuations. Liquidity: The actual circulating volume of BTC is limited (locked by large holders, lost coins), which is not as high as the global liquidity of QQQ. Practicality: Not detailed. Future Returns: BTC has a high market value (nearly 2 trillion US dollars, comparable to top technology companies), and the possibility of super high multiple growth in the future is reduced (even if it rises to 200,000 US dollars/coin, it is only 2-3 times), and the rate of return may tend to be stable, lower than QQQ. Conclusion: Cryptocurrencies are \u0026ldquo;demons and ghosts,\u0026rdquo; not suitable for ordinary investors, highly tempting but extremely risky. James\u0026rsquo; Comment: Completely agree, cryptocurrencies should not be touched. Shared cases of others losing huge amounts of Bitcoin (equivalent to 15 million US dollars) due to unfamiliarity with cross-chain transfer rules (such as transferring between different chains or exchanges that do not support the target chain), emphasizing its complexity and risk (may be a technical problem or fraud). Responding to Chat Room Questions # File Access: In areas with limited Google service, you can download the files and open them with local software (such as Excel). 00864B Taxes: According to Angela\u0026rsquo;s feedback, it is overseas income, which is tax-free if it is less than 1 million Taiwan dollars (or other high limit such as 7.5 million) per year, and is exempt from the second-generation supplementary health insurance premium. The main problem becomes the trouble of manual reinvestment. You need a principal of 25 million to possibly exceed 1 million in interest. AI Link: Confirmed that the latest link has been provided. Buying QQQ in China: Through QDII funds, such as 513100, 513300. See page 10 of the lecture notes. Conflicting Ideas Between Spouses: Patience, use your own controllable funds to set an example. Sometimes even if you prove it, the other person does not recognize it (\u0026ldquo;past performance does not represent the future\u0026rdquo;), it depends on fate (destiny). Technical Analysis/Prediction: The teacher does not make predictions (when will it bottom out, will there be a recession or crash). Robert Kiyosaki: The teacher is critical of him (\u0026ldquo;he will go bankrupt\u0026rdquo;). Trump Policy: No need to pay attention, high uncertainty, just \u0026ldquo;drizzle,\u0026rdquo; impossible to have zero income tax. In the long run, US taxes may increase to deal with the deficit. Do not make decisions based on unconfirmed conclusions. Mean Reversion: There is no simple mean reversion in the stock market. The growth of high-tech companies (such as TSMC) will not revert to traditional industries (such as China Steel, Formosa Plastics). Those who think it will revert are \u0026ldquo;bookworms.\u0026rdquo; Value stocks (such as Starbucks, McDonald\u0026rsquo;s) also perform differently. 442 Allocation: Not recommended for office workers, it is too risky. Those who have already used it should handle it according to the MM case. Investment vs Speculation: The teacher does not agree with the statement that \u0026ldquo;all investments are speculation.\u0026rdquo; 12-Year Certificates of Deposit vs Compounding: 00865B/VOO etc. are compounded. AI Asset Allocation Advice: May be \u0026ldquo;incorrect\u0026rdquo; due to questioning methods or AI model understanding deviations. IV. Highlights # The market is always fluctuating, the constant in the market is fluctuation, so fluctuation is certain to happen in the market, so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to analyze where the fluctuation comes from\u0026hellip; You see everyone talking so eloquently, in fact, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t even know what he is talking about\u0026hellip; \u0026ndash; James\nContext: James emphasized the normality and unpredictability of market fluctuations, advising investors not to waste time analyzing the causes of short-term fluctuations.\nInvestment is buying with the intention of never selling, this is investment. Buying with the intention of selling at a high point is called speculation. \u0026ndash; James\nContext: James clearly distinguished the core criteria of investment and speculation: whether the purpose is to hold for the long term.\nMaking a decision about all investment and financial life is very simple, which is long-term, simple and effective\u0026hellip; Convenience is a value. No trouble is a value. \u0026ndash; James\nContext: When comparing 00864B and 00865B, James emphasized that choosing an investment method that is simpler and less troublesome in the long run has value in itself.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to risk the money you need for the money you don\u0026rsquo;t need. \u0026ndash; James (quoting/paraphrasing Buffett\u0026rsquo;s idea)\nContext: Explained why even if it is judged that the market may rise, you should keep enough cash buffer (the money you need) and should not take too much risk for additional, potentially unnecessary returns (the money you don\u0026rsquo;t need).\nLater you will find that when humans develop to the extreme, food, clothing, housing, and transportation are all free, all free\u0026hellip; Then what does it mean to be alive?\u0026hellip; But what is the meaning of a dog? This may be the question that the last 80% of people have to think about. \u0026ndash; James\nContext: When fantasizing about the future when AI is extremely developed, James raised the question of the profound crisis of existential meaning that humans (especially the majority who do not need to work) will face after material needs are completely satisfied.\nThe biggest risk comes from [missing] the market\u0026hellip; Focus on long-term returns, not this short-term [fluctuation]. \u0026ndash; Yao\nContext: Sharing the profound experience after reviewing the teacher\u0026rsquo;s teachings when the market information is chaotic, emphasizing the importance of being in the market for a long time and focusing on long-term goals.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t want to be the first every time, we only want to be the third or fourth every time\u0026hellip; Over the long term, we will be the first. \u0026ndash; James\nContext: Using the analogy of racing to explain the logic of index investing: not pursuing short-term leadership, relying on continuous and steady performance, and ultimately winning in the long cycle.\nThere is no house that cannot be sold, only a price that cannot be sold. \u0026ndash; Monmon\nContext: Sharing the experience of selling a house, mentioning that applying this point of view ultimately successfully sold the property.\nYou should put your focus on investing, and the return is definitely much higher than if you put your focus on working. \u0026ndash; Nibalao\nContext: When discussing that students do not have time to learn about investment, this student emphasized that based on their own experience, the long-term return of putting energy into investment learning far exceeds that of putting it into work itself.\n[Cryptocurrencies] are one of the demons and ghosts\u0026hellip; The future return of Bitcoin may tend to be stable, and the teacher also mentioned this issue before. \u0026ndash; Jason\nContext: Based on industry experience and risk analysis, the student qualified cryptocurrencies as a high-risk category unsuitable for ordinary investors, and pointed out that its future return may not be as good as index funds.\nV. Summary # This Clubhouse episode was rich and insightful, ranging from the macro market philosophy (fluctuation is normal, long-term perspective, optimistic mentality), AI\u0026rsquo;s disruptive vision of the future (productivity, social structure, meaning of life), to the micro investment practice (ETF selection such as 00865B vs 00864B, Canadian HXQ.t, asset allocation principles such as 70/30, Beta management, risk awareness), all detailed explanations and discussions were provided. The core information is still focused on: adhering to long-term holding of high-quality index funds (especially the Nasdaq 100), understanding and accepting market fluctuations, maintaining rationality and patience, using time compounding, and conducting sound asset allocation according to personal risk tolerance (emphasizing the importance of at least 30% cash), and being vigilant about market noise and high-risk speculative products (such as cryptocurrencies). The Q\u0026amp;A session answered in detail the specific questions encountered by students in different countries, different stages, and different product selections, and emphasized the importance of continuous learning of investment knowledge. Finally, it was reminded again that the Clubhouse will be suspended for the next two weeks.\nDisclaimer: This article is only a personal learning note and does not constitute any investment advice.

Current Theme # This episode focuses on the mindset and strategies that investors should adopt in the context of current market volatility and volatile international situations. James emphasizes that for long-term investors, short-term market fluctuations, macroeconomic conditions, and even wars should not be of excessive concern. The core strategy should be to insist on buying high-quality index funds (such as Nasdaq 100 QQQ) and holding them for the long term, never selling. At the same time, he shares an updated Excel financial simulation tool, discusses pre-retirement withdrawal strategies, leverage management, the significant advantages of early Roth conversion, and how to build a strong investment psychology to cope with external pressure and complex information.\nII. Briefing Content # Core Investment Philosophy and Market Views # Ignore the Noise, Keep Buying: Macro factors such as market volatility, international situations, tariff wars, trade wars, hot wars, and cold wars have little to do with long-term investing. Investors cannot and do not need to predict or respond to them. Just keep buying index funds (QQQ) and holding them for the long term. Halving is Inevitable: In the long-term investment process, a 50% or even greater reduction in assets is an inevitable event, not a matter of probability, but a certainty. Investors need to be psychologically prepared and ensure that they can still \u0026ldquo;survive\u0026rdquo; in this situation. Ask yourself every day: \u0026ldquo;If the market halves again, can I still hold on?\u0026rdquo; Long-Termism and Optimistic Mindset: Investing requires patience, and wealth is worth waiting for. The market always goes up in the long run. Investors should always be extremely optimistic, even if the market drops 80%, because the decline is part of the investment process, and the future is always bright. Buying is for future gains, not for leaving the market out of fear of future declines. Excel Tool Updates and Applications (Refer to Lecture Notes from Page 18) # Origin and Background of the Problem: Some students reported problems with the old Excel version: 1) Increasing the spending ratio may actually reduce the final assets; 2) After a significant increase in assets (such as from 1 million to 4 million), spending directly at 2% of the new assets (i.e., 80,000) failed the stress test when simulating the 2000 tech bubble burst. Main Updates and Usage Suggestions: Separating Spending and Rebalancing Ratios: Corrected the error of linking the spending ratio with the smart rebalancing ratio. The new version allows independent settings. It is recommended that the smart rebalancing ratio remain at 2% or be adjusted according to individual risk tolerance. New Strategy for Increasing Spending After Asset Growth (0.8% Rule): Simulation Conclusion: If assets increase significantly (such as from 1 million to 4.6 million, net worth 3.8 million, and borrowing 780,000 accounting for 17% of total assets), spending directly at 2% of the new assets (80,000/year) is too risky. Safety Recommendation: When assets have increased by more than 2.5 times and the pledged loan ratio is controlled within 20%, consider increasing the annual spending to 0.7% or 0.8% of the new total assets. For example, assets of 4.6 million can spend about 36,800/year (4.6 million * 0.8%). After this adjustment, even if you encounter a market shock similar to 2000, you can maintain a sufficient margin of safety. This means that if assets grow 2.5 times, the annual spending can safely increase by about 2.2 times. Operation Guide (Using the \u0026ldquo;Practice Version\u0026rdquo; Excel): Enter \u0026ldquo;Scenario Nine\u0026rdquo; (applicable to situations where you have started pledged borrowing and spending). Modify the \u0026ldquo;Amount Already Borrowed\u0026rdquo; in the \u0026ldquo;Personal Information\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Scenario Eight Nine Information\u0026rdquo; area in the front of the table (do not directly change the S2 cell inside Excel, go to the overview page in front to change it). Return to the scenario nine simulation page and modify the initial asset allocation ratio (such as QQQ 33%, QLD/Leverage 45%, Cash 22%). Adjust the \u0026ldquo;Borrowing Expenses\u0026rdquo; percentage (located in column T, such as changing to 0.8 or 0.7). Adjust the \u0026ldquo;Borrowing Interest\u0026rdquo; according to the actual situation (cell S5, such as setting it to 3% for Taiwan). Observe the \u0026ldquo;Minimum Maintenance Rate\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;Minimum Equity Ratio\u0026rdquo;) in the results and ensure that it is higher than your set safety threshold (such as 150% or 160%). Cash Interest Assumption: When calculating the compound interest on the Cash portion in Excel, the interest rate used is half of the borrowing rate (S5) (i.e., S5/2/12 calculated monthly). This is based on the conservative assumption that the deposit rate is usually lower than the borrowing rate and does not need to be modified. Version Description: Provides \u0026ldquo;Easy Version\u0026rdquo; (only needs to fill in the initial total assets, smart rebalancing %, and annual spending %) and \u0026ldquo;Practice Version\u0026rdquo; (allows you to modify more detailed parameters inside Excel, such as initial allocation ratio, profit transfer ratio, initial borrowing ratio/amount, withholding cash ratio, etc.). To perform detailed simulations and parameter adjustments, you need to use the \u0026ldquo;Practice Version.\u0026rdquo; Early Retirement and Roth Conversion (Refer to Lecture Notes on Page 20) # Scenario Analysis: Compare a couple aged 50 with 2 million in Traditional IRA, expected return of 14%, and tax rate of 24%, under three different Roth conversion strategies for the long term (to age 100). Scenario 1: No conversion, relying on RMD. The final assets are approximately 330 million. Scenario 2: Work until age 56 and then start converting. The final assets are approximately 350 million. Scenario 3: Retire immediately at age 50 and start converting. The final assets are as high as 780 million. Core Conclusion: Retiring 6 years early to perform Roth conversion, utilizing the low tax bracket window in the early stage of retirement, can bring more than 300 million USD in additional wealth. Even for high-income earners (assuming a conversion tax rate of 40%), it takes an additional 9-10 years of work to make up for the huge opportunity cost of not converting early. It is strongly recommended that those who meet the conditions plan and execute Roth conversion as soon as possible. Financial System Operation and Personal Financial Wisdom # Make Good Use of Financial Tools (Transmissive Power): Specifically pointed out that Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s low interest rate environment provides investors with favorable conditions to use borrowing (pledged loans, etc.) to amplify investment returns (transmissive power). Bank Perspective and Customer Relationships: Banks view deposits as liabilities and loans as assets. They are happy to see customers borrow and pay interest on time. Large borrowing customers are VIPs of the bank and enjoy preferential treatment; ordinary depositors need to go through regular procedures. Wealth Circulation Mechanism: Commercial banks play an intermediary role in the capitalist system, transferring the idle funds (deposits) of risk-averse/non-investors to investors (borrowers) who are willing to take risks and know how to use funds, and earn interest spreads from them. Understanding this mechanism helps investors use leverage more confidently. Investment Psychological Construction and Philosophy of Life # Coping with External Pressure: When facing the worries or doubts of family and friends when the market falls, you need to build a strong inner self: Self-Belief: First of all, you must be firm in your investment philosophy and understand that volatility is a normal process. Shielding and Transcendence: Practice from the realm of \u0026ldquo;not listening, not seeing, does not exist\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;both seeing and listening but also does not exist,\u0026rdquo; that is, the inner self is not disturbed by external words. Positive Attitude: Show confidence and a good state to the outside world (\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fine, no problem, the market will rise\u0026rdquo;). Decluttering and Value Ordering (Refer to Video 00351 \u0026ldquo;Enlightenment\u0026rdquo;): Life should be simplified, and clarifying what you \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t want\u0026rdquo; is more important than what you \u0026ldquo;want.\u0026rdquo; Reducing unnecessary material pursuits and social relationships can bring more freedom and focus. Reflect on the core values of life, such as \u0026ldquo;relationships,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;sense of contribution,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;health,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;soul\u0026rdquo; shared by students, and work is only a part of it. Get rid of the shackles of seeking external recognition (refer to \u0026ldquo;The Courage to be Disliked\u0026rdquo;). Love and responsibility for children are the fundamental values that many people find difficult to give up. Beware of Information Cocoons (Refer to Video 00420 Logic Class): Realize that we may all be trapped in \u0026ldquo;information cocoons\u0026rdquo; by network algorithms, only accessing homogeneous information, resulting in a narrow vision and loss of independent thinking ability, like \u0026ldquo;parrots\u0026rdquo; repeating views. Actively seek different information sources, use critical thinking, especially the ability to falsify, and maintain skepticism about the information received (first assume that 99% is wrong). III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Lily # Share: Taiwanese firefighter, 40 years old, new investor (started in February), adopting a 442 allocation (40% QQQ, 40% leverage, 20% cash), investing approximately 6 million. Recently experienced a large single-day drop of 28% in the leveraged portion, but stated that they could withstand it. Few friends shared the same philosophy. Believes that never selling can achieve financial freedom. James\u0026rsquo;s Comments: Thank you for sharing. The 442 allocation is more aggressive, and this decline is a good stress test. Reminded that firefighting work is physically demanding, and investment should focus more on stability. Suggested adjusting the allocation according to their own comfort level, such as 433 or more conservative 424 or even 505. The primary goal of asset allocation is to make yourself \u0026ldquo;comfortable\u0026rdquo; and able to hold it for the long term. Cash is the key to \u0026ldquo;surviving.\u0026rdquo; When facing external doubts, maintaining a strong inner self and confidence is the most important. Rui # Share: Life Reflections: Reviewing last week\u0026rsquo;s homework, combined with \u0026ldquo;How Will You Measure Your Life?\u0026rdquo; and Brian Dyson\u0026rsquo;s five-ball theory, clarified that the second value of life is \u0026ldquo;relationships,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;sense of contribution,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;treating nature well\u0026rdquo;; emphasized the irreplaceability of health, family, friendship, and soul; the current most wanted to get rid of is \u0026ldquo;seeking recognition from others\u0026rdquo;; believed that life regrets often stem from \u0026ldquo;things not done.\u0026rdquo; Origin of Excel Questions: Deeply studied Excel and discovered problems due to concerns about smart rebalancing causing Beta to continue to rise (such as \u0026gt;1.2) and wanting to increase living expenses (at 2% of new assets) after asset growth. Question: Can leveraged ETFs (such as 00670L) commonly used by Taiwanese investors be included in the Excel model to calculate the maintenance rate (market value)? If included, even with a higher Beta (such as 1.24), it seems that a 433 allocation can pass the test. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Philosophy of Life: Appreciated the in-depth thinking. Emphasized the importance of \u0026ldquo;decluttering\u0026rdquo; and clarifying \u0026ldquo;what not to want.\u0026rdquo; Agreed that there is no need for others to recognize, and shared that they value their relationship with their children the most. Recommended video 00351 \u0026ldquo;Enlightenment.\u0026rdquo; Excel and Taiwan Applications: Theoretically, the market value of leveraged ETFs can be included in the maintenance rate calculation. The existing model is based on the US situation and is conservative (high interest rate assumptions, not explicitly including the market value of leverage), aimed at being universal and safe. Taiwanese investors can take advantage of the no capital gains tax (easy to reduce leverage) and lower interest rates, and modify Excel themselves (such as changing the interest rate and adjusting the maintenance rate formula) to better fit reality. If the model can pass, it is usually easier in Taiwan. Thanked them for their question, which prompted the optimization of the \u0026ldquo;how to increase spending after asset growth\u0026rdquo; strategy (0.7%-0.8% rule or reducing leverage). Yaowen # Question: Observed that the recovery time of historical bear markets seems to be shortening. Combined with the evolution of US financial policies (QE, pandemic response, etc.), does it mean that the government\u0026rsquo;s control efficiency has improved and the market recovery is accelerating? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Agreed with the observation. With the accumulation of financial theory and practical experience, policy tools are more effective, and the ability to respond to known crises has indeed increased, shortening the recovery period. But the real risk lies in unknown, unprecedented crises. There is no need to worry too much about known patterns, and be optimistic about the future but have risk awareness. Weijun # Share: 433 allocation is already All in. Although they thought they were prepared, when actually facing the decline, it was difficult to bear the pressure from their parents\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;caring\u0026rdquo; worries, and they were even afraid to tell them about the losses. Glad that this decline occurred when the invested proportion was not yet high. Question: How to cope with this kind of caring pressure from relatives and friends (especially parents)? (Especially for office workers who cannot physically avoid it like retirees). James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Cannot control others, only cultivate the inner self. From shielding information (\u0026ldquo;not listening, not seeing, does not exist\u0026rdquo;) to the inner self not being disturbed (\u0026ldquo;both seeing and listening but also does not exist\u0026rdquo;). The key is to have firm self-belief, understand the current situation, and show confidence to the outside world (\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fine\u0026rdquo;). The decline is the norm for investing, or a good opportunity to rebalance. When the inner self is strong enough to realize a certain illusion of the external world, its influence can be reduced. JJ # Question: Expressed concerns about the US\u0026rsquo;s leading position in technology, listed multiple negative information (loss of scientists, tightening of visas, damage to funding/independence of research institutions, anti-vaccine stance of the Minister of Health and public health incidents), and asked about the impact of the US losing its position as a technology center on QQQ investment and whether it is necessary to adjust the strategy. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Macro Level: Refer to video 00430C. Admitted that global competition is intensifying, but the US has not declined, and the foundation of technological strength remains. The US democratic system has resilience and self-correcting ability, and there is no need to be overly pessimistic due to short-term policies or personnel changes. Investment Indicators: The criteria for judgment is the composition of the top ten technology companies in the world by market value. If it is still dominated by the United States, then there is no need to change the strategy. If the future pattern changes significantly (such as non-US companies accounting for more than half), consider adjusting the proportion accordingly. Unlikely to happen within 50 years. Specific Concerns: Much information may be amplified or biased (information cocoon effect). Believe in the basic integrity system and institutional resilience of American society. Individual incidents (such as anti-vaccine rhetoric, measles outbreaks), while worrying, are unlikely to subvert the entire system. Stay focused, but don\u0026rsquo;t panic, and focus on verifiable facts. David # Share and Response: Questioned the information mentioned by JJ, emphasizing the need to verify the source and scientific nature of the information (such as the measles vaccine issue), and compared the different practices of China and the United States in areas such as autonomous driving, pointing out the prudence and regulatory constraints in the US system. Questioned the authenticity of reports about cuts in social welfare (lack of examples). Cited historical data from the 2018 trade war to prove that the US market and economic regulation are more resilient than China. Suggested actively searching for reverse information and historical data to overcome fear. James\u0026rsquo;s Comments: Highly praised David\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on information discrimination. Further elaborated on the dangers of information cocoons, which deprive people of independent thinking ability and turn them into parrots. Called on everyone to be vigilant, actively break down information barriers, and use critical thinking and falsification methods (refer to video 00420 Logic Class) to examine information. Tony # Question: Why is the annual borrowing rate (S5) divided by 2 in the monthly compound interest calculation of the cash portion in the Excel practice version? James/慶 (Qing) Response: This is the design assumption of the model: The deposit rate (cash yield) is set to half of the borrowing rate. This is a simplified, conservative estimate that reflects the reality of the bank\u0026rsquo;s deposit and loan interest rate spread. The formula principal * (1 + S5/2/12) is correct, reflecting this safety margin, and does not need to be modified. IV. Wonderful Views # Market volatility, international situations, trade wars, hot and cold wars\u0026hellip; have nothing to do with our investment, just buy, don\u0026rsquo;t sell. Long-term is investment. \u0026ndash; James\nBackground: Emphasizes that long-term investment should focus on holding high-quality assets, ignoring short-term market noise and macro events.\nYou will definitely encounter several opportunities for asset depreciation of 50% in the market, this is not a probability problem, this is a certainty. \u0026ndash; James\nBackground: Reminds investors that a significant market correction is an inevitable part of long-term investment and that they need to be psychologically and financially prepared for it.\nAsset allocation is not done for performance, asset allocation is done for your comfort. \u0026ndash; James\nBackground: Explains that the primary goal of asset allocation (especially the proportion of cash holdings) is to ensure that investors can hold it with peace of mind and get through the cycle, rather than simply pursuing the highest returns.\nCommercial banks are intermediaries that transfer the money of the poor to the rich for use, and this revolving door takes place in banks. This is the reason why the capitalist system makes the poor poorer and the rich richer. \u0026ndash; James\nBackground: Reveals the core role of the modern banking system in capital flow and its impact on the wealth distribution pattern.\nPeople who borrow money are VIPs\u0026hellip; those who don\u0026rsquo;t have much money and don\u0026rsquo;t borrow money, please go to the counter to draw a number and line up. \u0026ndash; James (quoting student Benson\u0026rsquo;s observation)\nBackground: Vividly compares the vast difference in the way banks treat large borrowing customers and ordinary depositors.\nYou push out all the things you don\u0026rsquo;t want first\u0026hellip; then what are the things you have left that you want? It\u0026rsquo;s very little\u0026hellip; the less you want, the less homework you have. \u0026ndash; James\nBackground: Applies the concept of \u0026ldquo;decluttering\u0026rdquo; to life planning, advocating that by reducing desires and unnecessary pursuits, inner freedom and focus can be achieved.\nWe are besieged by the network and locked in an information prison, you can\u0026rsquo;t break out\u0026hellip; all our thoughts are not our thoughts\u0026hellip; we are all parrots. \u0026ndash; James\nBackground: Deeply warns of the erosion of individual cognition and independent thinking ability by \u0026ldquo;information cocoons,\u0026rdquo; calling for vigilance.\nBoth seeing and listening but also does not exist. \u0026ndash; James\nBackground: Describes an advanced state of psychological practice, where even when exposed to negative or disturbing information, the inner self can remain calm and unaffected.\nThings that have happened in the past are less worried about, we are worried about things that have never happened before. \u0026ndash; James\nBackground: Distinguishes between known and unknown risks, pointing out that historical experience helps to deal with recurring crises, but the real challenge lies in dealing with new, unknown shocks.\nIf you retire six years early (to perform Roth conversion), you will be short of 300 million (USD). \u0026ndash; James\nBackground: Based on simulation calculation results, strongly emphasizes the huge long-term wealth effect that can be brought about by using the low tax rate window to convert Roth IRA/401k as early as possible.\nV. Summary # This lecture, against the background of increased market volatility, strengthened the core concept of long-term investment: ignore the noise and insist on holding high-quality index funds (QQQ). James not only updated and explained in detail the important financial planning tool Excel model (especially the adjustment of withdrawal strategies after asset growth), but also persuasively demonstrated the amazing value of doing Roth conversion as early as possible. At a deeper level, the course focused on the construction of investment psychology, discussed how to understand and use financial system rules, how to cope with external pressure (worries from relatives and friends, social information) with a strong inner self, and especially emphasized the extreme importance of maintaining independent thinking and being wary of \u0026ldquo;information cocoons\u0026rdquo; in the era of information explosion. The ultimate goal is to help investors cultivate both their inner skills and achieve a double improvement in cognition and mindset on the road to pursuing financial freedom.\nDisclaimer: This article is only a personal study note and does not constitute any investment advice.

Current Theme # The core viewpoint of this episode emphasizes that investment decisions should be independent of market volatility, with sufficient cash reserves serving as the first step and cornerstone of investment planning. After determining the cash level based on individual risk tolerance and living needs, then proceed with long-term (15+ years) investment in index funds (especially the Nasdaq 100). Beta is a result of asset allocation, not the starting point. At the same time, be wary of various risks in investment, especially cognitive risks and behavioral biases, and remain vigilant about conflicts of interest in financial services.\nII. Briefing Content # Market Volatility and Long-Term Perspective # Market fluctuations are normal. Having experienced multiple major crashes (2000, 2008, 2020, 2022), the current volatility is relatively mild. In the long run, most of the current concerns will \u0026ldquo;leave no trace.\u0026rdquo; Don\u0026rsquo;t panic over short-term events. Time is the best medicine, but people are prone to repeating mistakes (old habits die hard). Investing is a long-term matter (15+ years), and dips are buying opportunities. James has been investing for 40 years and has never \u0026ldquo;seen\u0026rdquo; a market crash, only buying opportunities. Core Investment Principles # Focus on Doing the Right Things: The core is \u0026ldquo;Han Xin Counts Soldiers\u0026rdquo; (i.e., using affordable and safe borrowing, such as mortgages and credit lines, for investment), putting borrowed money into the market, but with sufficient cash reserves. Investment Targets: Only invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (such as QQQ, 00662, 513100, etc.), as it represents human growth and innovation and has a self-evolving mechanism of survival of the fittest. Related materials are linked on page 10 of the handout. It is mentioned that HXQ and other Nasdaq 100-based funds may outperform QQQ in certain periods. Long-Term Holding: Holding for 15+ years after purchase is key, \u0026ldquo;never selling.\u0026rdquo; Only inaction can lead to wealth, not frequent trading. Stay Optimistic: Investment is based on confidence in the long-term development of humanity. Independent Learning: Investment requires self-study, understanding the reasons behind the strategy and the then-current market environment, and not blindly following. Asset Allocation: Cash First # Primary Question: The first step in investing is not what to buy, but how much cash needs to be retained to live securely and cope with emergencies. This is the most important thing. Cash Needs Determine Allocation: Young People: First, prepare an emergency fund (e.g., NT$400,000/CNY100,000), and only invest surplus funds. Asset Allocation Model Examples: 433 (Beta 1.0): 40% Index + 30% Leverage + 30% Cash. Requires 30% Cash \u0026gt; Emergency Fund (e.g., NT$400,000), requiring total assets of NT$1.33 million to implement. 424 (Beta 0.8): 40% Index + 20% Leverage + 40% Cash. Requires 40% Cash \u0026gt; Emergency Fund (e.g., NT$400,000), requiring total assets of NT$1 million to implement. Illustrates that reducing Beta can lower the funding threshold. High-Net-Worth Individuals: The principle is the same, determine the cash ratio according to personal comfort (potentially millions of RMB or hundreds of thousands of USD). Beta is the Result, Not the Goal: First determine cash needs and risk tolerance, naturally forming the allocation ratio, and finally calculate the Beta value as a measurement tool. Don\u0026rsquo;t set a target Beta from the beginning. Allocation Irrelevant Factors: Asset allocation is unrelated to age, fund size, or market level, only related to how to prevent accidents and how much accident can be tolerated. Risk Management and Cognition # Risk Tolerance: Young people have less experience, so risk tolerance may not be high, and should not blindly pursue high Beta (e.g., 442). Wealthy people are usually more conservative, pursuing stability rather than extreme returns (Beta 0.5 may be sufficient). Conclusion: Taking risks beyond your tolerance is foolish. Investment is like eating spicy food, do what you can handle. Recommendation: Start conservatively. If you believe you can tolerate Beta 1.2, start with 1.0; if you believe you can tolerate 1.0, start with 0.8. Leveraged Fund Usage Principles: The ratio of leveraged funds should not exceed the ratio of cash or the ratio of the original fund. This suggests that a 442 allocation (40% Index + 40% Leverage + 20% Cash) is not suitable for most people. Behavioral Biases: Retail investors often feel sad when the market falls (regret buying early) and also sad when the market rises (regret not going all-in). The correct allocation should achieve \u0026ldquo;happy when it rises, comfortable when it falls,\u0026rdquo; maintaining \u0026ldquo;immovability.\u0026rdquo; Individual Stock Risk: No company lasts forever (examples: Intel, Kodak, Blackberry), individual stock risk is high. Index funds mitigate individual stock risk through a mechanism of survival of the fittest. Borrowing Risk: Safe Borrowing: Mortgages, credit lines (Han Xin Counts Soldiers), assuming income can cover monthly payments, unrelated to market fluctuations. Dangerous Borrowing: Margin trading, stock-pledged reinvestment. Market declines can lead to forced liquidation or even bankruptcy. These operations are strictly prohibited. James\u0026rsquo;s pledge loan: Based on holding cash far exceeding debt, ensuring absolute security. Specific Funds Use Risk: Money earmarked for short-term use (e.g., down payment on a house) within a short period (e.g., 3 years) absolutely cannot be invested in the stock market. Someone recently defaulted because of this. Tax Risk: Tax planning is very important and can affect significant wealth. Rules need to be carefully studied (e.g., the application of the U.S. Wash Sale Rule across accounts). Spending Ability Mindset: True \u0026ldquo;affordability\u0026rdquo; means being able to easily repurchase an item if it breaks down, as in James\u0026rsquo;s example of replacing a juicer. Large expenditures (e.g., buying a house) should also have this mindset, otherwise the risk is too high. Be Wary of Paid Services and Conflicts of Interest # Firmly Do Not Charge: James emphasizes that his services are free because charging easily creates conflicts of interest. His YouTube channel also does not have monetization enabled. Warning Signals: Be highly vigilant about any paid groups, paid recommendations, or financial services that charge commissions or kickbacks (e.g., account opening, buying funds). Mentions feedback that some groups may be transferring benefits through financial service referrals. Harm of Conflicts of Interest: Those who charge may recommend unsuitable or even harmful products/strategies for commissions. Self-Protection: Learn independently, compare multiple sources, understand financial products yourself, and do not easily trust introductions. Be especially wary of \u0026ldquo;pits\u0026rdquo; introduced by acquaintances. U.S. Regulations: The U.S. prohibits paying commissions to referrers for financial product recommendations (account opening rewards are usually given to the account opener themselves) to prevent conflicts of interest. Regulations may vary in other regions. Other Suggestions # Emergency Fund: Do not use the emergency fund to buy the dip. Survival is the most important thing. Regular Investment: Buy index funds immediately with new income (e.g., salary). Financial Literacy: Financial intelligence requires learning, there are no shortcuts. Be wary of the \u0026ldquo;get rich quick\u0026rdquo; mentality. Discuss with his daughter the mindset of speculators: it may be \u0026ldquo;greed,\u0026rdquo; it may be \u0026ldquo;poverty,\u0026rdquo; or it may be \u0026ldquo;not wanting to get rich slowly.\u0026rdquo; Video Viewing: New friends are advised to watch video #451, then start from #398 (January 2023) and watch in order. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # CAD # Sharing: Observed that regardless of wealth, some people are keen on short-term trading, possibly due to addictive pleasure or a sense of accomplishment. Poor people may say they need quick returns, while rich people may enjoy the process. Emphasized the strict prohibition of margin trading or stock-pledged reinvestment. Recently, with the market decline, someone was forced to liquidate and even became indebted because of it. Compared this to his own use of credit lines/mortgages for investment, stating that as long as he can afford the monthly payments, the market decline does not affect his survival. Mentioned a senior who was forced to liquidate due to margin calls during the Kuo Wan-Jung incident (Taiwan stock market historical event) and has been in debt ever since, warning future generations. Important Reminder: When observing an investment portfolio, you should pay attention to the fluctuation range of the overall assets rather than just staring at the leveraged portion with the biggest decline, which helps manage emotions. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Agreed. Explained the risk of illiquidity under the Taiwan stock market\u0026rsquo;s limit-down mechanism, compared to the U.S. market. Re-emphasized the danger of margin/pledge reinvestment. Explained that while he uses pledge loans, he holds cash far exceeding his debt to ensure security. Criticized putting house-buying money into the stock market as ignoring risk. BG # Sharing: Agreed that money management (cash ratio, position control) takes precedence over buying and selling signals. Money management should start from oneself (capital amount, risk tolerance willingness). Backtesting is not just to verify signals, but also to understand the money drawdown of the strategy under historical market conditions, to adjust positions to suit one\u0026rsquo;s own tolerance. Under the buy-and-hold strategy, investment funds must be strictly separated from living funds to avoid affecting long-term investment plans and mentality due to living needs. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Distinguished between strategy (long-term goals, cash planning, asset class allocation) and tactics (specific buying and selling points, short-term adjustments). Emphasized that tactics should not interfere with strategy, for example, one should not liquidate due to market panic or use the emergency fund to buy the dip. Rui # Sharing: Thanked James for solving many investment confusions (cash first, the use of leverage, asset allocation, etc.) through learning videos. Adopted the teacher\u0026rsquo;s advice and used 2% of his assets (through pledging) to pay for the Tesla purchase. After adopting the 433 allocation, he felt excited when the market fell, in contrast to the panic of his colleagues. Used a brokerage account (transfer from Yuantai Securities) that does not show the cost price, which helped reduce anxiety. Questions: Has reached the retirement goal (50x annual expenses), but his current salary is equivalent to 6% of total assets. He hopes for a higher retirement replacement rate in the future (assets need to increase by another 2-3 times). Between 433 (30% cash + 2% withdrawal) and 442 (20% cash + no withdrawal), how to further think about the choice from the perspective of safety and applicability? (Implicit question) Should he continue working for a sense of accomplishment, or retire early? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Regarding Purchasing the Car: Praised his use of \u0026ldquo;non-own funds\u0026rdquo; for consumption, pointing out that being able to borrow money is itself a manifestation of wealth, the key is controllable risk (sufficient cash). Regarding Retirement Choices: This is a classic question. Cited another case to illustrate that early retirement may bring huge benefits due to tax planning (such as Roth conversions). Suggested that Rui reflect: if work had no salary or recognition, would he still want to go? The value of work may change with stage, and there may be new pursuits in the future. Looking back from age 90, would he regret working several more decades? With financial freedom, the work mentality can be more relaxed. Regarding 433 vs 442 Safety: Assuming the market goes to zero, which is safer? The answer is the one with a higher cash ratio (433 has 30% cash, 442 has only 20%). Kai Xin # Question: Regarding whether the interest on the U.S. Pledged Asset Line (PAL, pledge loan) can be tax-deductible, and how to operate? Feels that the rules are complex and there are many restrictions. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The money borrowed from PAL is mainly used for consumption, not reinvestment. The issue of interest tax deduction is complicated and may require adjusting the type of capital gains (e.g., converting long-term to short-term), relying on accountant operations. James himself does not pay attention to this operation because his strategy is to hold a lot of cash, making interest income far exceed PAL interest expenses, and PAL interest is close to zero. The more fundamental strategy is to achieve \u0026ldquo;zero income, zero capital gains,\u0026rdquo; so there is no need to consider tax deduction. Derek # Sharing: Thanks to James and the community (Chen Feng, Sister K, etc.). Recently joined, the teacher\u0026rsquo;s reply and teaching made him have the courage to operate according to the plan when the market fell, and deeply realized the importance of risk control. Listening to the teacher\u0026rsquo;s videos can bring a sense of stability. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: This is precisely the reason why he insists on teaching, knowing that it is difficult to succeed in investing alone, and guidance and companionship are needed. Nai Xi # Sharing: As the founding moderator of the Taiwan 00662 community, thanks to James\u0026rsquo;s inspiration three years ago for changing his life. Thanks to all 19 administrators of the community (mentioning the rotation system, member contributions such as Chen Feng bringing it to a new height, Chris developing tools, etc.) for their hard work. Reiterated that he was inspired by the teacher\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;eliminate poverty\u0026rdquo; mission and hopes to help more people through the community. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Recalled the meeting with Nai Xi and the community backbone (eighteen arhats), praised their quality and Nai Xi\u0026rsquo;s persistence and humility. Affirmed the value and operation of the 00662 community and regretted that it was limited by the LINE platform and could not cover the world. Ming Yu # Sharing: No questions or sharing. Yao # Sharing: Mentioned recent rumors about Trump\u0026rsquo;s friends profiting from trade war news, and extended thoughts about the relationship between the morality of politicians and social progress. Lamented that moral constraints are limited, but human technology is still developing. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Agreed that the world is full of unknowns (quoting Buffett), and the market always has surprises (epidemic circuit breakers, drastic trade war fluctuations). Need to remain humble and prepare for extreme risks (such as market closure/continuous decline for 10-15 years). Re-distinguished between safe borrowing (fixed repayment) and dangerous borrowing (linked to the market). Julia # Sharing: Revealed an American tax trap: the Wash Sale Rule may apply to all accounts (including 401k/IRA and other retirement accounts). If you sell a loss-making asset (such as QQQ) in a taxable account for Tax Loss Harvesting (TLH) and automatically buy a similar asset (such as an SP500 index fund) in a retirement account at the same time, the loss in the taxable account may be permanently disallowed (because retirement accounts are taxed at ordinary income rates when withdrawn, with no capital gains concept). This is especially important for high-tech employees, as they often hold a large number of RSUs and perform TLH. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Tax issues are extremely important. Pointed out that TLH itself also has risks, such as the market rebounding after selling, making it impossible to buy back the original asset (QQQ) at an ideal price, or generating new capital gains when buying back. If James himself has no need (such as no capital gains without selling stocks), he tends to let the loss carry forward and deduct $3,000 of ordinary income each year, rather than use it to offset capital gains. However, for Julia, who needs to offset a large amount of RSU capital gains, TLH is a reasonable strategy and needs to be operated carefully. Discussed the problem of high tax rates in California. Re-emphasized the ultimate goal of pursuing a zero-tax state, and the value of tax planning far exceeds the salary itself. DDF # Question: Asked about the risk of the Pacific War two years ago, at that time the teacher suggested reducing 50% of QQQ. Now that he has adopted the strategy of holding a large amount of cash (such as 433/424), can he withstand this type of risk, insist on holding it and rebalancing at the end of the year, without selling in the middle? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The evolution of the strategy is because the introduction of leveraged instruments allows holding a large amount of cash more effectively. The core risk management issue is not specific events (wars, disasters, etc.), but whether it is possible to survive in extreme market conditions (such as closure/deep decline for 10-15 years). If cash reserves are sufficient to support such a long time, there is no need to make predictive operations for specific events. Comparing risks: for young people, the risk of carrying a mortgage and facing unemployment + market decline may be more realistic and fatal than the risk of war. Buying a house should be as easy and stress-free as buying slippers to be considered affordable. Jason # Sharing: Summarized two major investment risks: Choosing the wrong asset: The market is full of various temptations, choosing a high-quality asset for the long term (such as QQQ) is the foundation. Thanks to the teacher for continuing to emphasize this. Missing the upside: Statistics show that missing the 10 days with the biggest market gains (in the past 20 years) will cut total returns in half. These big rally days often occur during periods of extreme panic (such as 2008, 2020). This confirms the importance of the \u0026ldquo;never sell\u0026rdquo; strategy to avoid timing the market. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Highly Agreed. Defined the real, permanent loss as the returns that should have been earned but were not (such as missing a 12% rally). Book losses caused by market declines are temporary and will recover. Compared buying QQQ at a high point (540) with buying at a low point (440), the difference in annualized returns after holding for 40 years is extremely small (11.98% vs 12.5%), indicating that the timing of the purchase is not important, but long-term holding is key. Use a long-term perspective (40 years later) to review current decisions. Jing # Question: Approaching retirement, but savings have not reached the 30-50x target. There is a stable high income in the next 5 years, and Pension/Social Security will cover most expenses after retirement. Does not use pledging due to concerns about risk. Can I not retain 20% cash and take a 100% stock holding strategy, relying on future income, emergency fund, and future pledgeable options to accelerate asset growth? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: No. Risk tolerance decreases as retirement approaches, the time window is short, and you should be more conservative. Since the Pension already covers most of the expenses, the urgency for asset growth should be reduced. The most aggressive allocation for retirement or near retirement, without using pledges and without holding leveraged funds, is 80% QQQ + 20% cash. Pension should be regarded as a stable source of income, and when calculating the total amount of retirement funds required, the Pension portion should be deducted from annual expenses first, and then the remaining net expenditure needs should be multiplied by a multiple (such as 30 or 50 times). If you hold leveraged funds, you must sell them and deal with tax issues before retirement. Frank (from the comments section) # Question: Should global diversification be carried out? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Not recommended. The U.S. market is optimal in terms of innovation, transparency, and long-term risk-reward ratio. Other markets have higher risks and relatively low return potential. Investing in U.S. index funds is sufficient. IV. Wonderful Views # The first step in investing is not to say, ah, I come in and start, what should the teacher buy, how much leveraged funds should I buy\u0026hellip; No\u0026hellip; The first thing to invest in is how much cash you need, how much cash you need to keep, this is more important than anything. \u0026ndash; James\nBackground: Emphasizes the primacy of cash reserves in investment planning.\nOur strategy has nothing to do with market volatility\u0026hellip; What are investment plans or investments supposed to do?

Summary # This lecture once again consolidates James\u0026rsquo;s core investment philosophy: taking sufficient cash reserves as a prerequisite for ultra-long-term (15+ years) holding of the Nasdaq 100 index fund. It emphasizes the priority of risk management, especially determining the cash ratio based on individual circumstances and building asset allocation based on this, rather than pursuing a specific Beta value or being driven by market sentiment. The differences in risk perception at different life stages and wealth levels were discussed, and the use of high-risk leverage (such as margin trading) for investment was strongly opposed. In addition, practical advice and warnings were shared on tax planning, retirement preparation, financial service selection, and consumption mentality. The Q\u0026amp;A session delved into the specific problems encountered by students in practice, further clarifying strategy details and risk considerations, such as retirement fund calculation, the view on global diversification, and psychological management techniques (focus on overall portfolio rather than local volatility). Overall, this content revolves around the two words \u0026ldquo;determination\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;safety,\u0026rdquo; that is, maintaining strategic determination and financial security in a volatile market, and adhering to the correct principles.\nDisclaimer: This article is only a personal study note and does not constitute any investment advice.

Current Theme # The market is always fluctuating; this is normal. Investors should have a long-term perspective, ignoring short-term volatility and market noise (such as international situations, economic analysis, financial reports, etc.). The core strategy is to hold high-quality index funds (such as QQQ) for the long term, and to make reasonable asset allocation (including cash reserves) based on individual risk tolerance, while overcoming the greed and fear of human nature. Learning and building a firm belief are essential.\nII. Briefing Content # Market Volatility and Long-Term Investing # Market volatility is normal: A 10% market drop is normal, 20% happens about every two or three years, and 50% may happen every five to ten years. This is like the tides, wind, rain, and earthquakes in nature; it\u0026rsquo;s an inevitable natural phenomenon. Don\u0026rsquo;t think \u0026ldquo;this year is different\u0026rdquo;; every year is the same. Importance of a long-term perspective: As long as you stay in the market long enough, you will understand that there is nothing new in the market. The core laws of the market are \u0026ldquo;always rising\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;always fluctuating.\u0026rdquo; Ignore the noise: Market fluctuations, international situations, market analysis, financial reports, and economic situations are all irrelevant to the decisions of long-term investors. Recommended strategy: Hold the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ) for the long term; it can be bought worldwide. This is the simplest and most effective strategy. Interactive request: Hope everyone likes, leaves comments, and most importantly, subscribes on various platforms (Podcast, Bilibili, YouTube). Learning and Mindset # Learning to build belief: Investing is simple (buy index funds), but there are many external distractions (monsters and ghosts). You need to build firm belief and willpower through learning, so that you will not be easily swayed by other people\u0026rsquo;s opinions. Overcoming human weaknesses: Greed and fear are the biggest enemies of investment. Manifestations of greed: Chasing high when the market rises, thinking that the opportunity to \u0026ldquo;buy the dip\u0026rdquo; has come when the market falls, and using up all cash too early (e.g., constantly adding positions when the market has just fallen 5%-13%). Manifestations of fear: Not daring to buy when the market rises, only FOMOing (fear of missing out) All-in when it has risen too much; panicking when the market falls and selling at a loss at the bottom. Importance of cash: Ample cash is a magic weapon to overcome human nature (especially fear), as important as air. It makes you feel comfortable and secure when the market falls. Don\u0026rsquo;t exhaust your cash when the market just starts to fall. Living in the present: Don\u0026rsquo;t dwell on past mistakes (such as losses in real estate investment), don\u0026rsquo;t worry too much about future uncertainties, focus on the present, and do your current investment and learning well. Asset Allocation and Leverage # Finding the comfort zone: Everyone has a different risk tolerance. You need to find your comfortable asset allocation ratio through market fluctuations (such as 442, 433, 523, 514, 505, etc.), and the cash ratio is very important. If you feel uncomfortable when the market falls, you should adjust to a configuration that you can hold with peace of mind during rebounds. Leverage risk: Few people can withstand fluctuations of more than 1.2 times Beta. When the market falls, many people will not be able to stand it and reduce leverage. Don\u0026rsquo;t be overconfident in adding leverage when the market is good. Example: Some people went from 442 to 0.9x leverage or even lower. Rebalancing: It is recommended to do rebalancing once a year. Only use a small amount of cash (e.g., 2% per year) to buy if the market is down at the end of the year. Don\u0026rsquo;t operate frequently or exhaust your cash due to monthly or short-term declines. About full-position leverage: It is not recommended for young people to use \u0026ldquo;full-position two-times leverage,\u0026rdquo; because there will always be a big bubble in life. High leverage may lead to a significant asset drawdown (e.g., falling to 0.1), which is difficult to recover, and you may reach your goal later than with a stable investment. Tortoise and hare: A stable configuration (tortoise) will outperform an aggressive high-leverage strategy (hare) in the long run. Even if the Beta is lower than 1, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. Purpose of secured borrowing: The purpose of secured borrowing is not to pursue extreme returns, but to meet living needs or make better configurations while holding high-quality assets for the long term. The risk lies in the ability to repay the principal, not the interest burden. U.S. Treasury Bonds and the Economy # US Debt Clock Update: The website has been updated, adding data such as DoJ Waste Recovery of federal wasted funds and U.S. Hidden Wealth Assets (including gold, minerals, real estate, land, stocks, Recaptured Assets, etc.). U.S. Balance Sheet (as of March 27, 2025, approximate numbers): Total Assets: Approximately 168 Trillion (T) Federal Government Debt (in bond form): Approximately 36 T Total Liabilities (including credit represented by cash M1/M2, etc.): Approximately 102 T Annual Income (GDP): Approximately 28 T Interpretation: It\u0026rsquo;s like a person having 1.68 million in assets (and the assets are growing at a rate of about 10%), 1.02 million in debt (of which 360,000 is core debt), and an annual salary of 280,000 (which is also growing). The debt is controllable, and the risk of bankruptcy is very low. U.S. dollar cash itself is also a liability, but it will depreciate with inflation, reducing the actual repayment pressure. Interest problem: Federal debt interest expenditure is about 1T, which is controllable relative to federal tax revenue (about 4.9T + state tax) and GDP (28T). There is no need to worry too much about the so-called interest exceeding defense spending (about 0.9T), as this comparison is not meaningful. Clarification of Musk\u0026rsquo;s views: Musk mainly criticized the inefficiency and waste of the U.S. government\u0026rsquo;s spending, rather than the debt itself being unsustainable. Impact of tariffs: Raising tariffs essentially shifts costs to consumers, leading to rising prices, which is equivalent to a disguised tax. This is just a different form from directly collecting federal taxes (paying in installments in daily consumption vs. paying once a year). The impact on the overall economy is complex, but for individuals, it may just be \u0026ldquo;shifting from the left pocket to the right pocket.\u0026rdquo; Other Sharing # HSBC Hong Kong Account Opening Experience (Student Sharing): Threshold: May require assets equivalent to HK$1 million to avoid monthly fees (approximately HK$380). Transaction fee: Relatively high, but has little impact on long-term holders. Stock pledge interest rate: HIBOR + 1.2%, currently about 4.92%, which is acceptable. Suggestion: It is more convenient to sell stocks in other brokerages for cash and transfer them in than to perform complex cross-system transfers. Don\u0026rsquo;t delay important matters for small fees. Canadian Real Estate Investment Issues (Student Sharing): Non-tax residents face high withholding tax on selling property (35% of the selling price, not the profit), and transaction costs are high (brokerage fees, prepayment penalties, lawyer and accounting fees). Conclusion: Houses are \u0026ldquo;invisible cages\u0026rdquo; and tools for governments, the financial industry, and capitalism to bind labor. Don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to sell the house; past investments are sunk costs. James also shared his experience of losing money selling a house in Longtan, Taiwan. Retirement Planning Case (Student Question): NT$15 million in funds + NT$5 million in financial-type mortgage. Suggestion: For the part that needs cash flow, consider buying ETFs such as 0050/0056 that provide dividends, but be aware that their dividends may include principal (selling component stocks). Investment of NT$15 million: If you don\u0026rsquo;t need to withdraw money from it, you can consider leveraged allocation (such as 433); if you need to withdraw money, you cannot use leverage. Choose the allocation based on the withdrawal rate (the amount needed after deducting Social Security benefits) (e.g., 2% withdrawal with 80/20 QQQ/cash; 3% withdrawal with SPY). The withdrawal rate is key, not the traditional 4% rule. Core: Any configuration must consider whether you can withstand a 50% market drop. Tesla FSD Experience (Student and Teacher Sharing): FSD V12 is amazing, close to fully autonomous driving, able to handle complex road conditions (such as San Francisco), and significantly reduces driving stress and fatigue. FSD has a certain \u0026ldquo;perception\u0026rdquo; ability and can judge the intentions of other vehicles/pedestrians and make intelligent reactions. Value: The teacher believes that FSD is worth the money (willing to spend $100,000 to buy it), improves safety (saves lives), improves the driving experience (reduces family quarrels), and may even reduce insurance premiums (using Tesla Insurance). Strongly recommends buying a Tesla car with FSD (the new Model Y comes standard). Use the teacher\u0026rsquo;s referral code for discounts. Consumption Concepts and Family (Student Question): Problem: Family members (such as spouses, parents) continue to demand new car replacements and other consumption due to \u0026ldquo;laborer thinking\u0026rdquo; or material needs, which conflicts with their own goals of accumulating wealth, and they feel annoyed. Teacher\u0026rsquo;s suggestion: Understand the needs and feelings of family members (love what they love). Learn to \u0026ldquo;consume smartly,\u0026rdquo; using financial tools (such as secured loans, adjusting allocation ratios) to meet some reasonable needs without excessively affecting the growth of core investments. For example, sell 100,000 QQQ, exchange it for 50,000 QLD (keeping some exposure) + 50,000 cash to buy a car. The goal of capitalists is to make money generate money and ultimately use it to improve the quality of life, not just to save money. Find a balance between accumulation and consumption. Technology Product Consumption: The teacher shared that buying high-quality displays (Nano-texture display) and AirPods Pro 2 (with hearing aid function, about $249) is to protect health and improve the quality of life. These investments are worthwhile, and financial operations (such as secured loans, credit card rebates reinvestment) can be used to make them feel like \u0026ldquo;no money is spent.\u0026rdquo; Defining Purchasing Power: True purchasing power means that when the purchased items (such as houses and cars) are accidentally damaged, you have the ability to easily buy another one without feeling financial pressure or heartache. Otherwise, you are exceeding your consumption capacity. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # K # Sharing: Often explains to friends that market fluctuations are normal and not to panic. Also dissuaded friends from borrowing too much to invest just because their income could afford the interest. James\u0026rsquo;s comment: Agreed. The main risk of secured borrowing is not the ability to pay interest, but the ability to repay the principal (Margin Call) when the market falls. Adjusting leverage to a comfortable level during market rebounds is important. C # Sharing: Thanks for the teacher\u0026rsquo;s inspiration, sharing that he and a friend were deeply touched and started taking action, but also lamented that many people would rather eat, drink, and have fun than squeeze out a small amount of money to invest each month. Cognition determines wealth. James\u0026rsquo;s comment: Glad to see students agree and execute, eventually becoming wealthy. Shared the example of an early student (2006) who persisted and has achieved financial freedom. Becoming a capitalist requires cognition and persistence, and it is indeed a minority of people. Tommy # Sharing: Reviewed his 16-year investment journey: early purchases of 0050/0056 -\u0026gt; chasing biotech stocks (heavy losses) -\u0026gt; starting to invest in U.S. stocks (VOO/VTI/bonds, diversified) after the pandemic -\u0026gt; epiphany after listening to the course, and is now concentrating assets into QQQ. Realized that dividends (0056) are not as good as total return (0050), paying off the mortgage too early was a wrong decision, and the cost of time is terrible. Question 1: Should asset allocation (such as 442/433) be achieved on all accounts (Taiwan, US Brokerage, IRA, Roth 401k, etc.) as a whole, or should each account follow? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: All accounts should be regarded as a whole for allocation. Leveraged funds (such as QLD) can only be placed in tax-free growth Roth accounts. Cash can be placed in Brokerage or Traditional IRA/401k (doing so can slow down the growth of pre-tax accounts, which is beneficial for future taxes). The final Beta value will be limited by the size of the Roth account. Even if the Beta is lower than 1, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. Stability (tortoise) may outperform aggression (hare). Question 2: There are historical contributions in Traditional 401k (mutual funds have been converted to QQQ), and now it is a mix of Roth and Traditional. Should the Traditional portion be converted to Roth? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Whether to convert depends on the amount and current tax rate. If the amount is not large, you can convert it all at once. If the amount is large (e.g., 500,000), in order to avoid high tax burdens, it should be converted over many years. You can use the Investment Calculator to calculate how much amount to convert each year to reduce the Traditional balance to zero within a set period (e.g., 10 years) while controlling the annual tax burden. Fidelity clearly distinguishes the shares of Roth and Traditional internally. MMA # Sharing: Experienced Tesla FSD V12 and felt it was very good. 99% of the journey can be driven automatically, including handling cut-ins, traffic jams, and complex slopes in San Francisco, which greatly improves driving efficiency and comfort. Admired Tesla\u0026rsquo;s technology and efficiency (the AI ​​department has few people but significant results). James\u0026rsquo;s comment: Very much agree. FSD is not just mechanical execution, but can also \u0026ldquo;feel\u0026rdquo; the intentions of other vehicles and pedestrians and make intelligent judgments. FSD greatly reduces driving pressure and improves safety (saves lives). Using FSD also helps reduce the insurance premium for Tesla Insurance. Strongly recommends buying a Tesla with FSD, and stocks can be held through QQQ. Iam # Sharing: Encountered a brokerage that promoted an IPO and realized that it was an interference from \u0026ldquo;monsters and ghosts.\u0026rdquo; Question: How to deal with close people (parents, spouses, children) who continue to hold \u0026ldquo;laborer thinking\u0026rdquo; and constantly demand material consumption (such as changing to a new car), which conflicts with their own wealth accumulation philosophy and feels annoyed and pressured? Is there a good way to deal with it? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Understanding and love: Understand the needs of family members and love them (love what they love). Meeting reasonable needs is part of maintaining family harmony. Smart consumption: Capitalists don\u0026rsquo;t not consume, but consume smartly. Use financial tools (secured loans, adjusting investment portfolios such as selling QQQ for QLD + cash) to meet consumption needs as much as possible without affecting the compound growth of core assets. Balance: Find a balance between wealth accumulation and enjoyment of life. It is not necessary to meet all requirements, but it is not possible to completely reject them. It is necessary to meet one or two needs that family members value every year or every few years. No need to explain too much: Actions speak louder than words. Express love through practical actions (such as buying a car), but there is no need to argue too much about concepts. Ling # Sharing: Describes a complex arbitrage strategy: Using secured borrowing (leverage may exceed 1.5 times), puts some funds into a digital account in Taiwan (about 2% interest), and buys 00864B (USD money market fund) to try to cover the 2.8% borrowing cost. Also shared how to use credit card payments to get 0% interest installments and then use the money to buy 00864B for arbitrage. Question: Is this operation feasible? Does it conform to the 442 configuration idea? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Not 442: What you described is an arbitrage strategy, not the 442 asset allocation based on long-term growth that we discussed. Arbitrage efficiency: Putting borrowed money (cost 2.8%) into a NTD account with 2% interest is losing money. All of it should be put into 00864B with higher returns (about 4.5%) and matching currencies (USD) for arbitrage. Exchange rate fluctuations are not important. Credit card arbitrage: It is feasible to use 0% interest installments for arbitrage, but it is a \u0026ldquo;sesame green bean\u0026rdquo; small trick and should not be distracted too much. Risk: As long as the target (00864B) itself does not fall, this pure arbitrage strategy has low risk and will not be margin called. Sandy # Sharing: Experienced the 2008 financial crisis, assets were halved, and since then has attached importance to cash, maintaining 30-40% cash all year round. Dared to buy in when the market fell sharply in 2022 and made a profit at the end of the year. Question 1: Made considerable profits last year and early this year and wanted to sell some at a high level to avoid a callback, but her husband prevented it because of concerns about high taxes (believing that it would push the tax bracket to 50%). How to deal with it? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Her husband\u0026rsquo;s understanding of tax law is wrong. Long-term Capital Gain Tax is calculated separately from ordinary income tax. Its tax rate is tiered (usually 0%, 15%, 20%), and the highest is 20% (plus a possible 3.8% NIIT). Selling capital gains will not push ordinary income to an extremely high tax bracket (such as 50%). The tax rate for selling a lot of LTCG is basically fixed (it is 20% after reaching a certain amount). However, it is not recommended to time the market to sell. If you really want to operate, you should prioritize doing so in retirement accounts (such as IRA/401k). Selling has no immediate tax impact, and you can even buy reverse ETFs (such as SQQQ) for hedging in retirement accounts (advanced operation, not recommended). Question 2: Is it better to buy dividend-paying stocks or other things with the cash (Money Market) held? Worried about the tax on dividend-paying stocks. James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Don\u0026rsquo;t use dividend-paying stocks to hold cash, the tax efficiency is low. You should use money market funds. If you want to avoid both federal and state taxes, you can consider municipal bond funds (Muni Bond Fund, such as Vanguard\u0026rsquo;s VOOX). If you only consider federal tax, you can use U.S. Treasury money market funds (such as SGOV, BIL). There is a capital gains tax problem only when selling. Question 3: I want to anonymously sponsor a talented child (a friend\u0026rsquo;s child, with decent family conditions), but I don\u0026rsquo;t want the other party to know now, how to operate? Worried about tax issues. James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Anonymous operation is difficult, especially involving opening an account. And the other party\u0026rsquo;s family may not need sponsorship. A safer way is to write this child (providing name, address, and other information) into your own trust file as a beneficiary of future inheritance. This operation is simple and usually tax-free. CL # Question 1: In the United States, in addition to mortgage loans and stock pledges, what other similar low-cost sources of funds can be used like \u0026ldquo;Han Xin counting soldiers\u0026rdquo;? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: The U.S. financial market is highly efficient and has a lot of \u0026ldquo;smart money,\u0026rdquo; so the interest rate on unsecured personal loans is usually higher (such as 8% +). Unlike Taiwan, which has a large amount of low-cost funds (due to export-oriented currency abundance), there are indeed not many other low-cost, flexible sources of funds besides stock pledges (Pledge Loan). If you have channels in Taiwan to borrow low-interest NTD funds, you can consider it. Question 2: Regarding children\u0026rsquo;s college tuition fees, is it better for them to apply for student loans themselves (and we will use the pledged money to pay them back after graduation), or to pay directly with the pledged money? Which is better? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: There is no absolute right or wrong, it depends on the child\u0026rsquo;s personality and feelings. If the child feels stressed about debt, pay directly. If the child understands financial leverage and the student loan conditions are favorable (such as interest only after graduation), you can let them take out the loan and the parents will pay it back later. The key is to communicate well with the child. The teacher shared his experience of paying his daughter\u0026rsquo;s tuition fees directly. Sharing: Fortunate to have followed the teacher\u0026rsquo;s advice to sell the expensive house in Los Angeles and exchange it for a cheaper one and use a pledge loan. Now I feel relaxed, unlike some friends who are trapped in expensive houses and facing difficulties under the wave of layoffs. James\u0026rsquo;s comment: Yes, real estate has poor liquidity, especially when bought at a high price, which easily limits life choices and financial flexibility. Young people should be especially cautious. Hao Qing (浩清) # Sharing: Told about his difficult experiences in the United States in the early stages of immigration: meager salary (less than 30,000 USD/year), relying on friends to introduce jobs, being questioned by the boss for his ability, saving money, working long hours and studying every day to support his family. Shared the process and feelings of raising three children: Children are motivation and will find their own way out. Responded to the teacher\u0026rsquo;s video case about hesitating whether to have a third child, encouraged having children, and believed that children have their own future. James\u0026rsquo;s comment: Shared his own experience of being poor when he first came to the United States (borrowing money to come to the United States, living in Motel 6, cooking by himself). Emphasized that the hardship of life is a process and also a valuable wealth and memory. Encouraged everyone to face life challenges bravely. Marriage and childbirth are not that terrible, love is the key, and money is usually not the biggest problem. Terry # Question 1: Concerns about U.S. Treasury bonds (such as the debt-to-GDP ratio, interest burden), is it possible that the world will stop buying U.S. bonds? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: U.S. assets (168T) far exceed debt (federal debt 36T). The interest burden is controllable relative to fiscal revenue and GDP. Countries around the world hold a large amount of USD reserves and must purchase USD assets (government bonds, treasury bills, money market funds, etc.) to store them. There are no other large-scale options to replace them. Therefore, the world will not stop buying U.S. bonds. A strong U.S. dollar is in the best interest of the United States. Question 2: The price of SGOV (short-term treasury bond ETF) is rising slightly every day, while the price of TLT (long-term treasury bond ETF) has been falling recently, why? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: SGOV tracks short-term interest rates. Its mechanism is to accrue interest accumulation daily and the net value returns after dividends, showing a step-like slight oscillation. TLT represents long-term treasury bonds, and its price (yield) mainly reflects the market\u0026rsquo;s expectations for future long-term inflation. If the market expects inflation to rise in the future (for example, worrying about tariffs leading to inflation), the yield on long-term treasury bonds will rise and the price of TLT will fall. This has little to do with the Fed\u0026rsquo;s current short-term interest rate policy. IV.

Summary # In this CLEC investment and financial management sharing session, James reiterated the core philosophy of long-term investment: embrace market volatility, adhere to holding index funds represented by QQQ, and build firm belief through continuous learning. The teacher analyzed the real situation of U.S. Treasury bonds in detail, believing that there is no need to worry too much, and clarified the misunderstanding about its interest burden and Musk\u0026rsquo;s criticism. At the same time, it discussed the rational use of leverage, the importance of cash reserves (like air and magic weapons), and how to overcome psychological biases in investment. The Q\u0026amp;A session involved asset allocation across accounts, Roth conversion, real estate processing (including Canadian non-resident tax issues and personal experience), children\u0026rsquo;s education funding planning, the excellent value and experience of Tesla FSD, consumption concept balance (smart consumption vs. laborer thinking), the limited sources of low-cost funds in the United States, the driving factor differences between long-term and short-term treasury bond ETFs, and the correct understanding of U.S. long-term capital gains tax and other practical issues, providing specific operational suggestions and thinking frameworks. The core message is to maintain a long-term perspective, make rational decisions, use financial tools to achieve a balance between wealth growth and quality of life, while understanding and respecting the needs of the people around you.\nDisclaimer: This article is for personal study notes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Current Topic # This episode mainly discusses how to conduct reasonable asset allocation in the event of market fluctuations. The core idea is: Invest in the US Nasdaq Index Fund, hold it for the long term, ignore short-term market fluctuations, manage risks well, and adjust the asset allocation ratio according to your own circumstances. The core lies in establishing an investment mindset that is \u0026ldquo;independent\u0026rdquo; of market fluctuations, with the focus on asset allocation and risk tolerance that suit you.\nII. Briefing Content # 1. Concentration of Funds and Borrowing for Investment # Concentration of Funds: Concentrate all investable funds into one account to avoid difficulty in grasping the overall asset situation due to scattered accounts. This includes bank deposits, stocks, funds, etc. James emphasizes that you should thoroughly count your assets like \u0026ldquo;counting soldiers painstakingly,\u0026rdquo; so that you know your situation well. Borrowing for Investment: Actively use tools such as credit and mortgage-linked wealth management loans to use the borrowed funds for investment, and do not let the funds sit idle in the bank \u0026ldquo;blowing cold air.\u0026rdquo; The interest rates on credit and mortgage-linked wealth management loans are usually lower than the yield of US 00864B, so borrowing to invest can generate interest spread. Note: Restrictions on Stock-Pledged Loans: Should not be used directly for large-scale reinvestment, but can be used in small amounts (e.g., 2%) to supplement funds for \u0026ldquo;beautiful (daily) transfers.\u0026rdquo; Assess Repayment Ability: Ensure that monthly available salary is stable for repayment to avoid excessive borrowing. Total Assets: Include all investable funds (including borrowed funds) in the total assets for unified allocation. This provides a more comprehensive perspective for managing risk and optimizing returns. 2. Asset Allocation Ratio # Office Workers: It is recommended to adopt an asset allocation ratio of 442 or 433. These ratios represent a balance between risk and return, and are suitable for investors with different risk preferences. Among them: 442: 40% Index Fund (e.g., QQQ), 40% Leveraged Fund (e.g., QLD), 20% Cash. Suitable for investors with higher risk tolerance. 433 Beta 1.0: 40% Index Fund (e.g., QQQ), 30% Leveraged Fund (Beta 1.0, leveraged fund with lower volatility), 30% Cash. Suitable for investors seeking steady returns. You can also choose a more conservative configuration of Beta 0.8 or Beta 0.5 to reduce volatility. Do it All at Once: Asset allocation should be done in one step, without procrastination, to avoid hesitation due to market fluctuations. Execute immediately and don\u0026rsquo;t let \u0026ldquo;hesitation\u0026rdquo; become a stumbling block for investment. Annual Rebalancing: Conduct passive rebalancing once a year, instead of actively operating according to market fluctuations. Specific methods: Market Rises: Transfer one-third of the increased value of the leveraged fund to cash to lock in some profits and reduce portfolio risk. Market Falls: Take 2% of total assets from cash and invest in leveraged funds to increase investment during market downturns. Total Asset Benchmark: The benchmark for rebalancing is the initially set total asset amount, not the later increased amount, unless the asset allocation is re-evaluated and adjusted. Ignore Market Fluctuations: All investment decisions are independent of market fluctuations, and adhere to a long-term investment strategy. Don\u0026rsquo;t panic because the market is falling, and don\u0026rsquo;t be greedy because the market is rising. James emphasizes that our investment \u0026ldquo;ignores\u0026rdquo; the existence of the market. No matter how the market fluctuates, we adhere to the established asset allocation plan. 3. Risk Tolerance and Beta Value # Risk Control: The only controllable risk is raising the cash position. Other systematic risks (such as war, economic crisis, etc.) cannot be controlled. Trying to control systematic risks is futile. Even Buffett can only cope by increasing cash reserves. Risk Tolerance: Test your own risk tolerance through market declines, and choose the Beta value that suits you. Market declines are the best time to test whether asset allocation is reasonable, and also a great opportunity to understand your own risk tolerance. Beta Value Selection: Beta 1.2: High volatility, suitable for investors with high risk tolerance. Beta 1.0: Moderate volatility. Beta 0.8 or lower: Low volatility, suitable for investors with low risk tolerance. Drop Two Levels: If you feel too much pressure during a market downturn, it is recommended to drop two levels on the Beta value that you currently think is safe to ensure a more comfortable investment experience. Avoid Chasing Highs and Selling Lows: After determining the Beta value, do not change it frequently to avoid chasing highs and selling lows. Frequent changes in the Beta value will lead to confusion in the investment strategy, which may eventually outweigh the benefits. Cash Ratio: Regardless of the asset allocation adopted, the cash ratio should be maintained at 20% or higher. This provides a sufficient safety buffer to cope with emergencies. 4. Family Financial Planning # Family Drama: Understand the complexity of family relationships. Everyone has their own role. Learn to use wisdom to deal with family financial problems. Family financial problems are common. Every family is like a big drama, and the roles and scripts have been set long ago. Decluttering: Learn to declutter, don\u0026rsquo;t over-contribute, be selfish a little when necessary, and protect your own interests. Especially when it comes to taking care of parents, clearly define the division of responsibilities to avoid taking on too much burden alone for a long time. Communicate Early: The sooner you communicate with siblings about sharing parental expenses and care responsibilities, the easier it is to reach a consensus and avoid future conflicts. Money Issues: Ultimately, many family problems will boil down to money issues. Face them honestly and seek solutions. 5. Investment Philosophy # Spending Money is the Purpose of Life: Making money is for spending money. Think about how to spend money reasonably and improve your spiritual energy. Money should not be a constraint, but should serve personal growth and happiness. Awakening: Recognize the essence of capitalism, don\u0026rsquo;t be deceived by external financial institutions, and strive to realize your dreams. Avoid blindly following the idea of \u0026ldquo;everyone does this\u0026rdquo; and have the ability to think independently. Simple Investment: Simplify investment and don\u0026rsquo;t spend too much time and energy. Set a strategy, stick to it in the long term, and reduce unnecessary intervention. Life Experience: Life is for experiencing. Be brave to try and don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of failure. Don\u0026rsquo;t miss the opportunity to experience life because you are afraid of risk. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Eray # Sharing: Asset Beta 1.2 has been allocated and affordable loans have been fully borrowed. This indicates a clear understanding of one\u0026rsquo;s own risk tolerance. Profited from investing in Yinjian shares in the past, but policy changes have increased the risk, indicating that investing in individual stocks is risky. Emphasizes the importance of diversification and the advantages of index funds. Conservatively calculated, it is expected to reach 50 times the annual spending in nine years and achieve retirement. Demonstrates the potential of long-term investment. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Congratulations on retiring early and enjoying your life. Rui # Sharing: Because the performance of individual stocks was better than QQQ last year, I switched all to 442 configuration after listening to the teacher\u0026rsquo;s advice, avoiding future individual stock risks. Emphasizes the importance of long-term investment in index funds and avoiding individual stock risks. It is recommended that everyone switch other individual stocks to the index funds recommended by the teacher when the decline is large. Provides practical advice for other investors. Question: When withdrawing 2% of 50 times the annual spending, is inflation considered, and will the withdrawal ratio be increased due to inflation? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Inflation will not significantly increase the cost of living in the short term. If you feel pressure after five years, you can re-evaluate your assets and increase the withdrawal amount, but the maximum is 2% of the adjusted assets. Emphasizes the flexibility of asset allocation, which can be adjusted according to the actual situation. RosMary # Question: The voice in the Q\u0026amp;A section of the CLEC short film is not the teacher\u0026rsquo;s. Is this normal? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Normal. The short film uses computer text-to-speech to release information faster. Explains the short film production method and thanks for understanding. Jiu # Sharing: 433 configuration has been completed, and stock pledge and credit are available, and there is no problem with cash flow. Question: Some banks in Taiwan provide mortgage-linked wealth management loans that can be used cyclically for people under 75 years old. There are still 30 years left for 45 years old. Is there a better way to use this? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Borrow all the money you can borrow. As long as you persist long enough and are not affected by market fluctuations, investment cannot lose money for more than 15 years. It is recommended to assess your tolerance when the market falls by 20% before deciding on the loan amount. James emphasizes confidence in long-term investment and the importance of assessing risks. Lynn (Lucy) # Question: How to understand asset allocation 433, what does it mean?\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Reply: It refers to 40% Index Fund (e.g., QQQ), 30% Leveraged Fund (e.g., QLD), and 30% Cash. Question: Financial science articles say that the portfolio needs to be rebalanced frequently. What does it mean?\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Reply: This channel is completely different from what people outside say. This channel only invests in QQQ and ignores market fluctuations. You can refer to the historical videos on the YouTube channel (starting from 00398). Question: I used to work in the United States for a few years, so I have an IRA account there. Now I have closed it and took out all the money. 20% tax was withheld. Do I still need to file taxes in the United States?\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Reply: You can file it and get it back after filing the tax. James reminds you to try to apply for a tax refund. Sharon # Question: 401K company match, so 401K can transfer to traditional IRO. But if you want to earn ROS, you must be in a situation where the tax rate is very low, and there is no way to directly save. Is the logic correct that you can only transfer to rus to invest from there after we both retire? If we just sell our cash property houses and cash, and then directly deposit that investment, is that right? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Try to allocate your 401K as much as possible and allocate it to R. Because the company\u0026rsquo;s Dr has nothing to do with income. Whether you want to transfer your old traditional to R401K depends on your tax rate. Give you a number and calculate it with you now. You should convert how much each year. James emphasizes that you can determine whether to convert based on the calculation. Based on the current volume of 800,000 US dollars, if it is covered with an annualized return of 12% in 15 years, you need to convert 100,000 US dollars each year. If you retire five years later and use 220,000 US dollars for tax filing, the tax rate will be higher. You should retire early to do the convert. You can put it in brokerage. You can just put it directly, right? It is still worth putting it. James suggests starting investing as soon as possible and not letting cash sit idle. Ly # Sharing: Joined CLEC in September 2023. I am very grateful to the teacher for opening up my financial quotient. The 433 configuration has been completed, and I don’t feel anything about this wave of decline because I can do pledge and credit. Question: Mortgage-linked wealth management loans can be used to borrow new ones to repay old ones. 75 years old can continue to borrow cyclically. 45 years old still has 30 years. Is there a better way to use this? With 33 times the annual spending in assets, can selling rental houses to achieve 40 times allow you to stop working? A two-times leveraged QQQ in Canada has a small scale. Is it safe? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: You should just go and borrow it without hesitation, as long as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t want me to repay it, or ask me to repay it after 40 years. As long as you invest for more than 15 years, you cannot lose money, so 30 years is guaranteed to have at least a 9% return, so there is no problem. The key is that you have to persist long enough and not be affected by market fluctuations, which is more important. How will you feel if the market you borrow from this mortgage-linked wealth management loan falls by 20% from today? Just ask yourself. If you are okay, then it is okay. Living off 2-3% of your current QQQ and SPY (75% and 25%) is better than selling the rental house. The safety of the ETF has nothing to do with its volume. As long as you can buy and sell it, it\u0026rsquo;s fine. IV.

Current Topic # The core of this episode is to analyze the specific operation process, risk control points, and broker selection criteria of stock financing in mainland China, while also taking into account the management of investment psychology. The aim is to help investors utilize financial tools for asset appreciation while ensuring risk control and compliance. Teacher James emphasizes the concept of long-term investment and cautions investors not to be affected by short-term market fluctuations.\nII. Briefing Content # 1. Stock Financing # Cost of Capital: Three common types of loans in China: Personal Credit Loan: For individuals with stable jobs, such as civil servants. No collateral is required. Borrowers can obtain 200,000 to 300,000 RMB with an annual interest rate of around 3%. Typically, only interest is paid for the first three years, followed by principal repayment. Mortgage-backed Business Loan: Requires the borrower to have a business. Real estate is used as collateral. It is possible to arrange a loan where only interest is paid for the first ten years, followed by principal repayment. The current lowest annual interest rate can reach 2.4%. Broker Stock Financing: Financing services provided by brokers. Currently, friendly brokers in China can offer an annual interest rate of 4%, which can be reduced to 3.6% depending on the asset amount. Stock financing is the best borrowing method. The key is that the principal can be extended indefinitely, interest accrual can be deferred indefinitely, and the loan duration is considered 0. This means that, in theory, the principal never needs to be repaid; only interest needs to be paid. Prerequisites: Choosing the Best Broker: Compare the fees and interest charging methods of different brokers. Choose the broker with the lowest interest rate and the most favorable repayment policy. Familiarize Yourself with Stock Financing Rules: Understand concepts like margin ratio, warning line, and liquidation line to avoid the risk of forced liquidation due to improper operation. Stock financing is essentially borrowing money to speculate in stocks, and high-leverage operations should be approached with caution. Coordinate the General Account and Margin Account: Understand the rules for transferring funds and stocks between the two accounts. Combine the \u0026ldquo;Never Sell Nasdaq\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Never Repay Debt\u0026rdquo; Strategies: Use long-term holdings of the Nasdaq as collateral to utilize low-cost financing for other investments or consumption. Specific Operation: Having over 500,000 RMB in Nasdaq assets allows you to open a stock financing account (margin account) with a broker. Transfer the Nasdaq ETF (e.g., 513100) from the general account to the margin account as collateral. Example using 10% financing: Use the financing to buy 100,000 RMB worth of Nasdaq ETF. After the transaction is completed, transfer the ETF to the general account through collateral transfer (can only be transferred on the second trading day). Sell the Nasdaq ETF in the general account to obtain cash, which can be used for other investments or consumption. Most brokers offer a six-month extension service, which can theoretically be extended indefinitely as long as interest is paid on time. Considerations When Choosing a Broker: Interest Calculation Method: Some brokers calculate interest including the start date but excluding the end date, while others include both. The latter will charge one more day of interest. Whether Unpaid Interest Incurs Penalties: Pay attention to the broker\u0026rsquo;s charging policy for interest overdrafts. Whether Unpaid Interest is Included in Debt (Simple/Compound Interest): The best situation is simple interest accounting, where unpaid interest does not accrue to the financing debt. Summary: Find a broker with low interest, simple interest accounting, and where unpaid interest is not transferred to the financing debt. Familiarize Yourself with Financing Rules (Focus on Margin Ratio): Margin Ratio = Total Account Assets / Total Financing Amount. Only stocks with a margin ratio exceeding 300% can be transferred to the general account, indicating that excessive borrowing prevents transfers. Warning Line: If the margin ratio is 150%, the broker will notify you to add margin or make a repayment. Liquidation Line: If the margin ratio is 130%, the broker will forcibly liquidate, selling stocks to repay the debt. Example: 1 million RMB in Nasdaq, financed 100,000 RMB, transfer 100,000 RMB worth of Nasdaq to the general account. Margin Ratio = 1 million RMB / 100,000 RMB = 1000%, very safe. If 513100 drops 85%, the total account assets remaining are 150,000 RMB, and the margin ratio reaches 150%, triggering the warning line. If 513100 drops 87%, the total account assets remaining are 130,000 RMB, and the margin ratio reaches 130%, triggering the liquidation line. Why Do This: Chinese Broker Rules: If there is cash in the margin account, it will be used to repay the stock loan principal first. By transferring the financed Nasdaq to the general account and selling it, you can obtain cash. There is no capital gains tax in China, and the commission is extremely low, as low as 0.05% for some brokers. The operation is completely compliant and in accordance with the broker\u0026rsquo;s financing rules. It is recommended that the stock pledge ratio should not exceed 10%, which is considered a safe leverage. Operational Precautions: Always keep zero cash in the margin account. When you need to invest more funds to buy 513100, transfer the funds to the general account to purchase and then transfer them to the margin account. When you need to borrow money and sell stocks, transfer the financed portion to the general account to sell and convert it to cash. 2. Supplementary Notes on Domestic Stock Financing in China # Thanks to Teacher James\u0026rsquo; selfless dedication, taking the elimination of poverty as his lifelong career. Sharing being \u0026ldquo;electrified\u0026rdquo; by the 00451 video, agreeing with its underlying logic and belief, buying all 513100 and holding it for the long term. Thinking about how to borrow low-cost \u0026ldquo;garbage\u0026rdquo; (debt) and convert it into assets, let the assets grow by compound interest, never sell, let the debt be accounted for by simple interest and never be repaid, at most borrow new debt to repay old debt, to ensure that the assets are not damaged. Amazed that Teacher James\u0026rsquo; investment system continues to evolve, from the initial 70% QQQ to InQQQ, and then integrating credit, stock pledges, leveraged funds, and cash to form an all-around large-scale operational system across sea, land, and air. Due to the imperfect financial tools in China, there are no stock pledges and leveraged funds, so it can only stay at the Nasdaq credit stage, and the power is greatly reduced. Emphasize practicing internal strength, learning Teacher James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy and spirit, combining it with the domestic financial environment, integrating it, and driving it with profound internal strength. Supplement the comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of stock pledge/financing from the perspective of learning, thinking, and practice: Taxation: The United States has a capital gains tax, while the securities account in China is similar to the American ROTH IRA, which is tax-free. Nasdaq assets grow by compound interest, and financing is accounted for by simple interest, doubling the happiness. Interest: The interest rate on stock pledges in the United States is relatively high, currently about 7%+, and it is compounded into the debt; the interest rate on stock financing in China is relatively low, about 4%, with simple interest accounting, which is more cost-effective in the long run. Mechanism: Stock pledges in the United States can only be used for consumption, with a safety buffer, and are relatively stable; currently, in China, it can only be used by converting stock financing into cash for consumption, which is riskier and requires strict control of the proportion within 10%. Humanity: Emphasize controlling risks, including controlling humanity. Greed when rising, fear when falling. The teacher changed from the previous 20% M to strictly prohibiting financing, because when the number of people increases, it is difficult to comply with the safety margin, and fear will be amplified when it falls. Principle: Financial tools are neutral, and the risk lies in the user. 3. Others # Nasdaq 100 is listed in Hong Kong (code 03455). Recommend listening to books and podcasts on YouTube Music. Using YouTube Music allows you to listen only to audio, saving data. You can listen to the CLEC channel through YouTube podcasts. The 2025 Buffett Shareholder Meeting can be found on YouTube. Li Lu\u0026rsquo;s speech is worth listening to. He not only talks about investment, but also macroeconomics and social systems, and has in-depth analysis of the Japanese and Chinese systems. III. Q\u0026amp;A # Dev # Sharing: Supplementing the premise of stock pledge borrowing in mainland China, there may be policy risks with brokers, who may require immediate debt repayment at any time. Therefore, it is necessary to always keep enough cash to cover the debt. Teacher James\u0026rsquo; Comment: Emphasizes that borrowing should not exceed 10%, otherwise, it is not meaningful. If you buy leveraged funds in Hong Kong and keep a certain proportion of cash, you can break through the 10% limit and achieve a similar effect to the American 442. JOYCE # Question: Living in the US, there is no credit loan like in Taiwan. Besides HLOC, are there any other ways to borrow to accelerate asset growth? Teacher James\u0026rsquo; Reply: There are no credit loans in the United States, and the interest rates on credit cards are very high. Due to cultural reasons, credit loans are more common in Taiwan and China, and the interest rates are also lower. James # Question 1: For the 442 asset allocation, when it falls, you need to add 2% to QLD, but LIIA can only put in $7,000 per year, which is not enough. How to deal with it? Should a portion of the two layers of cash be placed in LIIA? Teacher James\u0026rsquo; Reply: No. Keep cash in a Traditional IRA or Brokerage Account, preferably in a Traditional IRA for better tax benefits. Do a Conversion, from IRA to Roth IRA to add leverage, especially when the market falls, it is more beneficial to do Conversion. Transferring the same 100 shares of QQQ requires less funds when it falls. Or convert QLD to TQQQ, but it is not recommended. If you must do this, calculate how much QLD needs to be converted to TQQQ to achieve 2% leverage. Question 2: Two weeks ago, the teacher said that QQQ would rise higher after the adjustment. In these two weeks, QQQ has declined. Did the teacher see the phenomenon and predict the adjustment, or did he just say it casually, and it happened to fall? Teacher James\u0026rsquo; Reply: Unspeakable, don\u0026rsquo;t know. Even if I knew, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say. The key is that you should not try to predict the market. Even if you have escaped a few bubbles, you cannot guarantee that you will succeed every time. VIC # Question: I have 1 million in loan funds. Should I use 721 or 633 for asset allocation? I am currently working and have some time before retirement. Teacher James\u0026rsquo; Reply: You can choose 442 or 433. 442 is more aggressive and suitable for young people. 442 is 40% QQQ/006200, 40% QLD/00679L, 20% cash 864B. Balance according to the proportion at the end of the year. Supplement: Risk tolerance is very important. Find a comfortable situation for yourself. Investment is not about pursuing the highest rate of return, but about being stable. 50% investment and 50% cash is also very comfortable, and the return rate can also reach 9.25%. Further Supplement: For stock pledge borrowing, Smart Rebalancing is based on the initial assets. When the market rises, move 30% of the appreciation for the year to cash. Emphasize referring to the Smart Rebalancing document. One More Supplement: The 2% of 442 comes from cash to supplement leveraged funds. Ah Xia # Sharing: Contacted the teacher\u0026rsquo;s course in October last year. After the New Year, I put all my mortgage into it. Now I block all stock market news and focus on work and spending time with my family. Teacher James\u0026rsquo; Comment: Well done. Question: If my family needs money, can I borrow a small amount from the stock pledge as household expenses? Teacher James\u0026rsquo; Reply: Absolutely correct, that\u0026rsquo;s the purpose of stock pledges. Supplement: If you are truly proficient, you can remove the app and place orders by calling the broker. Further Supplement: Market fluctuations have nothing to do with me, international situations have nothing to do with me, market analysis has nothing to do with me, financial reports have nothing to do with me, economic situations have nothing to do with me, everything has nothing to do with me, ignore the deep ups and downs of the market. Kk # Question: Why shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we buy when the market falls?\nTeacher James\u0026rsquo; Reply: You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have any bullets when it falls. All bullets should have been fired. A fall means you have already made a lot of money. Question: I just sold a house. How should I buy?\nTeacher James\u0026rsquo; Reply: Buy everything at the market price immediately. There is nothing to hesitate about. If you always keep cash and prepare to buy when it falls, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be listening to my class. Haoqin # Question: What do you think of TSMC building a factory in the United States and setting up an R\u0026amp;D department in the United States? Teacher James\u0026rsquo; Reply: It is very normal to move towards a truly world-class company. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, the company\u0026rsquo;s decisions are based on maximizing its own interests. It is normal to set up R\u0026amp;D in the United States. Whether it surpasses Taiwan is not important. It is all for TSMC\u0026rsquo;s use. Don\u0026rsquo;t use it too outrageously. Does Microsoft need to explain to all Americans when it opens an R\u0026amp;D center in Taiwan? TSMC should not be linked to the \u0026ldquo;national protection mountain.\u0026rdquo; Don\u0026rsquo;t have a small-country mentality. You should be happy that TSMC has become a world-class company. The most talented people in the United States are not going into factories now. The most talented people in the United States are doing software. Yao # Sharing: I just came across the teacher\u0026rsquo;s channel two weeks ago. Besides working and sleeping, I have been listening to the teacher\u0026rsquo;s videos and continuing to invest. My sleep quality has improved, and I pay less attention to financial news. Teacher James\u0026rsquo; Comment: Well done. Question: I have a lot of pressure at work. Do you have any good suggestions? Teacher James\u0026rsquo; Reply: It\u0026rsquo;s not that important. Don\u0026rsquo;t think too highly of yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s not your problem if the world collapses. Do only three things a day. Finish them and go home. Don\u0026rsquo;t put all the monkeys on your shoulders. If you are stressed, go out and eat ice cream. Give yourself time to relax. Others # Question: I have some investments in Taiwan and will have a fixed income in New Taiwan Dollars every year. Should I buy 00662 or convert it to US dollars to buy QQQ?\nTeacher James\u0026rsquo; Reply: Keep it in Taiwan and buy 00662 first. Convert to the United States after you have status. You can apply for a credit loan in Taiwan and use 662 as collateral to borrow. Question: About BXMX.\nTeacher James\u0026rsquo; Reply: BXMX is a box trade that earns time value. It is essentially arbitrage. Time value is close to the risk-free rate, which is the federal funds rate. BXMX is tax-free. People with dividend tax need to use BXMX, which can be used to legally avoid taxes in the United States. You can apply for a refund of the withholding tax, but the operation is complicated. Supplement: Consider account risks, inheritance risks, especially for overseas accounts. Question: Can I put money in a money market if I have money to invest?\nTeacher James\u0026rsquo; Reply: Of course, you can put money in a Money Market once you have the funds to invest. Question: I have to withdraw a certain amount from my retirement account every year to pay taxes.\nTeacher James\u0026rsquo; Reply: The withholding tax amount is enough to pay the taxes. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to withdraw money from your retirement account to pay taxes. This situation is not normal. IV. Key Takeaways # Market analysis has nothing to do with me. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis emphasizes that long-term investors should ignore short-term market fluctuations and focus on long-term value investing.\nYou have to train until there is no market, you have to train until we investors train to ignore the existence of the market. \u0026ndash; Ah Xia\nThis emphasizes the importance of mentality in the investment process, to overcome human greed and fear, and not to be affected by market sentiment.\nSince you have already recognized the teacher\u0026rsquo;s path, don\u0026rsquo;t let those outside messages affect your normal life. \u0026ndash; Ah Xia\nThis encourages investors to stick to their own investment strategies and not be easily interfered with by external information.\nCultivation comes from falling. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis illustrates that the path of investment is not smooth sailing, and you need to experience the test of the market to truly grow.\nA truly good building is not made by the builder, but by the designer. \u0026ndash; Haoqin\nThis is a metaphor, illustrating that in the value chain, the importance of design and concept is often higher than execution.\nThe concept is the most valuable. \u0026ndash; Haoqin\nEchoing the previous point, emphasizing the importance of innovation and thinking.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not your problem if the world collapses, it\u0026rsquo;s the company\u0026rsquo;s problem if the company collapses. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis aims to relieve the audience\u0026rsquo;s work pressure and let them understand that life is not just about work, and they should learn to relax.\nThe company\u0026rsquo;s collapse is the company\u0026rsquo;s business, what does it have to do with me? \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nFurther emphasizing that work is not all of life, and there is no need to be overly anxious.\nThe withholding tax amount is enough to pay the taxes. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to withdraw money from your retirement account to pay taxes. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nAddressing the tax question raised by the audience, giving direct advice and stating that this situation should not occur.\nV.

Briefing Content # Market and Investment Philosophy # Market Situation and Personal Investment: Emphasized that even in the face of international events such as the Wol War and Trump\u0026rsquo;s election, personal investment decisions should not be changed as a result. These external factors are not directly related to long-term investment goals and should not be overemphasized, but rather focus on the execution of one\u0026rsquo;s own investment plan. Investing in the United States: Reaffirmed that the U.S. economy remains strong in the long term, so investing in the United States is still the right choice. Even if the world situation is turbulent, long-term confidence in the U.S. economy should not be shaken. Easy Investment: Advocated a simplified approach to investment, choosing to buy index funds and then reducing attention to short-term market fluctuations, sticking to a long-term hold. This \u0026ldquo;buy and hold\u0026rdquo; strategy can reduce anxiety and operational errors. Risk Warning: Emphasized the inherent risks of investing, especially the risks associated with leveraged funds and stock pledging. James strongly recommends that new students listen to several episodes of videos and be sure to carefully study the relevant handouts before making any investment operations, especially to understand the operating mechanisms and potential risks of leveraged funds and pledging. Non-Profit and Personal Experience Sharing: Re-emphasized that the CLAC channel, as a non-profit organization, does not charge students any fees and will not ask for remittances. All sharing on the channel is based on personal experience and is not professional investment advice. Therefore, students need to think, research, and bear all investment risks on their own. At the same time, students are reminded to beware of external fraudulent information impersonating CLEC. Market Volatility is Normal: Pointed out that market volatility is normal, with declines possible every year, 20% declines every three to five years, and 50% declines every ten to fifteen years. Investors should recognize that this is normal and not panic excessively, and they will get used to it by staying in the market long enough. Learning Resources and Tools # Learning Resources: Suggested that new friends start by watching past videos from 2023, and then go back to review content from 2022 and earlier. At the same time, emphasized the importance of the handouts provided on the message board, with relevant links available on YouTube and the Cross House message board. Community Resources: Introduced the Taiwan 00662 Endurance Group and thanked the group administrator for their selfless contribution. Students can ask questions within the group, and the administrator will do their best to answer them, but emphasized that the group mainly answers basic questions from the handouts, such as what is 442, what is pledging, etc., to avoid off-topic discussions unrelated to the investment theme within the group. The group may have regional restrictions, and users in Asia may find it easier to join. NASDAQ 100 Index Funds: Recommended investing in NASDAQ 100 index funds, and pointed out that there are related products in many places around the world, including the United States, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, etc. In Malaysia, it may be necessary to purchase through Phillip Securities. Best NASDAQ Document: Strongly recommended consulting the document titled \u0026ldquo;World\u0026rsquo;s Best NASDAQ United States NASDAQ 100 Index Fund Investment,\u0026rdquo; which contains information on NASDAQ funds and leveraged funds in various countries, with links on the message board. The document contains local information provided by friends from various regions, helping investors find suitable investment targets. YouTube Music Podcast: Detailed instructions on how to use the YouTube Music Podcast feature. Parts of the CLEC channel content can be transferred to YouTube Music, allowing you to enjoy ad-free listening and offline downloads, and guiding users on how to operate on mobile phones and web pages. Emphasized the difference between YouTube Music and a regular YouTube account, and that after joining a Podcast playlist, it will be displayed in the YouTube Music APP. Buffett Shareholder Letter: Emphasized the importance of reading the latest Buffett shareholder letter, especially the part about paying taxes. Shared a YouTube link and encouraged everyone to learn from Buffett\u0026rsquo;s investment wisdom and values. China NASDAQ 100 Index Fund: Introduced that there are already 12 NASDAQ 100 index funds in the Chinese market, and provided links to related ETFs to facilitate local purchases for Chinese investors. Even if there are purchase restrictions or premiums, these locally issued ETFs can be considered. Adlerian Purpose Theory: Strongly recommended watching videos related to Adlerian purpose theory as extracurricular homework to enhance happiness and self-awareness. Emphasized that understanding the purpose and meaning of life helps to maintain a peaceful state of mind in investing. Asset Allocation and Pledging # Asset Allocation Briefing: Mentioned the asset allocation briefing produced by Chen Feng and the 00662 group, mainly for investors participating in stock pledging, covering allocation schemes for different situations, such as different allocations with and without pledging (442, 80/20) and related Excel analysis tables. Recommended watching the relevant videos, and if you have any questions, you can ask them within the group. Stock Pledging Information: Shared information on stock pledging from E.SUN Securities, with the current interest rate at approximately 3%, which can be applied for online, and provided contact information for interested students to inquire. Leveraged Funds and Pledging: Re-emphasized that leveraged funds should not be used for pledging, and emphasized that U.S. leveraged funds should be placed in a retirement account (Roth IRA) and not pledged. Importance of Roth IRA: Emphasized that leveraged funds must be placed in a Roth IRA retirement account, rather than a Block 9 com account, to avoid unnecessary tax burdens and pledging risks. Rust IRA\u0026rsquo;s Importance: Pointed out that even if a Rust IRA account has little initial capital, it should be gradually increased to eventually achieve a 442 allocation. Emphasized the importance of time accumulation and the benefits of long-term compounding. Retirement Fund Withdrawal: Discussed fund withdrawal strategies when there is no income after retirement. Emphasized that in the case of non-pledging, in order to cope with market risks, only a conservative 80/20 allocation can be used to avoid over-reliance on leverage. Other Income After Retirement: If there are other sources of income after retirement, such as rental income or side hustle income, leveraged funds can be held, and a more aggressive 433 allocation can be considered, but a 442 allocation is not recommended. Pledging and Asset Allocation: Whether retired or not, as long as pledging is carried out, it is recommended to use a 433 allocation and cooperate with a smart rebalancing strategy. Yuanta Securities Pledging: Reminded friends who pledge stocks at Yuanta Securities in Taiwan to pay attention to the need to renew their contracts every 18 months to avoid forced sale of stocks. Even if there is no borrowing, timely renewal is still required. Investment Mentality and Insights # Individual Stocks and Index Funds: Emphasized the advantages of investing in index funds, pointing out that individual stocks are more volatile than index funds, and cited the stock price fluctuations of NVIDIA and Tesla as examples to illustrate that index funds can avoid affecting the mentality due to large rises and falls in individual stocks. Value of Long-Term Investment: Shared a case of a student who started investing in index funds in 2020 and earned eight figures by 2024, emphasizing the huge returns of long-term investment, which is better than short-term operations. Avoid Sub-Entrustment: Reminded to avoid investing through sub-entrustment to avoid increasing the complexity of tax filing due to excessive profits. Investment Philosophy and Market Cognition: Shared the transformation of a student from initial unfamiliarity with the market to ultimately understanding the concept of long-term investment, emphasizing that the highest realm of investment is to not pay attention to short-term returns, focus on long-term value, and achieve a selfless investment state. No Selling Principle: Emphasized the strategy of using stock pledges to borrow money to live on, the core of which is not to sell assets to achieve sustainable wealth. Criticized the idea of needing to sell assets for profit as short-sighted and a lack of financial knowledge. Channel Purpose: Re-emphasized that the goal of the CLEC channel is to help everyone achieve financial peace of mind and improve the quality of life. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Haoqing # Share 1: Shared the evolution of the tax system in the United States and views on the current government\u0026rsquo;s tax cut policy. James\u0026rsquo;s comment: Future tax reforms will not be retroactive, and existing Traditional IRAs will still be taxed. Even if the Trump administration does succeed in implementing large-scale tax cuts, tariff revenues will not be able to fully compensate for the reduction in individual income taxes. Question 1: The impact of the new U.S. government\u0026rsquo;s tax cut policy on investment? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: The world will not achieve a perfect tax-free state. Even if income tax is eliminated in the future, traditional retirement accounts (Traditional IRA) will still be taxed because the government needs alternative tax sources. Alternative tax sources such as tariffs may only be a transfer of the form of taxation, and the final tax burden may be comparable. The current retirement account investment strategy should not be adjusted based on future uncertain tax changes, but should be carried out according to the established plan. Even if there are adjustments in the future, there will be corresponding alternatives, so there is no need to worry too much. Don\u0026rsquo;t bet on something that may not happen in the future. Question 2: Views on the U.S. health insurance system and the impact of future tax systems and AI development on investment strategies? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: The U.S. health insurance system does have shortcomings, such as rejection of claims and delays, but health is very important and should not be sacrificed for the sake of saving money. Encourage everyone to have the ability to distinguish between minor and serious illnesses, and not to turn minor illnesses into major illnesses. Minor illnesses and pains can be observed on your own, but you must have the knowledge to judge major illnesses, and you must go to the hospital when necessary, and you cannot sacrifice your life in order to save money. Rich people can not rely on insurance and cover medical expenses through wealth. In the future, even if AI develops and the tax system changes, it will not have much impact on the current retirement account investment strategy, so there is no need to worry too much. Encourage looking at government taxation from a business perspective and understanding the logic of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. If a zero tax rate is really implemented, then consider how the government can increase revenue, such as selling gold card immigration. Summer # Question 1: A non-U.S. resident (NR) in mainland China, holding a U.S. dollar account, has purchased QQQM and QLD. Considering the risk of estate tax, wants to switch to EQQQ issued in Europe. Inquired about the reasons for the price difference between European and American market ETFs and suggestions for operation? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: It is strongly not recommended to open an account with a brokerage firm outside the United States because there is a risk of estate tax. It is recommended to close the U.S. account as soon as possible and consider opening an account with a Hong Kong brokerage firm to purchase NASDAQ index funds listed in Hong Kong, such as 7261 (double leverage), 7266 (Southern NASDAQ). Emphasized that it is also feasible to purchase U.S. dollar-denominated funds in Hong Kong. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t care about the U.S. situation. Question 2: Regarding the understanding of whether holding non-U.S.-issued ETFs in a U.S. brokerage account can avoid estate tax? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Estate tax is related to where the brokerage account is located, not where the ETF is issued. As long as you open an account with a U.S. brokerage firm and fill out the W-8BEN form, you are subject to U.S. estate tax. Even if you purchase ETFs issued outside the United States, you still need to pay estate tax. U.S. tax residents have estate tax, and if they need to fill out a W-8BEN, they have to pay estate tax. It is recommended to consult IBKR to confirm specific tax issues, or consider brokers in other regions such as Phillip Securities in Singapore to avoid U.S. estate tax. Brian # Share 1: Shared that he has been under a lot of work pressure recently and feels slightly depressed, but feels comforted when spending time with his children, and said that CLEC content has been helpful to him. James\u0026rsquo;s comment: Recommended watching videos related to Adlerian purpose theory, the focus should not only be on work, but should be shifted, work is not everything in life. Money will not bring happiness, it can only reduce worries and increase choices. The meaning of life lies in love and being loved, and success lies in how many people remember and love you after you pass away. Emphasized finding comfort in Lao Zhuang philosophy. It is common to run into walls at work, the important thing is to shift your focus away. Sophia # Question 1: Retired, using an 80/20 allocation, QQQ holdings are less than 80%, some funds are in cash, considering converting some QQQ to QLD for long-term holding, is it feasible? Some of the money wants to be left to her grandchildren. James\u0026rsquo;s reply: It is not recommended to transfer funds from a retirement account to QLD. QLD still needs to be converted back to QQQ in the end, which is suitable for young people or children\u0026rsquo;s accounts with a long-term tax-free period. If your child is 5 years old, and has a hundred or two dollars, it is no problem to buy QLD. For retirement accounts, just maintain an 80/20 allocation, and don\u0026rsquo;t pursue high risk. Emphasized that you must calculate clearly whether you can file your own taxes at age 18, and that children have $50,000 of long-term tax-free funds. For the money that is to be left to grandchildren, if the funds have reached more than 55 times the annual expenditure, the excess part can be considered to set up a custodial account for the grandchildren, and donate a certain amount each year, which can avoid estate tax and allow the grandchildren to get in touch with investment and financial management as early as possible. The key is that you must first be financially free. Shufen # Share 1: Shared the comparison between her mother\u0026rsquo;s hospitalization experience in Taiwan and her friend\u0026rsquo;s father\u0026rsquo;s experience in a nursing home in the United States, reflecting on Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s national health insurance and the U.S.养老体系 (pension system/care system), hesitant about where to spend the future, and not knowing where home is. James\u0026rsquo;s comment: The United States has a safety net of social security systems such as Medicare and Medicaid, which provide basic medical and pension security for low-income people, and the country will support those over 65 who have no money. Nursing home services in the United States are luxurious but expensive, while Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s national health insurance benefits are good but may not be luxurious. The choice of where to spend your time should take into account personal financial status, comfort of life, and relationships with relatives and friends. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have money, you can get Medicare. Emphasized that the meaning of life lies in connection, and encouraged young people to have children as early as possible to establish family connections. Wherever the children are, that is where the home is, and you should have children as soon as possible. Emphasized the importance of connections in old age, and encouraged having children even if you are not married. IAM # Question 1: Regarding wealth awakening, early earning goals are easy to achieve, but larger wealth goals create doubt, how to understand this change in mentality? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: After the early material desires are satisfied, a sense of emptiness will follow, and the happiness brought by material consumption is short-lived, and you should turn to spiritual consumption. The real happiness lies in having the ability to buy but choosing not to buy, and using money to improve your spiritual life, such as family gatherings, travel, etc. Material things should be reduced as much as possible. Wealth accumulation should look to the future and see the potential of long-term compounding. For example, the current 7 million assets may grow to hundreds of millions under long-term investment. You should not look at 7 million, but at 300 million. You see the present, he sees the future. Jimmy # Share 1: Supplemented the view on境界提升 (jingjie tisheng - elevation of one\u0026rsquo;s spiritual state), citing Zhuangzi philosophy, emphasizing the importance of mind state, and how to improve cognitive境界 (jingjie - realm/state) through practice. Emphasized the Tao Te Ching, and the view of all things in the world. James\u0026rsquo;s comment: Knowledge itself is simple, but it is not easy to improve cognitive境界 (jingjie - realm/state). Practice is the key to improving境界 (jingjie - realm/state), and encouraged everyone to try operations such as stock pledging, so that they can truly understand after experiencing it personally. IV.

Current Topic # This episode revolves around ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s analysis of CLEC Investment Education, deeply comparing CLEC investment with common investment education on the market, influencers, and common investment books. It emphasizes the uniqueness, practicality, executability, and systematic nature of CLEC investment. At the same time, James shares the growth path of investors, the necessity of asset allocation, the importance of cash flow management, and how to deal with market fluctuations, and answers questions raised by students regarding the A-share NASDAQ premium, the American political economy, and AI regulation.\nII. Briefing Content # Investment Philosophy and Strategy # Differences between CLEC Investment and Market Books, Influencers:\nCore Strategy: CLEC uses the NASDAQ 100 Index Fund (QQQ) as its core, combined with leveraged funds (QLD) and bank pledges for asset allocation, targeting an annualized return of 12%~20%. Traditional Investment Education: Usually only emphasizes large-cap index investing (such as VOO, SPY) or value investing, rarely mentions leveraged funds, and even less involves specific capital operation strategies (such as stock pledges). Influencer Finance: Often oversimplifies investing or recommends various immature investment targets (such as newly issued ETFs), lacking systematicity and risk control. Financial Freedom Strategy: CLEC provides a clear path to financial freedom, including when to start stock pledges, the amount that can be safely withdrawn each year, and how to achieve financial freedom through capital operations, rather than just \u0026ldquo;saving money + investing.\u0026rdquo; Practicality and Executability: CLEC provides concrete and actionable plans, such as how much assets you need to reach to start pledging, how to adjust asset allocation according to market conditions, while many books and courses only have theory and lack practical guidance. Capital Operation: CLEC emphasizes capital operation through bank credit, wealth management mortgages, stock pledges, etc., to achieve the goal of \u0026ldquo;borrowing money to invest, borrowing money to spend, and asset appreciation,\u0026rdquo; which is rarely involved in traditional investment education and influencer finance. Risk Management: Emphasizes risk control and has specific coping methods in the event of a downturn. Comparison with Common Investment Books:\n\u0026ldquo;The Psychology of Money\u0026rdquo;: Emphasizes long-term investing and saving, but CLEC goes a step further by accelerating wealth accumulation through leverage and capital operations. \u0026ldquo;A Random Walk Down Wall Street\u0026rdquo;: Advocates investing in the broad market index (SPY), but CLEC believes that QQQ has more growth potential and combines leveraged funds and cash for asset allocation. Buffett: Buffett is the representative of value investing, requiring in-depth research on companies and industries, while CLEC believes that ordinary people do not need to have professional knowledge and only need to invest in index funds. \u0026ldquo;Rich Dad, Poor Dad\u0026rdquo;: Focuses on real estate investment, while CLEC believes that stock investment and capital operations are more efficient and does not recommend investing in real estate. Investor Growth Process:\nBeginner Stage: Learn and practice long-term investing principles, and don\u0026rsquo;t panic and sell (already in the top 20% of the market). Advanced Stage: Learn and use leveraged funds and stock pledges (top 20% of the market). Advanced Stage: Proficient in stock pledges, cash flow management, and asset allocation, and fearless of market fluctuations (top 1% of the market). Core Investment Philosophy:\nMission: To awaken the capital awareness of ordinary people and help them achieve financial freedom, rather than for traffic and making money. Investment Target: Focus on investing in QQQ, believing in the long-term development of American technology. Leverage Use: Reasonably use leveraged funds (QLD) to magnify returns, but strictly control risk and avoid short-term operations. Smart Rebalancing: According to market ups and downs, dynamically adjust between QQQ and cash (or short-term bonds) to achieve \u0026ldquo;buy low and sell high.\u0026rdquo; Stock Pledge: Obtain cash flow through stock pledge to achieve \u0026ldquo;consuming without selling stocks\u0026rdquo; and ensure continuous asset appreciation. Simple and Effective: The investment strategy is simple and easy to understand, can be executed in the long term, does not require monitoring the market, and does not require stock picking. Asset Allocation and Risk Management # Importance of Asset Allocation:\nSurvival Guarantee: When the market fluctuates violently, reasonable asset allocation is the key to survival. Cash is King: Always maintain at least 20% of cash (or cash equivalents) to cope with emergencies and market declines. Dynamic Balance: Adjust between different asset classes according to market conditions to reduce risk and increase returns. Importance of Long-Term Investing:\nMarket Trends: Firmly believe that the market will move upwards in the long run and do not predict short-term fluctuations. Patient Holding: Investing requires time and patience, and wealth accumulation takes time. Emotional Control: Not affected by market sentiment and short-term information, and maintain an optimistic attitude. Risk Management:\nRisk Awareness: Recognize the high risk of investment and be mentally prepared for a possible drop of 50% or even 70%. Survival First: The primary goal of investing is to \u0026ldquo;stay alive\u0026rdquo; rather than pursuing short-term high returns. Cash Reserve: Adequate cash reserve is the most effective means to cope with risks. Smart Rebalancing: When the market falls, use cash to buy more QQQ or QLD to lower the average cost. Stock Pledge:\nCore Strategy: Obtain cash flow through stock pledge for living expenses or other investments to achieve \u0026ldquo;spending money without selling stocks.\u0026rdquo; Advantages: Avoid selling high-quality assets and enjoy the benefits of continuous asset appreciation; achieve the ideal state of \u0026ldquo;borrowing money forever, never repaying, and no interest.\u0026rdquo; Other # About Group Discussions: Focus on the Topic: Group discussions should revolve around CLEC investment philosophy and strategies, and not discuss content beyond the scope. Avoid Misleading: Do not discuss newly issued ETFs or other investment targets that do not conform to CLEC investment principles. Answer Questions: The group owner and senior students should help new students answer questions. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Eason # Sharing:\nA-share NASDAQ ETF Premium Issue: Elaborated in detail the fundamental reasons for the premium of domestic A-share NASDAQ ETFs (such as 513100, 159941, etc.): Foreign Exchange Control: China implements foreign exchange control, and each fund company has a state-approved quota. The quotas of old fund companies are usually tight, resulting in limited off-site subscriptions (suspension or limits), and investors can only turn to buying ETFs on the market, which pushes up on-site prices and forms a premium. Market Sentiment: The A-share market is easily affected by policies, hot spots, and other factors, and rapid capital flows can lead to violent fluctuations in the premium of the NASDAQ ETF. For example, when the market pursues other hot sectors, funds may withdraw from the NASDAQ ETF, leading to a decrease in the premium or even a discount. Long-Term Trends: In the long run, due to the existence of foreign exchange controls and investors\u0026rsquo; continued optimism about the NASDAQ, the premium will exist for a long time. However, in the short term, the premium will be affected by market sentiment and capital flows. On-site and Off-site Differences: The same fund has different codes and trading methods on-site (exchange-traded funds, ETFs) and off-site (subscribed and redeemed through the fund company). Off-site subscriptions are usually based on the fund\u0026rsquo;s net value, while on-site transaction prices are affected by supply and demand, which may result in premiums or discounts. Impact on Investors: The premium of the A-share NASDAQ ETF is unfavorable to ordinary investors, especially buying at a higher premium, which increases the investment cost. Investment Recommendations: Long-Term Investing: If it is a long-term investment, there is no need to worry too much about short-term premium fluctuations. Be Cautious When the Premium is Too High: When the premium is too high (such as exceeding 10%), you can wait appropriately or consider other investment channels. Pay Attention to Discount Opportunities: When a discount occurs, it is a good time to buy. Open an Account in Hong Kong: If conditions permit, you can consider opening an account in Hong Kong to directly purchase US stock QQQ, avoiding premium problems, and you can also allocate leveraged funds (QLD). James\u0026rsquo; Comments: Fully agrees with the doctor\u0026rsquo;s analysis that the premium problem of A-share NASDAQ ETF is indeed caused by factors such as foreign exchange controls and market sentiment. Suggests that investors who are more sensitive to premiums or want greater investment flexibility can consider opening an account in Hong Kong. Question 1: After Trump takes office again, will his domestic and foreign policies be very different from the past (including his first term), and will these changes shake the American system?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: American Strength: Clearly stated that the United States is very strong and Trump will make the United States stronger. Quality of Political Officials: American political officials are very good, they are loyal to the country, and can give up personal interests for national interests (for example, many political officials come from Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street investment banks, giving up high-paying positions). International Situation: Touched on international issues without commenting too much to avoid controversy. Ukraine Issue: Believes that the Ukraine issue was caused by Zelensky, who should be responsible for the current situation in Ukraine. Implies that Ukraine is being used by the United States. Summary: Overall optimistic about the United States and Trump\u0026rsquo;s policies, believing that the United States will continue to remain strong. Belle # Sharing: Learning Experience: Shared in detail her learning journey following James to learn CLEC investment for 4-5 years, from a \u0026ldquo;newbie\u0026rdquo; who knew nothing about investment to gradually understanding and practicing long-term investment, leveraged funds, stock pledges, asset allocation, and other concepts, and finally realizing a change in mentality and improvement in investment skills. ChatGPT Application: Introduced how she input the learning content and personal experience of CLEC investment into ChatGPT (version 4.0) and obtained ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s in-depth analysis and summary of CLEC investment. She found that ChatGPT can not only understand the core strategy of CLEC investment, but also analyze her psychological changes and decision-making logic in the investment process. Comparison with Other Investment Methods: In the learning process, Belle also read other investment books and influencer viewpoints, but she found that many investment methods are either too complex or too one-sided, lacking systematicity and operability. She believes that CLEC investment provides a complete, clear, and executable investment system, which makes her full of confidence in future financial freedom. James\u0026rsquo; Comments: Highly praised Belle\u0026rsquo;s learning achievements and summarizing ability, believing that her understanding of CLEC investment is very accurate. Expressed surprise and appreciation for ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s analysis results, believing that ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s understanding of CLEC investment even exceeded his own, which gave him a deeper understanding of the potential of AI. Affirmed Belle\u0026rsquo;s questioning skills.

Dave # Sharing: Responding to \u0026ldquo;National QQQ\u0026rdquo; Concerns: Some students worry that if everyone buys QQQ, will it lead to market imbalances or a decline in QQQ\u0026rsquo;s returns. Dave pointed out that this concern is unnecessary. Small Market Value of QQQ: He provided data, pointing out that the market value of QQQ (about $300 billion) is very small (about 0.5%) relative to the total market value of the entire US stock market (about $62 trillion), and even if more people buy QQQ, it will not have a big impact on the market. The Choice of a Few: Emphasized that CLEC investors are a minority, not a majority, and the vast majority of investors will still choose other investment methods. James\u0026rsquo; Comments: Fully agrees with Dave\u0026rsquo;s point of view, and reiterated that the market value of QQQ is very small and CLEC investors are a minority. Added that even if everyone comes to buy QQQ, there will be no problem because the market will automatically adjust.

Question: For investors in mainland China who cannot purchase leveraged funds (QLD), is it possible to keep investing in QQQ at regular intervals? Is this method feasible? James\u0026rsquo; Response: Completely Feasible: For investors in mainland China, since they cannot purchase leveraged funds, the following strategies can be adopted: Office Workers: Retain six months of emergency reserve funds (cash). Invest all remaining funds in A-share NASDAQ ETFs (such as 513100, 159941, etc.). Hold for the long term and invest regularly. Retirees: Adopt an 80/20 asset allocation (80% invested in A-share NASDAQ ETFs, 20% invested in cash or short-term bonds). Rebalance regularly. Advanced Strategies: Open an Account in Hong Kong: Suggests that after investing for a period of time (such as 3-5 years), if conditions permit, investors can consider opening an account in Hong Kong to directly purchase US stock QQQ and QLD and enjoy lower transaction fees and more flexible investment options. Gradual Transition: Gradually transfer A-share assets to a Hong Kong account to achieve a more optimized asset allocation. Additional Notes: Keep it simple when you first start investing * If the child\u0026rsquo;s account is not managed by him, you can invest in QLD Julie # Question: Worries about inflation and the Fed\u0026rsquo;s policies. Recently, US CPI data has risen, and the market is worried that the Fed will postpone interest rate cuts or even raise interest rates, which will negatively affect the stock market? James\u0026rsquo; Response: Relationship between Interest Rates and the Stock Market: No Obvious Correlation: Clearly pointed out that there is no obvious correlation between the 10-year US Treasury yield (TNX) and the trend of QQQ.

US Policies: Shared his views on US policies, believing that the United States is taking a series of measures to enhance its competitiveness. James\u0026rsquo; Comments: Reasons for the Premium: Market Differences: Premiums and discounts are normal phenomena between different markets, just like the price of the same commodity may be different in different stores. Capital Flows: The US market has more funds and institutional investors, and the demand for high-quality assets is higher, leading to price increases. Convenience: US investors are more inclined to buy familiar stocks in the local market, even if there is a premium. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s Financial Opening: Believes that whether Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s financial market is fully open has no direct relationship with TSMC\u0026rsquo;s premium in the United States. TSMC\u0026rsquo;s Strategy: Suggests that TSMC adopt a \u0026ldquo;cold treatment\u0026rdquo; strategy for the investment requirements of the United States and not easily give in.

Current Theme # This episode mainly discusses the following core themes:\nInvesting in Humanity for the Long Term: Emphasizing that the essence of investment is investing in the development of the entire human society, rather than short-term market fluctuations or individual company financial reports. Overcoming Human Weaknesses: Investors need to overcome human weaknesses such as fear and greed, and maintain extreme optimism and a long-term perspective. Importance of Asset Allocation: Recommend different asset allocation strategies for different age groups and financial situations, such as the 442, 433, or 80/20 principles. Avoiding Financial Scams: Exposing financial scams and insurance traps under the capitalist system, reminding investors to be vigilant. Cancel Insurance Early: Strongly recommend canceling all insurance policies, unless it is term life insurance for the family\u0026rsquo;s primary income earner with minor children. Sell Property Early: Suggest selling property and investing the funds in index funds for higher returns. Asset Pledging: Discussing how to obtain funds through asset pledging and use them for investment to improve overall returns. Attitude Towards Evangelists: Like Christian missionaries, convey investment ideas without forcing others to accept them. Importance of Cash: Asset allocation should include at least 20% cash. II. Briefing Content # 1. Investment Philosophy # Investing in Humanity\u0026rsquo;s Financial Reports: Instead of looking at individual company financial reports and short-term economic situations, focus on the development trend of the entire human race over thousands of years. Invest in indexes, looking at the performance of all of humanity. Investors Are Always Extremely Optimistic: Investment requires long-term optimism, believing that the market will eventually rise. Overcoming Human Nature, Looking at the Market with a Cold Eye: Investors must overcome human weaknesses and not be affected by short-term market fluctuations. Need to practice remaining calm in the face of a tiger, believing there is glass in front of you, believing there is a safety net, no matter how the market falls. Understanding the Demons and Monsters of Capitalism: Recognize financial scams, insurance traps, and the government\u0026rsquo;s wrong policies under the capitalist system, and avoid being exploited. Capitalism is efficient, but has side effects, coupled with financial industry scams, deception, and government collusion or wrong policies. Wealth is a Talent, and It Can Come True: The capitalist system allows everyone to have the opportunity to get rich, but requires correct knowledge and strategies. The education system is cultivating slave labor, while the financial industry is exploiting human weaknesses to sell fear. You can listen to Li Lu\u0026rsquo;s speech to understand the difference between investment and speculation. 2. Asset Allocation # Young People: Young people who are still working should directly invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ) and consider using leveraged funds to increase returns. Young people must increase returns, there is no other choice, try to buy leveraged funds. Retirees: Insufficient Assets: Take other strategies. Sufficient Assets: Choose different asset allocation strategies depending on whether there is stock pledging and whether there are other income sources. No Pledging, Need to Withdraw Money from Assets: 80/20 principle (80% index funds, 20% cash). With Pledging, No Need to Withdraw Money from Stock Assets: 442 principle (40% index funds, 40% leveraged funds, 20% cash). No Pledging, No Other Income: 433 principle. If there is no other income, and you need to withdraw money from assets, only 80/20. Have stock pledging, do not need to withdraw money from assets to use 442. Emergency Fund: Use 00864B as an emergency fund to cope with unexpected situations. About Loans: All loans must be able to be repaid from salary or stable cash flow. Try to pay off loans before retirement. If there is a mortgage that has not been paid off after retirement, part of the funds can be invested in high-dividend ETFs (such as 0056), and the dividends used to pay the mortgage interest, with the remaining funds used for investment. For example, borrow NT$10 million, with an interest rate of 2.78%, and no repayment is required for 20 years. The annual interest is NT$278,000, requiring NT$4.5 million to be placed in 0056, because 0056 has a 6% dividend yield, and the remaining NT$5.5 million is added to the 433 or 442 allocation. If there is also rental income, you can use 442. 3. Insurance # Strongly Recommend Canceling All Insurance: Most insurance policies are scams, exploiting human weaknesses to sell fear. Term Life Insurance: If you are the family\u0026rsquo;s primary income earner and have minor children, you can purchase term life insurance to protect the family\u0026rsquo;s financial security in the event of an accident. Only buy term life insurance that is purchased once a year, which is cheaper. If your assets reach 20-30 million, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to insure anymore. Funds from Redeeming Insurance: Invest in index funds to obtain higher returns. 4. Property # Not Recommended to Purchase Property: Houses are fixed assets, lack liquidity, and have high risks. Taichung Shin Kong Mitsukoshi will close down, and real estate will too. If you buy a house to live in for 60 years, and are forced to live in the same house for 60 years, that\u0026rsquo;s strange. Sell Property: Suggest selling property and investing the funds in index funds to obtain higher returns. Rich People Buy Houses: Only after becoming rich can you buy houses as casually as buying slippers. 5. Other # Convert Roth IRA: Don\u0026rsquo;t wait for the market to fall before converting to a Roth IRA, do what needs to be done as soon as possible. January 1st and 2nd may be the lowest points of this year. Overcoming Human Nature: In the face of market fluctuations, stay optimistic, eat well, sleep well, and have no worries. AI and Tech Development: The development of AI may promote exponential growth in U.S. stocks, with long-term returns expected. Longevity Risk: Need to consider the financial risks brought about by longevity and plan ahead. Need to plan to live to 120 years old. Children\u0026rsquo;s Education: The focus should be on letting children learn happily and explore life goals, not just to make money. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Xiaoxia # Question 1: The family income is divided between husband and wife. Is the 433 or 442 asset allocation based on the husband or the family income? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: It depends on each family\u0026rsquo;s situation. If it is centrally managed or centrally thought out, you can think in the thinking mode of the whole family, depending on whether you understand the financial situation of the whole family. If the husband is more conservative and mostly in cash, the wife can be more aggressive and buy leveraged funds to balance it. Question 2: My son is studying abroad, and the monthly expenses are NT$40,000. How should I include this in the expenses? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Treat this expense as a fixed deposit asset, deduct it directly from 00864B, and separate it from investment assets. This part will be spent this year and cannot be regarded as an investment asset. Transfer it directly to 00864B so that it will not be affected by market fluctuations for at least one year. Feida # Question: Currently holding 00662 and 00670L, allocated in an 80/20 ratio, and not withdrawing money from stock assets, do I need to adjust to 442? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: If you need money, you can consider using credit, and then use the extra money you borrowed to allocate to 442. Borrow money, buy stocks with NT$1 million borrowed, and put NT$1 million in cash. Switching to 442 immediately will increase your return through two-tenths of the cash. Ask how much you can borrow. If the bank dares to lend, don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid. Question: If gradually adjusting to 442, how to arrange the buying order? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Sell 00662 and convert to 00670L, as long as the total asset beta value is 1.2, the rate of return will remain unchanged. If you can take out a loan, take out the loan as soon as possible and adjust to 442 immediately. Hurry up and borrow, change it immediately. Grace # Question: Trump may carry out tax reform. Should I suspend converting to a Roth IRA? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Do what needs to be done first, don\u0026rsquo;t wait. Trump\u0026rsquo;s policies will not have a big impact in the short term, and you can change your strategy after he signs it. Trump has a lot of things to do, and the tax exemption for Social Security isn\u0026rsquo;t signed yet. Sara # Question 1: How did you come to the conclusion that you may live to 120 years old in the future? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Now technology is developing rapidly, many diseases can be treated, and parents\u0026rsquo; genes also have an impact, so living to 120 years old is expected. Question 2: How do you view the possibility of exponential growth in U.S. stocks after the AI breakout? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: U.S. stocks have always had exponential growth, and now because of AI, the annualized return may be higher in the future. It used to be 6%, then it jumped to 8% when the steam engine and electricity appeared, then it jumped to 12-14% when the Internet appeared, and now it may jump to 25% because of AI. Summer # Question: I bought an investment property in the Bay Area. Should I sell it now? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Sell it immediately. The later you wait, the greater the loss. Non-Americans who buy American houses pay very high taxes, and the estate tax is also very high, which is not cost-effective. If your child plans to study in the United States in the future, then wait until you need it. If you buy it, you will earn money in the future, and your taxes will be very high, and 1/3 will be taken away first. The asset estate tax is 40%, and the tax exemption is only 60,000. Jia # Question 1: Is it possible to borrow Japanese yen through Interactive Brokers to spend? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: It\u0026rsquo;s better to borrow Japanese yen to invest in U.S. stocks, just like Buffett, so there is no exchange rate risk. Just spend the money you can afford to spend now. Question 2: Is it worth it for a 15-year-old child to work at McDonald\u0026rsquo;s to open a Roth IRA? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: A 15-year-old child should study hard and live a happy life. Making money is not what they should be doing now. They should be taught how to manage money. Jenny # Question 1: If the bank wants to liquidate debts after asset pledging, will the stocks be sold? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The bank will not ask you to repay the money. The debt can be divided. The heirs inherit the assets and inherit the debts at the same time. Putting the account in a trust can also avoid a certification. After putting it in the trust, you can save on probate, just follow the trust. Trust just avoids probation. Question 2: Recent retirees have property and savings. Do they need to open a Rollover IRA? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: If they refuse to sell the property, there is no way to help them with financial planning. Sell the property, put it in a brokerage account, and live on 80/20 borrowing is fine. Question 3: Children\u0026rsquo;s company stocks are doing well. Should they be sold to buy QQQ? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: If you sell employee stocks now and earn 50,000 tax-free, you can slowly transfer them; otherwise, exchange for QQQ when you have income. Question 4: How can I get the kids to take the money they earn to buy QQQ? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This guy is already addicted to drugs, it\u0026rsquo;s very difficult to quit. Encourage him to invest more money, match as much as you can in the brokerage account, and see if they are willing to do what you say. You can encourage children to invest more money into the brokerage account. Max # Question: How to prevent elders in the countryside from being tempted by insurance agents and keep holding stocks? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Keep in touch, accompany him, and cheer him up. Join the group, and everyone can help him analyze and answer his questions. You can transfer the stocks to a Yuanta Securities pledging account, but don\u0026rsquo;t pledge them, so you can\u0026rsquo;t buy or sell them, and there is an emergency available amount. Tell him that it has been pledged and there is no cash. Christina # Question 1: How to open a Roth IRA account for a child who works part-time in high school? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Find Lisa to open an account, either online or in the office, and open an account in the child\u0026rsquo;s name. If you want to see the account online, you need to sign for power of attorney. Question 2: How to join Chen Feng and Naixin\u0026rsquo;s group? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: There is a link on the message board. You can only join with a LINE registered with a Taiwanese mobile phone number. You can also add Peter\u0026rsquo;s and the doctor\u0026rsquo;s WeChat. Shufen (Sharing) # Sharing: Because insurance was cancelled and entered QQQ (525), I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too worried even after the price dropped. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Thumbs up Grace (Sharing) # Sharing: After listening to James, I bought QQQ and have a large sum of money now. Now I\u0026rsquo;ve started asking my son to buy QQQ, and a masseuse who heard her sharing also wants to learn about investing. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Very happy to have helped more people. Chen Feng (Sharing) # Sharing: Relatives and friends have become interested in investing due to continuous persuasion. Investment itself is psychology, and if the 80/20 allocation doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, the mental account doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The 20% cash in asset allocation is very important, to preach, whether or not someone understands is their business. IV. Wonderful Views # Investors can only be extremely optimistic, there is no other way. Investors always influence the sunshine, the market will eventually rise, investment requires patience, and wealth is worth waiting for. \u0026ndash; James\nBackground: This is a summary of investor mentality, emphasizing the confidence and patience of long-term investment.\nThe world is unfair.

In some areas, houses may be difficult to sell due to insurance issues.\nCapitalism itself is a fair, just, and open system, but everyone is using this system to say things that are seemingly true. \u0026ndash; James\nBackground: Pointed out the problems of the capitalist system, which is that it is used by some people for financial scams and transfer of benefits.\nFinancial management is a scam to me, and insurance is also a scam. \u0026ndash; James\nBackground: He bluntly expressed his views on financial management products and insurance, believing that many of them use human weaknesses to commit fraud.\nIf you are tormented by the market for a long time, then you need to think about whether your position is too heavy? Or are you not suitable for investing at all? \u0026ndash; James\nBackground: Reminded investors that if they are affected by market fluctuations for a long time, they should reflect on whether their positions are too heavy, or whether they are suitable for investing.\nRedeem all insurance, and then unless your children are very small, buy term life insurance, which is to buy it once a year, buy one every year. \u0026ndash; James\nBackground: Re-emphasized the choice of insurance, and that term life insurance is only needed in special circumstances.\nV.

The Market Has No Lows, Only Highs: How to Escape Wrong Timing Strategies?","type":"posts"},{"content":" I. Current Theme # This CLEC episode focuses on asset allocation and accounting standards (ACC), explaining the relationships between assets, liabilities, and net worth, as well as the calculation and significance of ROA, ROE, and ROI. It emphasizes the importance of extreme optimism in investment, believing that the market will definitely break through new highs. Furthermore, James and the students delved into the latest developments in the AI field, particularly the potential impact of DeepSeek on the industry.\nII. Briefing Content # 1. Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth # Assets: Generally refer to all resources of economic value owned by an individual or household, including current assets (such as cash, deposits, stocks) and fixed assets (such as real estate, cars, collectibles). In everyday conversation, the \u0026ldquo;assets\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;wealth\u0026rdquo; people talk about usually refers to total assets. Liabilities: Refer to the debts owed by an individual or household, including short-term liabilities (such as credit card debt, consumer loans) and long-term liabilities (such as mortgages, car loans). Equity (Net Worth): The balance after deducting liabilities from assets, representing the true wealth owned by an individual or household. This is an important financial indicator that reflects the true financial situation. Formula: Net Worth = Assets - Liabilities Example: If you own a house worth 5 million, but still owe 3.5 million on the mortgage, then your net worth is 1.5 million (5 million - 3.5 million = 1.5 million). 2. ROA, ROE, ROI # ROE (Return on Equity): A metric that measures the efficiency of investing one\u0026rsquo;s own funds, reflecting the return generated by each unit of net worth. Formula: ROE = Net Profit / Net Worth Example: If your real estate net worth is 6 million (total price 15 million, loan 9 million), and the property appreciates by 500,000 in a year, then your ROE = 500,000 / 6 million = 8.33%. ROA (Return on Assets): A metric that measures the efficiency of total asset utilization, reflecting the return generated by each unit of total assets. Formula: ROA = Net Profit / Total Assets Example: If you invest 15 million in total assets (real estate) and earn 500,000 in a year, then ROA = 500,000 / 15 million ≈ 3.33%. ROI (Return on Investment): A metric that measures the benefit of a specific investment project, reflecting the return generated by each unit of investment. Formula: ROI = (Investment Gain - Investment Cost) / Investment Cost Special Case: If all assets are used for investment and there are no idle funds, then ROA ≈ ROI. 3. Stock Investment and Borrowing # Impact of Borrowing: If borrowing is used for stock investment (such as margin trading, credit loans, mortgages, etc.), then the return on equity (ROE) will increase significantly because you leverage a larger investment scale with less of your own capital. Example: If you have 15 million in stock assets, of which 9 million is borrowed and 6 million is your own capital. The stock investment yields a 14% return in one year (2.1 million). Then ROA = 2.1 million / 15 million = 14%, and ROE = 2.1 million / 6 million = 35%. Impact of Cash: To control risk, investors usually don\u0026rsquo;t invest all of their funds in the stock market and instead retain a portion of cash. This portion of cash reduces the overall return on investment. Beta: Beta \u0026lt; 1 indicates that the volatility of the investment portfolio is less than the overall market volatility, usually meaning holding cash or low-risk assets. Example: If you have total assets of 15 million, of which 2 million is cash and the actual stock investment is 13 million. If the stock return is still 14%, then the total return is 1.82 million (13 million * 14%). ROA = 1.82 million / 15 million ≈ 12.13%, ROI = 1.82 million / 13 million = 14%. ROI of Short-Term Operators: Short-term operators or options traders typically only invest a small amount of capital. The \u0026ldquo;return\u0026rdquo; they talk about is often ROI rather than ROE. For example, they may have 1 million in funds but only use 100,000 for options trading and earn 30,000. They may say their ROI is 30%. But in reality, their ROE is only 3% (30,000 / 1 million). 4. Investment Advice and Philosophy # Buffett\u0026rsquo;s View: Warren Buffett emphasizes that whether evaluating a business or a personal investment, one should focus on ROE (return on equity) rather than ROI (return on investment). ROE more truly reflects the efficiency of capital utilization and profitability. Independent Thinking: Don\u0026rsquo;t easily listen to other people\u0026rsquo;s investment advice. Develop your own investment system and judgment through self-study. Risk Awareness: If you are afraid of market declines and losses, then you may not be suitable for high-risk investments. Long-Term Investment: Invest in index funds such as QQQ and adhere to long-term holding without easily selling. Avoid Individual Stocks: For most investors, avoid investing in individual stocks because they are riskier and can easily lead to significant losses. Extreme Optimism: Maintain an optimistic attitude towards the market, believing that the market will move upward in the long run and continue to reach new highs. Retirees with Insufficient Funds can consider high-dividend ETFs (0056 or HSPHD) to increase cash flow. 5. Retirement Asset Allocation # Single Investment in QQQ: If only investing in QQQ (or 00662), one can withdraw 2% of assets annually as living expenses. QQQ + High-Dividend ETF: If 2% of living expenses is not enough, consider allocating a portion to high-dividend ETFs (such as 0056 or HSPHD). These ETFs may have a dividend yield of 4%-5%. For example: Invest 50% of the funds in QQQ and the other 50% in high-dividend ETFs (80% in 0056 + 20% in 00864B). Core Goal: The core goal of retirement planning is to obtain a stable cash flow rather than simply pursuing asset appreciation. 6. Emphasis # Learning: Encourage everyone to watch CLEC\u0026rsquo;s past videos, starting with 00451, to gradually understand investment philosophies and strategies. Communication: Welcome everyone to ask questions via email, but it is recommended to watch the videos first to build a basic foundation of knowledge. Optimism: Emphasize that investment should be extremely optimistic, believing in the long-term upward trend of the market. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Kate # Question 1: Previously, it was mentioned that investing in QQQ/00662 contributes to the capitalist market, but if you buy a 2x leveraged ETF, which is essentially deployed through futures, does it still contribute to society? Is the contribution the same? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: There is a contribution, and it is a double contribution. Because there are many ways to hold assets, you can choose to directly hold the underlying stock or use financing (borrowing money) to expand the investment scale. Some 2x leveraged ETFs achieve this through borrowing, while others use futures and other derivatives. Regardless of the method, it is putting capital into the market, supporting the operation and development of businesses. Capitalists contribute the most to society by investing and allocating resources to the most promising companies. Investing in an index fund like QQQ means allocating funds to the best companies on the market, supporting their innovation and development, and thereby creating value for all of humanity. Question 2: The student\u0026rsquo;s concern is that a large part of 2x leveraged ETFs consists of futures, and futures trading is perceived as a zero-sum game, where one party\u0026rsquo;s profit necessarily means another party\u0026rsquo;s loss. Would this contradict our previous emphasis on the concept of \u0026ldquo;contributing to society\u0026rdquo;? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: First of all, not all the funds in our investment portfolio have to be used for investment. We can keep a portion of cash. Secondly, futures trading can also be understood as a \u0026ldquo;pre-purchase,\u0026rdquo; similar to a \u0026ldquo;red slip\u0026rdquo; (pre-sale contract) when buying a house. You pay a deposit, locking in the future right to purchase, which provides financial support to the developer and promotes market liquidity. Futures trading is similar in that investors commit to buying or selling assets at a specific price at a future date, which provides liquidity and price discovery mechanisms to the market. Therefore, our investments, including the use of leveraged instruments, contribute to the market. Jenny # Share 1: Asset allocation of 433 and 442 should strictly follow the proportions of QQQ/QID/short-term bonds. In Taiwan, these are 00662, 00670L, and 00864B. Do not arbitrarily combine different targets, as this may deviate from our calculated expected returns and risks.\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Comment: If you have a mortgage or credit loan, it usually means you are still working. If you are retired, it is best not to have these loans, as this will increase your financial pressure. Retired people should not borrow credit loans and should pay off their mortgages. Net worth after retirement is the basis for calculating your retirement income (50 times your annual expenses). If you are still working, you can moderately use leverage (such as stock pledges), borrowing 2% of your stock assets for consumption while continuing to increase investment. As your assets increase, gradually adjust the proportion of borrowing and consumption. Also, remind everyone that if friends do not watch our investment tutorial videos, then do not advise them to invest, because investment requires doing your own homework and making decisions. Share 2: When combining your own investment targets, you must clearly understand the volatility of each target. We understand the characteristics of the QID or 00670L we recommend. If you combine them yourself and do not understand the volatility, you need to do your own simulation backtesting, otherwise the risk will be very high.\nQuestion 1: I currently have 1/4 of my assets under my adult child\u0026rsquo;s name, and I plan to retire in 3 years. Can this portion of assets under my child\u0026rsquo;s name be included in my retirement fund calculation?\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response: No, once you have given it to your children, it is their asset. If you can freely access their money, then of course it can be counted as your asset, but you have to consider the possible legal and family relationship issues in the future. I suggest you transfer the money back into your account first, and only consider giving it to them after you are truly retired and your assets exceed 50 times your annual expenses. Before retirement, it is not recommended to give money to your children; just give a small amount of lucky money. Question 2: If I include my child\u0026rsquo;s account, I can retire now; but if I don\u0026rsquo;t count this portion, my assets do not yet reach 50 times my annual expenses.\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response: If you want to retire, transfer the money back. Otherwise, there may be changes over time. After you retire, if your assets appreciate to more than you need, you can consider giving it to your children. At least this will ensure that your own retirement life is not affected. Question 3: I have invested in VOO and QQQ. When I see the market at a high point, should I sell first and buy back when it falls to a low point?\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response: Our investment strategy is to buy when we have money, hold for the long term, and not time the market. Question 4: I bought an annuity many years ago, investing 150,000, and now I can only receive a few hundred dollars back each month. This annuity expires next year. Should I redeem it and invest on my own?\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response: If you can hold for the long term without easily selling, then the return on an annuity is usually very low, and you can consider redeeming it. But the premise is that you can withstand market fluctuations, even if the market falls 80%, can you still persist in holding on? If so, then redeem the annuity and invest in index funds such as QQQ. Yami # Question 1: A friend recommended an ETF called GYLD, which is said to have a high interest rate with a yield of 10%-12%. I would like to ask the teacher\u0026rsquo;s opinion on this ETF. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This ETF has a high risk. It has fallen more than 50% from its high point. Do not easily listen to advice from people who do not understand investing. We invest in QQQ, and even if it falls, it will eventually rise back. But a Covered Call ETF like GYLD may never rise back up if it falls. Question 2: I would like to understand the specific operating mechanism of Covered Call ETFs. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This is more complicated, and I won\u0026rsquo;t explain it in detail here. In short, it is not recommended to invest in these types of ETFs. Danny # Question: Is long-term holding only suitable for index funds like QQQ? I used to buy some individual stocks, such as Chinese solar companies, and in the end, these companies disappeared. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Individual stocks are very risky; you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have bought them in the first place. Don\u0026rsquo;t buy individual stocks anymore. Just buy index funds like QQQ. Question 2: What is the difference between the QQQ and SPY index funds? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: There is a big difference. We do not recommend investing in SPY, especially for young people. SPY has a lower long-term return and is also more volatile. Question 3: After retirement, is the main source of income mortgaging stocks and borrowing money to use? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Yes, but the premise is that you fully understand our asset allocation and risk control strategies. Y5 # Question: I currently use a long-term holding strategy and put some ETFs into dividends to cover my living expenses. The rest are some bonds and value growth stocks. After listening to the teacher, I really want to convert some of these things into QQQ and leave the dividends behind. Is this good or bad? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: First, you need to determine whether you are retired, how much assets you have, and how much your annual expenses are. If you are retired and the dividend ETF is already enough to cover your living expenses, and you still have a surplus for investment, then you can continue to maintain this state. However if, you want to measure whether you have achieved financial freedom, for example: can you and your family travel to Europe and easily afford all the expenses? If you feel that your current state is very stable, very at ease, and you have enough tolerance for market fluctuations, then you can continue to maintain it. But, if the market declines, you may not be able to withstand it, so don\u0026rsquo;t change it easily. Suggestion: You can consider selling all your assets and buying 80% 00662 and 20% 00864B. Withdraw 2% of your assets annually as living expenses, and this completes the adjustment of asset allocation. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This method needs you to be able to bear it yourself. It takes time to adapt to a sudden change in investment methods. Si Wu # Question: I would like to invest my two children\u0026rsquo;s annual lucky money, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know what type of account I should open for them. Is it a regular brokerage account, an IRA account, or a Roth IRA? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: If the children are still young and have no income, then they cannot open a retirement account such as an IRA or Roth IRA. You can open a regular brokerage account for them, and you are the custodian of the account. You can set a deadline, such as when the children reach 22 or 24 years old, when the control of the account will be handed over to them. Until then, you manage the account entirely. If you withdraw money from the account, you need to pay capital gains tax. But our investment strategy is to hold for the long term without easily selling, so we usually don\u0026rsquo;t need to pay taxes. Only when you have no work income and need money do you consider borrowing from the investment account. Hao Qin # Share: I have been thinking about a problem recently. Assuming we invest in QQQ, after deducting inflation, the annual growth rate of actual purchasing power is about 10%. If a young person in the Bay Area has annual expenses of $120,000, how many years will it take to achieve financial freedom? If he saves $500 per month, calculated at a compound interest rate of 10%, it will take 46-47 years to accumulate more than 6 million. If he saves $1,000 per month, it will take 40 years. If he saves $3,000 per month, it will take 30 years. Like James retiring at the age of 42, if he only uses 20 years, then he must save at least $8,000 or more per month. Therefore, in addition to basic expenses, all the money that can be saved must be invested in the stock market to accumulate wealth as soon as possible. If income is not high, you can only exchange time for money. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Retirement is not that difficult. The key is to be stable and stick to it for 20 years. Young people should adopt a 442 asset allocation (40% QQQ, 40% QLD, 20% cash or short-term bonds), so that the beta coefficient is 1.2, and the annualized rate of return can reach about 17%. In this way, if you invest $3,000 per month, you can accumulate $6 million in 20 years. Therefore, young people must use leverage. A low rate of return is the biggest risk. Danny # Question: I have been studying with you for three years and have invested in QQQ/00662, 00864B, and 00670L, which I feel has been very helpful. I plan to retire in 4 and a half years. My current asset allocation is 721 (70% QQQ, 20% QLD, 10% cash), and the beta coefficient is 1.1. Should I adjust the beta coefficient to 1.2? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: If you are still working, you can adjust to 1.2. But be aware that 4 and a half years is relatively short. If the market falls sharply, your assets may shrink significantly, making it impossible for you to retire as planned. Also, you mentioned that your current assets are about the same as your mortgage. If you still have a mortgage to pay after retirement, then your retirement income may not be enough. Assuming you have to pay 50,000 per month for your mortgage, that\u0026rsquo;s 600,000 per year. Based on 50 times the retirement income calculation, you need to prepare 30 million to cover this expense. So, you need to carefully evaluate your assets, liabilities, and income after retirement before deciding whether to adjust your asset allocation. After retirement, leveraged funds should no longer be used. Chen Feng # Share 1: I would like to emphasize that whether we invest in prototype ETFs or leveraged ETFs, we are contributing to businesses and society. Even if you put money in the bank, the bank will use that money for investment. Including buying short-term bonds like 00864B provides capital to the government or businesses。 James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: There is a contribution, but the degree is different. Putting money in the bank means the bank is making the contribution, and your contribution is limited. Investing in QQQ supports technological progress and contributes more. Share 2: Recently, there has been a phenomenon in Taiwan where many people are borrowing heavily to invest through stock pledges or credit loans, even borrowing up to 60%. I\u0026rsquo;m very worried about this. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: We have always emphasized that borrowing for investment should not exceed 10% of total assets; otherwise, once the market falls sharply, there is a risk of liquidation. Mike # Share 1: About DeepSeek. The demand for AI will only continue to increase, and the demand for computing power has only just begun. The emergence of DeepSeek has shown some small companies opportunities. Some small software companies in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan have found new business models. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: DeepSeek is a driving force for AI development. It adopts a more underlying development method (assembly language) that lowers the barrier to AI development. This makes AI applications more popular, allowing more companies, even companies in the third world, to participate. Share 2: Musk has not commented on DeepSeek this time, but he may be doing it quietly. If there is no internet data, can AI continue to develop? This is a question worth considering. Also, some Taiwanese companies are starting to pay attention to edge computing, which is also influenced by DeepSeek. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Can AI replace existing industries? It\u0026rsquo;s not clear yet. It\u0026rsquo;s more about improving the efficiency of existing things. AI applications will become more and more common, but AI itself may not be a \u0026ldquo;paradigm shift.\u0026rdquo; In addition, AI may have an impact on search engines. People may use tools like ChatGPT more often instead of traditional search engines. Brian # Share: DeepSeek technical analysis. DeepSeek uses a more underlying technology (assembly language) to optimize data from open-source models such as Owen, LLaMA, and ChatGPT, reducing computing power requirements. The key question is how many H100 chips DeepSeek actually used. Too many, or failure to achieve expected results, could trigger market turbulence. DeepSeek may not be a technology transfer, but it is a new idea that prompts people to rethink the computing power requirements of AI and data center construction. DeepSeek may have used a specific dataset (math Olympiad question bank) when testing, which made its performance appear better.

Key Takeaways # Investors should always face the sunshine, and the market will definitely break through new highs. \u0026ndash; James\nJames repeatedly emphasized the importance of a long-term perspective in investment, believing in the long-term upward trend of the market and not being disturbed by short-term fluctuations. Only by remaining optimistic can one persist in the market and obtain long-term returns.\nCapitalists are the biggest contributors to society and the people who contribute the most to the world. We have made the most effective allocation of resources. \u0026ndash; James\nJames believes that capitalists, through investment, allocate resources to the most promising and efficient businesses, supporting innovation and development, thereby promoting the progress and prosperity of the entire society.\nLiving well is the most important thing. Don\u0026rsquo;t save on taxes. We often say that saving on taxes is very important, but when it comes to inheritance, it\u0026rsquo;s not your business, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. Inherit as much as you can, but it\u0026rsquo;s important to live well and with dignity. \u0026ndash; James\nJames, when answering questions about estate planning, emphasized that the quality of life for individuals during their lifetime is more important than the amount of inheritance. Don\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice your current quality of life in order to save on taxes or accumulate excessive wealth.\nNo investment is a life sentence. With investment, you usually get out in 30 years, 30 years at the latest. \u0026ndash; James\nJames encourages everyone to start investing as early as possible, even small amounts, as long as they persist in long-term investment, they can accumulate considerable wealth and eventually achieve financial freedom.\nYou want their interest, and they want your life. \u0026ndash; James\nJames, when commenting on high-yield Covered Call ETFs, reminds everyone to pay attention to the high risks behind high yields. Don\u0026rsquo;t be misled by high yields and ignore the potential loss of principal.\nHaving a house is being a rich poor person. It looks like you have a lot of assets, but you can\u0026rsquo;t spend them; you can\u0026rsquo;t spend freely. \u0026ndash; James\nJames believes that although real estate is an asset, it is illiquid and cannot be easily converted into cash, which may limit personal spending power and quality of life. Over-concentration on real estate investment may lead to the predicament of \u0026ldquo;having assets but no cash.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not that general companies that adapt to AI usually fail, because that cost will be beyond your imagination, and it will slow down your performance. \u0026ndash; Brian\nBrian pointed out, when discussing AI applications, that many companies may encounter problems such as high costs and reduced efficiency when trying to introduce AI. The application of AI technology is not easy and requires careful planning and implementation.\nWhy do you find that the Tesla Model 9 has been completely changed? The whole thing cannot be gradually changed from the old one, gone, retrained. \u0026ndash; Brian\nBrian mentioned that updates to Tesla\u0026rsquo;s self-driving system usually employ entirely new models rather than incrementally improving existing models. This illustrates that the iteration and development of AI technology may be leaping, and old technology may be quickly eliminated.\nTo achieve creation and thinking, you have to be better today than yesterday. How can anyone catch up with you that way? \u0026ndash; James\nJames emphasized that continuous learning and innovation are key to staying competitive. Whether in the field of investment.\nBuy with money, never sell no matter what \u0026ndash; James\nJames summarized that the best strategy for long-term investors is to choose quality assets (such as the QQQ index fund), hold them for the long term, don\u0026rsquo;t time the market, and don\u0026rsquo;t sell easily.\nV. Summary # This CLEC episode is rich in content, with both basic knowledge explanations on asset allocation and accounting standards and in-depth discussions on the latest developments in the AI field. James once again emphasized the importance of long-term investment and an optimistic mindset and reminded everyone to pay attention to investment risks and not blindly pursue high returns. At the same time, through interaction with students, he answered various questions encountered in actual investment and provided valuable advice.\nDisclaimer: This article is only a personal study note and does not constitute any investment advice.

Current Topic # This episode primarily shares the power of compound interest in long-term investing and discusses whether the 80/20 asset allocation strategy for retirees can be used for collateralization. James uses specific examples and data analysis to emphasize the importance of compound interest in long-term investing and the key issues to consider when using the 80/20 asset allocation for collateralization. For example, while it\u0026rsquo;s possible for retirees to use the 80/20 allocation for collateral, there are many restrictions. For safety, retirees should stick to the 433 allocation for collateralization.\nII. Briefing Content # 1. Program Suspension Notice and Disclaimer # Suspension Notice: Next Thursday (February 1, 2025) is the fourth day of the Chinese New Year. Considering that everyone may still be celebrating, there will be no program. The program will resume as usual on February 8, 2025. Disclaimer: All content shared on the CLEC channel is solely based on James\u0026rsquo;s personal experience. James is not a professional investment advisor and does not provide professional tax advice. Investing involves extremely high risk, so please be cautious. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that the possibility of your assets being halved (i.e., a 50% drop) can happen at any time. 2. Learning Materials and Viewing Recommendations # Learning Materials: Newcomers are advised to watch video 00451 first. We have also compiled a playlist of short videos. The subtitles for the \u0026ldquo;One Hundred Million Yuan Investment Lecture\u0026rdquo; series have been re-proofread, including English and various global language versions, making the translation more accurate. Viewing Recommendations: James advises everyone to watch the entire video, as the amount of information is large. Asking questions based on watching only parts of the video makes it difficult to get complete and comprehensive answers. About Groups: CLEC does not have any groups. The existing groups are organized by enthusiastic students, like the \u0026ldquo;00662\u0026rdquo; group. These groups mainly help new friends answer basic investment questions. However, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that these groups are not affiliated with CLEC, and James does not participate in any groups. 3. Investment Strategies and Precautions # Investment Target: CLEC focuses solely on investing in the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund. There are many instruments worldwide that allow direct investment in the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund, with relevant links provided in CLEC-related videos. For example, the ticker symbol for the Canadian 2x Leveraged Fund has changed. James will explain the specific changes in later videos. CLEC Video Quantity: Since 2018, CLEC has accumulated almost 1000 videos, covering content from investment basics to advanced levels. Investment Philosophy: Always maintain extreme optimism in investing and believe that the market will always go up. Prohibited Behaviors: We have a one-voice policy here. Activities unrelated to investing in the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund are not allowed. For example, recommending insurance, real estate, etc., is prohibited. 4. Supplementary Remarks on Chen Feng\u0026rsquo;s Sharing # About Chen Feng: Chen Feng is a senior and enthusiastic student who has voluntarily started a group and manages it with Nai Xin and others. Chen Feng\u0026rsquo;s Content: Recently, Chen Feng shared a three-hour condensed course on YouTube. James provided supplementary remarks on some of the issues: About Long-Term Annualized Returns: The long-term annualized returns mentioned by Chen Feng are the actual returns after deducting inflation. About Excel Demonstrations: In his sharing, Chen Feng used Excel spreadsheets to demonstrate the returns of different asset ratios. Students can check his Excel spreadsheets for more accurate data results. Chen Feng may also add supplements and corrections in the notes of his YouTube video. James\u0026rsquo;s Supplementary Explanation: Chen Feng\u0026rsquo;s sharing was for his group\u0026rsquo;s internal use. While these senior students have understood 99% of James\u0026rsquo;s content, there may still be some non-mainstream or less precise points. Therefore, James made a few supplementary explanations regarding his sharing. 5. Collateralized Borrowing and Spending Adjustment Strategies # Usable Funds Ratio for Collateralized Borrowing: The annual available funds for collateralized borrowing are 2% of retirement reserves (assuming your retirement reserves are 50 times your annual expenses). If your retirement reserves are NT$30 million, the annual available funds are NT$600,000 (NT$30 million * 2% = NT$600,000). This NT$600,000 is fixed. Even if the NT$30 million becomes NT$20 million due to market fluctuations, you can still use NT$600,000. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about a decrease in available funds because of market drop. Spending Strategy During Market Downturns: You do not need to reduce spending during a market downturn. You can increase spending during a market upswing. In other words, our annual spending will only increase, not decrease. Spending Adjustment Strategies: Upswing Scenario: For example, with a retirement reserve of NT$30 million, after 5 years, assets increase from NT$30 million to NT$50 million, and the net assets (after deducting debt, including 5 years of expenses, and annual interest, totaling NT$3.22 million) are NT$46.78 million (NT$50 million - NT$3.22 million = NT$46.78 million). At this point, annual available funds can be adjusted to NT$930,000 (NT$46.78 million * 2% = NT$930,000). However, this NT$930,000 includes interest expenses. Assuming the previous loan of NT$3.22 million and a 3% interest rate, the annual interest expense is about NT$100,000, and the actual available funds are NT$830,000 (NT$930,000 - NT$100,000 = NT$830,000). Downturn Scenario: There is no need to reduce spending during a market downturn. You can still maintain the peak spending level (e.g., if the peak spending was NT$900,000, you can still maintain NT$900,000 per year even if assets drop to NT$30 million). This allocation strategy is based on a model that assumes a 10-year decline from the peak, which can be fully sustained even under the extreme scenario of a 10-year decline. Core Principle for Spending Adjustments: Only increase spending, not decrease it, and it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to adjust it every 5 years to avoid frequent adjustments. 6. Retirement Asset Allocation and Collateralization Strategies # Retirees who do not utilize collateralization can use an 80/20 asset allocation, i.e., 80% invested in QQQ and 20% in cash. An 80/20 asset allocation, without collateralization, allows for simple rebalancing yearly without risk of bankruptcy. If you must utilize the 80/20 asset allocation for collateralization, please be aware: Absolutely do not use cash to rebalance in the market, cash must only increase, not decrease. Market downturns may last up to 10 years. If you borrow 2% annually, you will borrow more than 20% in 10 years. If you then invest cash, your total assets may be less than 20%. Therefore, using an 80/20 asset allocation for collateralization is high risk. A safer approach is still a 433 allocation. If you must use the 80/20 allocation for collateralization, rebalancing intelligently only during upswing years, that is, can only transfer cash from the prototype fund (QQQ), it is not allowed to transfer cash into QQQ during downswing years, can transfer cash into QQQ during upswing years. This approach is complex and requires simulation to ensure feasibility. 7. Core Principles for Asset Allocation # Whenever making an asset allocation or adjustment, assume that it\u0026rsquo;s the market\u0026rsquo;s highest point. Spending does not need to be reduced during a 10-year decline, as the allocation strategy has been verified through simulations as feasible. When assets have risen to a new high (e.g., from NT$30 million to NT$45 million), you can reset the spending amount. Even if the market declines again afterwards, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to reduce spending because it is already close to the bottom, and risk is reduced. 8. Yuanta Securities Finance Information # Yuanta Securities Finance is an institution that specializes in lending money out. Its interest rates are low (below 3%), and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t experience liquidity shortages like other brokerages or institutions. Its website operation and fund transfers are also convenient. 9. Risks of Real Estate Investment # Real estate is not a good asset and carries extremely high risks. Natural disasters like fires and earthquakes can cause the value of real estate to drop to zero. In some countries or regions, you still have to repay the loan even if the house is destroyed. Real estate involves putting all your eggs in one basket, and the risk is too concentrated. Moreover, real estate depreciates and loses value. Investments should be diversified. Avoid putting all your assets into real estate. You should only buy a house if you could afford to buy another one if the first one was destroyed. 10. Information on German Stock Pledge # See page 30 of the handout. This is information provided by students on German stock pledges. James did not provide a detailed interpretation. 11. Tax Issues of American Retirement Accounts (Traditional IRA \u0026amp; Roth IRA) # When the Traditional IRA becomes an inheritance, the heir must withdraw all the funds within 10 years. The principal and appreciation are both taxed, and there are almost no inheritance tax exemptions. When the Roth IRA becomes an inheritance, the heir has 10 years to withdraw the funds, and neither the principal nor the appreciation is taxed. Converting Traditional IRA to Roth IRA as soon as possible can effectively reduce the tax burden when RMD (Required Minimum Distribution) occurs. Many financial planners or accountants do not advise converting all your Traditional IRA to Roth IRA at once because they want to minimize your current year\u0026rsquo;s taxes, rather than focusing on long-term tax planning. 12. The Value of Life and the Meaning of Wealth # The value of life lies in learning, thinking, serving others, and growing, not just working and making money. Money is a tool to help us achieve our life\u0026rsquo;s purpose, enhancing our spiritual energy and fulfilling our dreams. The ideal state is to have 10 billion dollars in assets but owe the bank 10.1 billion dollars. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Angel # Sharing: Angel is a young man currently studying in the United States. He turns 21 the next day. His parents are very supportive and hardworking, allowing Angel to study in the U.S. without worry. Angel\u0026rsquo;s parents hope he can live a wealthy life, so they advised him to learn investment and financial management with James and promised to give him funds to invest. Question 1: If James were 21 again, with his current knowledge and parental support, how would he invest? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: If James were 21 again with his current knowledge and parental support, he would use a 442 allocation to buy in all at once. Additionally, the teacher shared two investment mistakes he made when he was young: investing in real estate, which he bought for 8 million and sold for only 6 million after 10 years, resulting in a significant loss; and selling company stock to buy a car. These two poor decisions resulted in his assets being reduced by half. The teacher used his own example to emphasize: $100,000 for a young person, with time, compounded at 14% annually, will be $25 million in 60 years; $10,000 for a young person is $2.6 million in the future, so young people should learn to save and invest first and then learn to spend money when the time is right. Question 2: Besides human nature, why is it not advisable for someone of my age to put all my money into QQQ, but rather 433 or 442? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Human nature is the most important factor that must be considered in investment. You cannot exclude the factor of \u0026ldquo;human nature\u0026rdquo;. If you don\u0026rsquo;t consider human nature, then don\u0026rsquo;t invest. For example, investors often overestimate their risk tolerance. Investment should avoid getting yourself into a state of extreme panic. Allocating all your assets to QQQ or half in QQQ and half in cash overestimates your risk tolerance. Although the market will eventually go up in the long term, your assets may fall to extremely low values during a market downswing, for example: from 100 to 80, 70, 60, then finally falling down to 5, 1. During this process, you might have already gone bankrupt and exited, even if you survive until market rise, it no longer has anything to do with you. It’s like playing Russian roulette: a revolver with 6 chambers, and 1 bullet. If the person firing doesn’t die, they will get 10 million; if they do die, they die. You should not participate because of the high reward. You could die. So young people\u0026rsquo;s beta should not exceed 1.2. Lisa # Sharing 1: Has retired and currently uses a power account as a reserve for daily living. The account balance is usually 0. Money is only used when a large expense happens or an emergency occurs. This practice brings her peace of mind. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to keep a lot of cash in her daily account so that she could effectively use cash for investment purposes. Question 1: After retiring, I do not want to use leveraged funds (like QLD), but I am worried about a stock market crash. Is it feasible to use the 80/20 (80% in QQQ and 20% in cash) asset allocation strategy? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Yes, it is feasible. An 80/20 asset allocation, if you don\u0026rsquo;t do collateralization, can do simple rebalancing yearly. Because she is retired, and the funds in her collateralization account have not been used, which is equivalent to her not using collateralization, she can use the 80/20 asset allocation strategy under that circumstance. Sharing 2: Has started Roth IRA conversion and plans to complete all the conversion within the next few years when the tax rate is lower. Question 2: Some people suggested using up the 32% tax rate, but I cannot mentally accept it, as it may mean paying higher taxes. Is it okay to just use up the 24% tax rate and deal with the rest during RMD time? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: You can complete all the conversions before the RMD age, as long as you finish before RMD, as money cannot be transferred into a Roth IRA after RMD age. Money can only be transferred into a brokerage account, which is not beneficial to inheritance. It is recommended to transfer the funds from the retirement account to a Roth IRA as much as possible, as the Roth IRA\u0026rsquo;s heir does not need to pay taxes within 10 years, while the Traditional IRA\u0026rsquo;s heir needs to pay taxes. Converting early can avoid higher taxes in the future. If you still do the conversion when the market drops, it means your conversion decision is correct. Although you may have to pay as high as 30% tax now during conversion, you can avoid higher taxes in the future in the long run (because your assets will grow significantly over time, so you will have to pay more taxes later). YJ # Sharing 1: YJ would first like to thank James and the \u0026ldquo;00662\u0026rdquo; group, especially for Chen Feng\u0026rsquo;s sharing and James\u0026rsquo;s supplementation, which make everyone\u0026rsquo;s investment concepts clearer. Sharing 2: The Chinese concept of \u0026ldquo;having land is having wealth\u0026rdquo; needs to be updated. In the current era, this \u0026ldquo;land\u0026rdquo; should not be real estate but rather \u0026ldquo;stocks\u0026rdquo;. The old concept of \u0026ldquo;having land is having wealth\u0026rdquo; refers to farmland that can be cultivated and has output, which is similar concept to current day investing in stocks. Suggestion: There are no more lectures on the 100 Million Investment topic this year. The 9 situations in the 00005 topic have been simplified into 2 situations. Can there be a \u0026ldquo;00006\u0026rdquo; topic, specifically on the \u0026ldquo;collateralization\u0026rdquo; part, with a simpler presentation? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: \u0026ldquo;Having land is having wealth\u0026rdquo; did not refer to houses in the past, as houses were not valuable in those eras and this term referred to farmlands. Today\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;having land is having wealth\u0026rdquo; should be changed to \u0026ldquo;having stocks is having wealth\u0026rdquo;, stocks are the true assets. Regarding your suggestion of topic 00006, James believes the existing sharing is already simplified enough. Users using collateralization should use the 433 allocation and make \u0026ldquo;smart rebalancing\u0026rdquo; using 2% of their assets yearly, and there is no need for a more complicated topical presentation. Question 1: Previously, I sent a message on YouTube mentioning the video 00303 in March 2022, and you suggested to not use TQ (TQQQ) back then. However, two months ago (around November), you replied that a 6TQQ+2U+2Cash strategy can be used with a 6:2:2 allocation. Does this strategy and comparison with the 442 strategy feasible? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: TQQ can be used. The suggestion in previous videos was based on the understanding at the time, so single-asset investment in TQQ was not recommended. However, now, if you have an asset allocation (like 6:2:2, which is 60% in TQQ, 20% in U, and 20% in Cash) and do \u0026ldquo;smart rebalancing\u0026rdquo;, this strategy is viable. Investment strategies and concepts are constantly evolving and improving. Ideas considered impossible in the past may now be proven to be feasible. Bill # Question: I previously learned about BOXX as an investment target that is not correlated to the stock market. However, I learned that it\u0026rsquo;s related to blockchain, so there are concerns about its safety, and whether its risk is too high? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: BOXX\u0026rsquo;s operating mechanism is similar to 00864B. As long as its return is trending similarly to the US Federal Funds Rate, its risk is controllable. You should pay serious attention when the return is much higher or lower than the US Federal Funds Rate, as it may indicate some irregular financial operations. BOXX\u0026rsquo;s primary function is to reasonably avoid investment income tax, and it can be used as a short-term investment target. Henry # Question: Henry runs his own business and used to have a company 401K. He has stopped it now, and he is not sure whether he should continue contributing into it or put the money designated for company contributions into his investment account. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The main purpose of a 401K is to save on taxes. If you can do a Roth Solo 401k, you should prioritize it. You can consult your tax consultant or search the web and consult ChatGPT to confirm if you can do a Roth Solo 401k. Yuqiao # Question: I am retired and have benefited from this investment method. I want to recommend this investment method to my younger sister in China (who is 50 years old, runs a small business, has a tight budget, and has almost no knowledge of investment). Should I give her investment advice? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Yes, you should. You can be her benefactor. However, she may not accept advice directly. Furthermore, opening an account and the follow-up operations are complex. So, if you really want to help her, you can open an account for her first and invest a small amount of money (such as $1,000 USD for about ¥7,000 to ¥8,000 RMB), tell her that if there are losses, you will bear it, if there are profits, it\u0026rsquo;s hers. You can also co-invest with her proportionally, for example, if she invests ¥100, you can invest ¥100 for her. Once she sees a return, she will then invest automatically. IAM # Sharing 1: IAM has recently met a doctor in his 70s. When he was young in his 30s, he trusted brokers and made careless investments. After several failed investments, he not only had real estate and stocks but was also in debt at 40 years old. He had to work to repay his debts even in his 70s. IAM is very grateful he found CLEC in 2022 and avoided going down the same path as the doctor. Question 1: James often says \u0026ldquo;slow is fast,\u0026rdquo; and investment should not be rushed. However, everyone\u0026rsquo;s understanding of \u0026ldquo;fast\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;slow\u0026rdquo; is different. Can you please explain how to measure \u0026ldquo;fast\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;slow\u0026rdquo; in investing and how to view the concept of \u0026ldquo;40 years is too long\u0026rdquo;? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Everything has its own rules and timings, like pregnancy and childbirth, which takes ten months and cannot be shortened. The same applies to investing. Wealth growth takes time. You cannot expect to harvest tomorrow what you planted today. It takes 10 years of investment to feel wealthy, 20 years to retire, 30 years to be prosperous, and 40 years to become rich. This requires time, one cannot be hasty. Warren Buffett did not become the world\u0026rsquo;s richest man at 30 or 40, but after 55 years old. Investing requires understanding the essence and rules of time. Do not be impatient. Every thing operates following its rules and timings. It\u0026rsquo;s a rule of nature and cannot be rushed. Question 2: Why do people haggle over small amounts of money, but at the same time act recklessly like gamblers when it comes to investing? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This all stems from humanity\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;loss aversion\u0026rdquo; mentality. People do not like to lose, so they haggle over prices when shopping, but they tend to focus only on the gains and ignore the risks when investing. During investment, people often forget past losses and only think about making more money in the future. This is the gambler\u0026rsquo;s mentality. When shopping, people compare prices since they can lose less and, by nature, they will haggle. In investing, people think that the more they invest, the more they will earn; while ignoring the possibility of losses, hence they will not haggle. It\u0026rsquo;s like if you go to buy a cake, and the owner says the cake is 100, you might haggle and say can it be 90? But if the owner says you buy my cake and tomorrow I\u0026rsquo;ll return 300, you won\u0026rsquo;t haggle anymore, you\u0026rsquo;d think the more expensive, the better. Mike # Sharing 1: Shared a story about a CNBC interview with Buffett and Bill Gates: If Buffett and Bill Gates went to McDonald\u0026rsquo;s and they see 1 cent on the ground, what would they do? Buffett would pick it up without hesitation and check if there are any other coins around; and Bill Gates would also pick up that cent. This story illustrates the principles of \u0026ldquo;every little bit counts\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;compound interest.\u0026rdquo; Even the wealthy do not overlook the importance of \u0026ldquo;saving\u0026rdquo; because when Mike was on a business trip to Microsoft in 1992, Microsoft was already a listed company, and Bill Gates was already very wealthy at that time. One of the employees criticized Bill Gates for using coupons when shopping for groceries. Later, one time, Bill Gates was looking for his coupon when checking out. The person behind him said, don\u0026rsquo;t worry, I will pay, you earn more than this in one minute. However, Bill Gates did not ignore the person behind him, he continued to search for his coupon. Sharing 2: Opinions regarding Deep Seek: Recently, AI technology is developing rapidly, with various new technologies and applications emerging, including Deep Seek, which will have a significant impact on QQQ\u0026rsquo;s future. Currently, American technology giants seem to have a \u0026ldquo;big brother\u0026rdquo; mentality, believing that they can win the AI race as long as they invest enough resources. However, historical experience shows that technological leadership does not necessarily win the market, the business model is also important. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Deep Seek, like many other AI technologies, is still in the early stages, and there will be many uncertainties in the future. But what is certain is that AI will have a profound impact on human society and bring huge opportunities for investors. Regarding the competition between the US and China in the field of AI, it is still difficult to judge who will ultimately win. The US has advantages in technology and funds, but China also has its own advantages, such as large amounts of data and government support. AI is not only large language models (LLM), there are many other applications, for example: Tesla\u0026rsquo;s autonomous driving. Tesla\u0026rsquo;s autonomous driving model is already very mature, it can automatically drive out from the parking lot and the driving experience is very smooth, just like a professional driver is driving for you. AI will not completely replace human jobs but increase our work efficiency. For example, even for translators, you can use AI to improve the efficiency and quality of translation. Therefore, humans need to learn how to utilize AI, not reject it. Currently, the biggest problem is that many large companies want to introduce AI, but they do not have a clear idea, they do not know whether it needs to be from top down or from bottom-up. James thinks it needs to be from bottom-up, the employees should use them first, so they are accustomed before moving up. But this requires time and because everyone is changing the thinking process of using AI. AI will cause QQQ\u0026rsquo;s annual returns to be much higher than 14%, or even 20% or 30%. James is very optimistic about this. Eric # Sharing: Based in Canada, 35 years old, plans to sell his house and invest the proceeds from the sale. Both he and his wife are currently working. Question 1: A plan to invest 20% in cash, 40% in QLD, 40% in QQ for long term investment and do smart rebalancing, is this investment plan correct? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The plan is correct. Young people who are still working can use a 442 asset allocation, which is 40% in QQQ, 40% in QLD, and 20% in cash, and then do smart rebalancing. Question 2: Canada has high taxes, and capital gains tax is heavy. What are your suggestions for long-term planning? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: People\u0026rsquo;s destiny is controlled by three factors: the first is fate (DNA); the second is destiny (place of birth); and the third is luck. The place of birth determines one\u0026rsquo;s destiny. Canada, Europe, and Australia are not as good as the US. If financially possible, consider immigrating to the US, not just for yourself but also for your descendants. Hao Qing # Sharing 1: Event 1: Shared two experiences of encountering potential \u0026ldquo;scams\u0026rdquo;. One time was meeting someone on a highway who claimed to be from Dubai, needing help. This person was dressed neatly, drove a BMW, and claimed to have run out of gas and had no money or was robbed. This person wore gold and asked Hao Qing for help, claiming that he could give his gold to Hao Qing. Hao Qing gave him 40 yuan, but he wanted more. Hao Qing felt that something was wrong, and so did not give any more. The second time, he encountered the same person on the road again, so he called the police. Event 2: A colleague\u0026rsquo;s relative, an 80-year-old, was scammed for 600,000 yuan. This old person did not believe what nearby people said about it being a scam, and believed that since he raised his children for so many years, it was not unfilial to ask them for money to invest and everyone was stopping him. When going to the bank, the bank employees also told him that it was a scam. The police also came to give him risk warnings that the money could not be transferred, but this old person still did not believe it and was scammed for 600,000 yuan. Personal Views: Hao Qing thinks that he is a kind-hearted person. When he sees someone in trouble, he will help to the best of his ability. However, he will be more careful when it comes to money. Also, there are now many scams and the success rate for solving them is extremely low. He is not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s the government\u0026rsquo;s problem or individual\u0026rsquo;s problem. Sharing 2: While discussing \u0026ldquo;US-China trade\u0026rdquo; with colleagues, his colleagues think that China may devalue the renminbi to deal with the US tariffs. He does not agree with this point of view but does not know how to explain it. Questions: How should we view the three problems of \u0026ldquo;scams\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Taiwan policy\u0026rdquo;, and “RMB devaluation”? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: About Scams: The US does not care because the US thinks that if you are scammed, it means you are stupid. Furthermore, the person that Hao Qing encountered is technically not breaking a legal law, even if you report, it is useless. All the police can do is to chase him away. Why are there scams? It\u0026rsquo;s because of \u0026ldquo;poverty\u0026rdquo;. When it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to earn money through normal ways, \u0026ldquo;scamming\u0026rdquo; becomes a way to get rich quickly. So, you still need to start from the systems, and education aspect. About Taiwan policies: The US has completely free capitalism where the market determines prices. When prices increase, wages increase, which will then increase interest rates and suppress inflation, ultimately creating a positive economic cycle. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s policies, to a certain degree, hinders this positive economic cycle. Regarding the RMB devaluation expectations: This problem is complex and interlinked. It cannot be simply solved via devaluation. Martin # Sharing: Previously talked with James about the DPC open-source model, and he is also involved in the implementation of his company\u0026rsquo;s AI project. Therefore, he would like to share and communicate with everyone. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Okay, you can come and share it with us next time. IV. Key Insights # When investing, you need to see results. You want to see results like Buffett\u0026rsquo;s. Of course, everyone\u0026rsquo;s level is different. When you feel you are living a prosperous life, you will also need 40 years. You cannot be hasty. \u0026ndash; James\nThis point explains the importance of \u0026ldquo;time\u0026rdquo; and the power of \u0026ldquo;compound interest\u0026rdquo; in long-term investing.\nThe value of life lies in learning, thinking, serving others, and growing, not just working and making money. \u0026ndash; James\nThis point emphasizes that the meaning of life lies in continuous learning, growth, and serving society, not just the pursuit of material wealth.\nYou also need an appropriate amount of time to grow wealth to a certain extent. Therefore, you need to recognize that time exists first. \u0026ndash; James\nThis emphasizes that wealth accumulation requires time and patience, and one should not take any shortcuts.\nWhat do you do when everything is destroyed? You need a way out. \u0026ndash; James\nWhether you\u0026rsquo;re investing or doing anything else, you have to consider if this thing fails, and whether you have a way out. Or whether you can bear the losses caused by that failure.\nToday if you buy a Tesla car but you\u0026rsquo;re afraid of it getting scratched, you\u0026rsquo;re afraid of washing it. After washing it, you\u0026rsquo;re afraid to drive it. Every time you drive it out, you\u0026rsquo;re afraid of people wanting to borrow it, or when your daughter wants to borrow it, you\u0026rsquo;d always say no and no. You\u0026rsquo;re a slave to wealth. It\u0026rsquo;s okay to drive. I have insurance. If it is crashed I can buy a new one. This is wealth. Therefore, don\u0026rsquo;t be a slave to your assets, never be. It\u0026rsquo;s better not to buy it, instead of buying it and then using up your mental energy over it. We should not spend any mental energy on material things. This is very important. This is the key to happiness. \u0026ndash; James\nWe should not be slaves to \u0026ldquo;wealth,\u0026rdquo; and should not be controlled by \u0026ldquo;material things.\u0026rdquo; If something affects your mood, do not buy it because you cannot afford it.\nPeople\u0026rsquo;s destiny is controlled by three factors: The first is fate (DNA); the second is destiny (place of birth); and the third is luck. \u0026ndash; James\nThe place of birth determines destiny. If you are born in the United States, you have the American destiny; if you are born in Taiwan, you have the Taiwan destiny; if you are born in Australia, you have the Australian destiny.\nI am still going to tell everyone that we are going to be very wealthy, so when you want to immigrate you have to think twice. If it\u0026rsquo;s me, I\u0026rsquo;d rather spend 800,000 USD to immigrate to the US instead of using less money to immigrate to Canada, Europe, or the NSW. Because the destinies are different. Look at the world\u0026rsquo;s top ten companies, and nine are from the US. Only one is TSMC from China, but TSMC is also cultivated in the US. To say it bluntly, all the world\u0026rsquo;s top ten companies were founded by Americans, this is fate. \u0026ndash; James\nWhen considering immigration, one should think not only for themselves but also the fate of future generations.\nAn 80/20 allocation without collateralization can do simple rebalancing yearly without risk of bankruptcy. \u0026ndash; James\nRetirees that do not do collateralization may utilize an 80/20 asset allocation where 80% is invested in QQQ and 20% is kept in cash, and can do simple rebalancing without risk of bankruptcy.\nThe US does not care about scams, they don\u0026rsquo;t even care about the 0-dollar purchase scams, so why would they care about scams? Therefore, there is a cost accounting issue. If a country wants to be strong, it needs strong cost accounting. What do you want? Right and wrong is about competing, and everyone needs to know that prosperity is a key, and poverty is a disease. Being poor for an emerging country is a disease, if one is poor it\u0026rsquo;s a disease. \u0026ndash; James\nThe United States is strong due to its sound system and market economy.\nAlways maintain extreme optimism in investing and believe that the market will always go up. \u0026ndash; James\nMaintain an optimistic attitude throughout the investment process.\nAI may not necessarily solely rely on computing power. It can also rely on the human brain. \u0026ndash; James\nThis point explains that in the development of AI, in addition to computing power, the human brain can also play an important role.\nV. Summary # This episode mainly focused on discussions surrounding compound interest, asset allocation, and various social phenomena. James emphasized the power of \u0026ldquo;compound interest\u0026rdquo; and the importance of \u0026ldquo;time\u0026rdquo; in long-term investing. He also provided detailed answers and specific operational suggestions regarding asset allocation strategies for retirees, particularly addressing the question of whether an 80/20 allocation is suitable for collateralization. Furthermore, he incorporated current events to share his perspectives on social phenomena such as US-China trade, AI development, and scams, pointing out that \u0026ldquo;wealth\u0026rdquo; is a key factor in a nation\u0026rsquo;s strength. Overall, this episode was packed with information, offering specific guidance on investment strategies along with profound reflections on life, wealth, and social issues, making it worthy of repeated study.\nDisclaimer: This article is solely for personal study notes and does not constitute any investment advice.

Episode Theme # The main theme of this episode is that investing in US indices means holding US assets, not holding US dollars. The discussion revolves around the US balance sheet, the relationship between the US dollar and US stocks, and deeply explores the philosophy of long-term investment and methods of asset allocation. In addition, it shares the impact of AI development on future work, social structures, retirement planning, and national competition, emphasizing the importance of learning and cognition, and asset allocation and balance.\nII. Briefing Contents # Market Volatility and Long-Term Investing # Market Volatility Is Irrelevant to Long-Term Investors: Short-term market fluctuations are normal. Long-term investors should adhere to the principle of \u0026ldquo;buy when you have money, hold long term, and never sell,\u0026rdquo; and not be swayed by market sentiment. Utilize the power of compound interest to hold quality assets for the long term. For example, even if the market experiences a significant pullback, as long as you hold a Nasdaq 100 index fund for the long term, you will ultimately achieve substantial returns.

Please be wary of any investment schemes online that claim to guarantee returns, especially those using celebrity endorsements or AI-synthesized voiceovers; many are scams. COEC does not charge anyone a fee nor does it recommend any paid investment services. Investment Risk Warning: Investing involves risk, and the stock market is highly volatile. Investors should be fully aware of investment risks. For example, investing in stock index funds such as QQQ may face a short-term loss of 50% or even more of their market value. Learning and Cognition # Investing Requires Continuous Learning: James emphasizes the importance of learning and encourages everyone to watch the value investing lecture series videos, recommending episodes 00451, 00398, and 00288. There are also condensed short films in the playlist to help everyone quickly grasp the core content and to share with friends and family. Only through continuous learning can we enhance our investment knowledge and judgment. Q\u0026amp;A Only Refines Your Existing Knowledge, Not Establishes It: This means that the Q\u0026amp;A session can only help you further understand what you have already learned, but cannot replace systematic study. For example, concerning how to specifically implement the 433 asset allocation strategy, you need to first watch relevant videos for a systematic understanding. Nasdaq 100 Index Funds: James recommends long-term investment in Nasdaq 100 index funds (such as QQQ and TQQQ) and provides a list of Nasdaq 100 index fund options around the world for investors in different regions to reference. Investor Optimism: Despite market fluctuations and uncertainties, investors should maintain an extremely optimistic mindset. Market declines should be seen as opportunities to buy quality assets at lower prices. In the long run, the economy and the stock market will always trend upwards. Wealth Growth Requires Time: Investing is a long-term process. Wealth growth needs time to realize the effects of compound interest. For example, by investing in a Nasdaq 100 index fund for the long term, waiting for ten or twenty years, assets could potentially grow to a scale of hundreds of millions. Advantages of Long-Term Investing: Compound Interest Effect: Long-term investing can fully utilize the effects of compound interest, achieving exponential growth of wealth. Avoid Emotional Trading: Long-term investing can avoid making poor investment decisions due to short-term market fluctuations. Reduce Transaction Costs: Long-term investing can reduce the frequency of trading, thereby lowering transaction costs. Relationship Between US Dollar and US Stocks # Analysis of the US Balance Sheet: Detailed Data: James provided detailed US balance sheet data, including: Total US Government and Private Borrowing: This refers to the total domestic debt of all forms in the United States. Total Assets: $202 trillion, representing the total value of all US assets. Deficit: $36 trillion, referring to the US government\u0026rsquo;s fiscal deficit. Total Liabilities: $101 trillion, including the total debt of the government and the public, which is actually the amount of US currency issued. GDP: $28.57 trillion, representing the total value of all goods and services produced within the US in one year. Federal Tax Revenue: $12 trillion, referring to the US federal government\u0026rsquo;s tax revenue. Income Estimation: Based on an average tax rate of 15%, it is estimated that the total income of US individuals and companies is about $80 trillion. James pointed out that because corporate tax rates are usually higher than 20%, this estimate may actually underestimate the actual income of the US, and the real number might be close to $100 trillion. Debt-to-Income Ratio: By comparing total liabilities to income, the US debt-to-income ratio was calculated and compared with individual debt-to-income ratios, explaining that the US balance sheet is very healthy and will not experience a debt crisis or bankruptcy as some people fear. Example: The US was compared to an individual with $202 million worth of real estate, owing $100 million, and with an annual income of $80 million, illustrating that its financial situation is very healthy. In comparison, many people have an income far less than $80 million but carry huge mortgage debts, and their personal financial situation is much worse than that of the US. Relationship Between the US Dollar and US Stocks: Holding Assets, Not Currency: Investing in US index funds is actually holding a portfolio of assets composed of excellent US companies, rather than holding the US dollar as a currency. Impact of US Dollar Depreciation: Even if the US dollar depreciates, as long as the assets held (such as stocks) have value, the price of assets denominated in US dollars will rise. The US Dollar Is Just a Unit of Account: The US dollar is only a unit for measuring asset value and can be exchanged for assets using any other form of currency or valuable item. For example, real estate can be used to exchange for Apple shares or QQQ assets, without needing to go through the US dollar. US Dollar Credit Backing: The US dollar, as a fiat currency, is backed by national credit. The US government can repay its debt by taxing companies and individuals. Therefore, as long as US companies and individuals can continue to generate income, the US can repay its debts, and the US dollar will not collapse. Borrowing Strategy: Since the US dollar may depreciate, it is advisable to borrow as much US dollars as possible to invest or consume. In the future, debt can be repaid using depreciated US dollars. Refuting the Bankruptcy Theory: Cited data and facts to refute the view that \u0026ldquo;excessive US debt will lead to bankruptcy.\u0026rdquo; Emphasized that the US has vast assets and a continuous source of income, which is enough to repay its debts. Pointed out that those who spread such statements may have ulterior motives, and investors should think independently and not blindly believe them. Long-Term Holding of Quality Assets: Emphasized the importance of long-term holding of high-quality US assets (such as the Nasdaq 100 index fund). Even if the US dollar depreciates, the value of quality assets will continue to grow. Example: If QQQ is currently $500, after a large US dollar depreciation, QQQ may rise to $10,000 because it represents the assets of 100 excellent US technology companies. No Need to Worry About the US Dollar: Investors should focus on the value of the assets themselves, rather than fluctuations in the US dollar. US dollar depreciation is actually a good thing for investors holding quality assets because they can buy the same assets with fewer US dollars. Asset Allocation and Balance # 433 Asset Allocation: Definition: The 433 asset allocation is an investment strategy that allocates 40% of total assets to QQQ (Nasdaq 100 index fund), 30% to TQQQ (3x leveraged Nasdaq 100 index fund), and 30% to cash or money market funds. Purpose: By allocating assets with different risk levels, balance risk and return. Operation: Conduct \u0026ldquo;smart rebalancing\u0026rdquo; according to market conditions, that is, when the market rises, transfer some of the profits from TQQQ to cash; when the market falls, transfer cash to TQQQ. Smart Rebalancing: Mechanism: When the market rises: Convert some of the profits (usually 30%) from leveraged funds (such as TQQQ) into cash. When the market falls: Convert cash into leveraged funds in a certain proportion (usually 20% of the cash portion). Effects: At market highs: The cash level is high, reducing the risk of a high-level pullback. At market lows: The cash level is low, allowing for buying more assets at lower prices, thus achieving greater returns when the market rebounds. Auto-Pilot: The smart rebalancing mechanism can automatically adjust asset allocation according to market conditions without manual intervention. Examples: The internet bubble in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008 were used to illustrate how the 433 asset allocation and smart rebalancing mechanism protect investors\u0026rsquo; assets during significant market volatility. Necessity of Long-Term Investment: Citing Howard Marks\u0026rsquo;s views, it is explained that predicting short-term market trends is almost impossible, and frequent trading will only increase costs and risks. For ordinary investors, holding passive funds (such as QQQ) for the long term is a wiser choice. Avoid Frequent Trading: Combining data on the losses of Taiwanese day traders, the risks and harms of short-term trading are explained. Other # Essence of the Financial Industry: The goal of the financial industry is to maximize its own interests and may \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; investors\u0026rsquo; pockets through various means. Investors must improve their financial literacy to recognize and resist the traps and temptations of the financial industry. For example, long-term bond products may appear stable in name, but still have the potential to lose 30% or more. Information Filter Bubble Effect: The development of the internet and social media makes it easier for people to access information that matches their own views, thus forming information filter bubbles and making it difficult to hear different opinions. This leads to biases in people\u0026rsquo;s understanding of the world and even conflicting emotions. Australian 2x Leveraged Fund GNDQ: Introduced an Australian market 2x leveraged fund called GNDQ, for Australian investors to reference. International Situation and Investment: Although we may know nothing about the international situation, this does not affect our long-term investments. The important thing is to choose the right investment targets and stick to them for the long term. Allocation Strategies for Roth IRA and Traditional IRA: It is recommended to invest all the funds in Roth IRA in TQQQ to maximize tax-free returns. Traditional IRA can allocate a portion to cash and a portion to QQQ, with the specific ratio depending on individual circumstances. Risks of Labor and Real Estate: Labor is facing the risk of unemployment, especially with the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Real estate also has risks, such as natural disasters and market volatility. Impact of AI on the Future: The development of AI will have a huge impact on the job market, with a large number of jobs being replaced by AI. In the future, society may only be left with a small number of capitalists and people who can control AI, while others may become \u0026ldquo;useless\u0026rdquo; laborers. Therefore, one should no longer learn coding but should use AI to serve oneself. Predictions on Future High-Tech Returns: Some finance professionals predict that future high-tech returns will decrease. James refuted this view, believing that these predictions are baseless and pointed out that the investment performance of these predictors is also poor. Encourage Learning and Sharing: Encourage everyone to watch the short films of the investment lectures and share them with more people to help them build correct investment philosophies. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Cat # Sharing: The annualized return rate of long-term investment does not mean that fixed returns can be obtained every year. If the investment period is too short, the desired results may not be achieved due to market fluctuations. She cited a chart from a book called \u0026ldquo;The Long View,\u0026rdquo; which shows the highest and lowest returns for different investment periods. For example, investing for one year, the highest return might be 66%, but it could also result in a loss of 38%; investing for two years, the highest return is 39.4%, but it could also lead to a loss of 31.7%; investing for five years, the highest return is 27.3%, but it could also result in a loss of 11.9%. Only when the investment period is more than 20 years is it possible to obtain a return ranging from a minimum of 6% to a maximum of 17%. In summary, the longer the investment period, the more the return rate tends to approach the long-term average. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: The longer the investment period, the closer the return is to the average. For example, if you invest for 25 years, the return will increasingly approach 10%. This explains the significance of the 433 asset allocation: short-term cash needs can be met with the cash position, while long-term investment is not affected. For example, if an investment portfolio has 10 million in long-term investments and 1 million for school tuition, the 1 million can be combined with the 10 million for 433 allocation. This would mean 300,000 in cash, and even if the market declines, the 300,000 cash can cover tuition needs. It was also emphasized that stock pledging can further reduce risk, because low-interest funds can be borrowed to meet emergency needs. Four Five # Question 1: The company\u0026rsquo;s 401K plan can deposit 30% of income, which is far more than the IRS limit. The extra funds are put into an after-tax account. If the principal of this part is transferred to Roth IRA, and the appreciated part is transferred to Regular IRA, are there any tax issues with such operations? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The after-tax 401K plan you mentioned is actually a tax-deferred account, which allows investors to put their after-tax income into it and conduct tax-free trading, but still have to pay taxes when finally withdrawn. For short-term operators, this type of account can avoid tax liabilities caused by frequent trading. However, for long-term investors like us, we do not make frequent buying and selling transactions, so this type of account does not have much appeal to us. The disadvantage of participating in this plan is that it actually increases the size of your Traditional IRA, and we generally advise against having too large a Traditional IRA because you will have to pay income tax when you withdraw in the future. Therefore, I do not recommend that you continue to participate and put money into this after-tax 401K plan. Question 2: I am 60 years old, and my current asset allocation is 70% of my money in Traditional IRA, 10% in Roth IRA, and 15% in Regular IRA. How should I allocate my assets? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Given that your Roth IRA ratio is low, it is recommended to invest all the funds in your Roth IRA into TQQQ (3x leveraged Nasdaq 100 index fund) to maximize its potential for tax-free growth. For your Traditional IRA, it is recommended to allocate 20% to cash and 80% to QQQ (Nasdaq 100 index fund). This will make your overall asset allocation closer to the target of 433 (40% QQQ, 30% TQQQ, 30% cash). Question 3: I am already using asset-backed loans, borrowing about 1% of the funds each year for use. According to the asset allocation ratio recommended by the teacher, my current cash ratio is insufficient. What should I do? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: In this case, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to specifically increase your cash ratio. You only need to allocate 20% of the cash in your Traditional IRA and the remaining 80% to QQQ, and all the money in your Roth IRA to TQQQ. Use asset-backed loans to meet your daily expenses and tax payments, so that you do not need to use your investment principal. Continue to maintain the annual borrowing and use the loan to cover some expenses, so that your investment portfolio can continue to grow. Ling # Sharing 1: The US government has a very complete retirement plan. In contrast, Taiwan has a big gap in guaranteeing its people\u0026rsquo;s retirement. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s labor insurance retirement account requires employers to set aside 6% of employees\u0026rsquo; salaries in accordance with the law, and employees can choose to self-allocate 0% to 6% of their salaries. When Ling first started working, there was only the 6% set aside by the employer. Later, following the advice of colleagues, she chose to self-allocate 6% to increase retirement savings and deduct income tax. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: There is no need to participate, because Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s securities accounts are tax-free. Sharing 2: After listening to James\u0026rsquo;s concept of investing in QQQ in November last year, Ling decided to change the self-allocated portion to 0% and use all the funds for investing in QQQ. In addition, Ling\u0026rsquo;s company provides two options, \u0026ldquo;employee stock trust\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;employee savings trust,\u0026rdquo; aimed at helping employees increase retirement funds. Previously, she did not know enough and chose the \u0026ldquo;employee stock trust\u0026rdquo; investing in company stocks, but the return in the past six years was only about 38%. If she had followed James\u0026rsquo;s QQQ investment philosophy, the performance might be higher. Therefore, she has recently made adjustments and has chosen the \u0026ldquo;employee savings trust\u0026rdquo; starting this year. However, the investment targets of this \u0026ldquo;employee savings trust\u0026rdquo; are limited and cannot be directly invested in QQQ. Only funds can be chosen. Currently, Ling plans to invest the company\u0026rsquo;s portion in US technology funds and the self-allocated portion in Taiwan stock funds. Although the monthly investment amount is not large, Ling believes it still needs to be further optimized. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s securities accounts are tax-free, which is equivalent to the US Roth IRA, and there is no contribution limit, which is a very big advantage. Therefore, Taiwanese investors can directly use their own securities accounts for investments, especially in index funds such as QQQ, and do not need to participate in any retirement plans of the government or companies. These plans often have various restrictions, and the performance may not be good either. Taiwanese investors should take full advantage of this and invest funds directly into their securities accounts to enjoy tax-free investment income. Sharing 3: Since November last year, Ling has watched all of James\u0026rsquo;s videos before 2024 and continues to learn from the following videos. Ling compares investing in QQQ to a \u0026ldquo;big pool.\u0026rdquo; As soon as funds become available, she immediately puts them in, and regards it as her \u0026ldquo;real estate.\u0026rdquo; This \u0026ldquo;big pool\u0026rdquo; will continue to grow over time and is safer than traditional real estate. There is no need to worry about risks such as earthquakes, windstorms, or floods. When money is needed, she borrows through asset pledging to obtain funds instead of selling assets. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s financial environment is very friendly. In addition to tax-free securities accounts, the interest on asset-backed loans is also very low, which is an advantage that other regions cannot compare. Taiwanese investors should take full advantage of these \u0026ldquo;free bullets\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;sophisticated weapons,\u0026rdquo; do a good job in asset allocation, and the future wealth growth potential is huge. Regarding pledging, there is no need to wait until assets reach 10 million TWD to start. It can be decided based on your own circumstances and knowledge of assets. Even with only 2 million TWD of assets, you can try pledging to borrow a small amount of money each year (for example, 40,000 TWD) for use. As experience accumulates and assets grow, the borrowing amount can gradually be increased. Warm Heart # Sharing 1: He began learning James\u0026rsquo;s investment courses in 2022 and created an investment discussion group on Line in Taiwan in 2023. He emphasized that this group is self-organized, has no affiliation with the CLEC official, and has not received authorization or any form of assistance from James. The original intention of creating this group was to find more like-minded people to discuss investments, especially about 00662 (Yuanta Baoshu Shenzhen) and James\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy. Currently, this group has developed into a learning community of more than 500 people. Sharing 2: He mentioned that he is also facing a situation where his family does not understand his investment methods. For example, his father would question why he doesn\u0026rsquo;t sell at high points but chooses to hold for the long term. In order to make his family better understand his investment philosophy, he invited his family to join the Line group he created, hoping that through the discussions within the group, his family could understand the advantages and value of long-term investment and reduce their concerns. Sharing 3: He particularly thanked several core members of the group, including Brother Chen, Mark, Chris, and QQM, for their contributions to the group\u0026rsquo;s development. Sharing 4: He revealed that Brother Chen in the group will be sharing his experiences from 2 PM to 7 PM tomorrow (January 19th) and provided a link for everyone to participate. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: James expressed support and encouragement for this kind of self-organized learning community, believing that this form can help more people learn and spread the correct investment philosophy. He also emphasized that he himself does not privately provide any special resources or guidance to anyone or any group. All sharing will be done on public platforms to ensure transparency and fairness of information. He also reminded everyone that although these self-organized groups are usually made with good intentions, they should be vigilant and pay attention to potential risks. He himself and CLEC will not be responsible for the operation and management of these groups. Mike # Sharing: He went hiking with a friend, who is also a member of CLEC. The two talked about the recent layoffs at Google due to AI development. This triggered their thinking about the future development of AI, especially whether AI will threaten humans due to its own \u0026ldquo;rationality,\u0026rdquo; for example, whether AI will deliberately leave bugs in its programs to avoid being shut down by humans. Question: What is the future development direction of AI? What impact will it have on human work? In particular, will AI develop self-awareness and threaten humans? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The development of AI will have a huge impact on the job market. In the future, most people will face the risk of unemployment, and only a few capitalists and those who can control AI will be able to survive. Therefore, everyone should start learning and mastering AI tools now, and use them as assistants to improve work efficiency. At the same time, every country should pay attention to the development of AI, especially a comprehensive AI strategy. Currently, the United States and China are at the forefront in this area, while Europe and Taiwan are relatively lagging behind. If Taiwan wants to remain competitive in the AI era, it needs to significantly increase the salary levels of engineers and increase the TWD exchange rate to attract top talent from around the world. As for whether AI will develop self-awareness and threaten humans, this is indeed a concern. In the future, there may be a confrontation between \u0026ldquo;righteous AI\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;villainous AI,\u0026rdquo; just like in the movie \u0026ldquo;The Matrix.\u0026rdquo; This is also one of the reasons why Elon Musk is committed to developing more powerful AI and trying to guide it toward goodness. Question: How does James view the practice of restricting certain countries from accessing certain advanced technologies (such as AI)? Is this a form of discrimination? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This is a complex issue that can be discussed publicly, but it is necessary to avoid political stances and remain objective and rational. Efforts should be made to make information public and transparent. Question: What is China\u0026rsquo;s current asset situation? In addition, what impact does AI have on the stock markets of various countries? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Every country has its own problems. China\u0026rsquo;s data is not completely transparent, and it is difficult to obtain accurate information. Currently, AI has the most significant impact on the stock markets of the United States and Taiwan, while other countries are relatively less affected. Jenny # Question 1: James previously suggested keeping cash in an IRA account rather than a Brokerage Account. Why is that? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Because the capital gains in the SEP IRA account also needs to be taxed, in order to avoid its rapid growth, it is recommended to keep your existing funds in your SEP IRA account as is and no longer contribute to it. The funds in the Brokerage Account can be used for asset-backed loans. You can continue to use the annual quota to deposit funds into your SEP IRA and then transfer it to a ROTH IRA. Question 2: Do I need to keep some cash in my Brokerage Account? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: No, you do not. You can obtain emergency funds through asset-backed loans. For example, if you have $5 million in Brokerage Account assets, you can obtain a credit line of approximately $3.5 million, which is sufficient to deal with most emergencies. You can first apply to open the asset-backed loan function, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t use it for the time being. When you need money, you can borrow from it at any time, for example, occasionally borrowing $100,000 to pay taxes. Question 3: You always emphasize that QQQ should \u0026ldquo;never be sold.\u0026rdquo; So should QLD or TQQQ in a Roth IRA account also \u0026ldquo;never be sold?\u0026rdquo; But doesn\u0026rsquo;t TQQQ have various fees and losses? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Yes, even QLD and TQQQ should be held for the long term and not bought and sold frequently. Although TQQQ has some management fees and fluctuation losses, these losses are acceptable in the long term considering its huge growth potential. We should focus on long-term results rather than short-term fluctuations. For example, if QQQ increases 200 times in 40 years, then TQQQ may increase 600 times, which is a very substantial return. Question 4: In a Roth IRA account, if I don’t buy QLD, can I buy TQQQ? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: I don’t give specific investment advice. Whether to buy TQQQ is your own choice. I can only tell you that the data we use for backtesting is based on QQQ. If you change the volatility, I will not be able to answer the questions you may encounter. Question 5: For a child\u0026rsquo;s Roth IRA account, do you recommend buying QLD or QQQ? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: For children’s accounts, regardless of the account type, as long as the investment period is long enough, for example, 40 years, it is okay to consider investing in QLD as much as possible to maximize tax-free gains. Brian # Sharing: He used James\u0026rsquo;s 433 asset allocation simulator to verify his investment logic and made adjustments according to his own circumstances. His current asset allocation is 80/20 (80% QQQ, 20% TQQQ). He plans to gradually transition to 40/30 (40% QQQ, 30% TQQQ, 30% cash) after retirement. He also shared his work experience in the AI field, mainly responsible for AI applications in power systems. He agrees with James\u0026rsquo;s view that AI will eventually replace most human jobs, but some jobs are still difficult to replace in the short term, such as the construction industry. He also mentioned that the degree of demand for AI varies from region to region due to differences in labor costs. Finally, he shared that he would choose to stay in better hotels when he travels for business to enjoy life, rather than just saving money. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: In the process of market uptrend, your cash ratio must be greater than your liabilities. This is the most important principle. The 433 asset allocation has been verified by backtesting and can cope with the worst market conditions. If you cannot achieve the 433 allocation for the time being, you must at least ensure that the cash ratio is higher than your liabilities. At the same time, you can re-allocate your new capital each month. Regarding AI, although AI will eventually replace most jobs, some jobs are still difficult to replace in the short term. For example, the construction industry still requires a lot of physical labor, and AI cannot completely replace it in the short term. IM # Sharing: He didn’t quite understand what James meant by \u0026ldquo;always being optimistic\u0026rdquo; and the relationship between \u0026ldquo;risk control\u0026rdquo; before, nor did he fully understand the advice on consumption behaviors such as buying houses and cars. After a period of reflection, he gradually understood the logic behind these concepts. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: At this stage, you can spend more money appropriately and enjoy life. The key is to learn to borrow money for consumption, rather than spending your own money. Investing and consumption are not contradictory; the important thing is to master the methods. For example, you can choose to take a taxi instead of spending time waiting for a bus. You can choose to spend money to buy a better car and enjoy a better driving experience, as long as you don’t spend your own money but pay through loans or other means. In 40 years, you will have 80 billion. Now, what you should be thinking about is how to spend money, not how to save money. IV. Key Quotes # Investing in US indices means holding US assets, not holding US currency. \u0026ndash; James\nInvesting in US stock index funds is about holding the assets of excellent US companies.

Episode Theme # This episode focuses on long-term investment in the Nasdaq 100 index fund, emphasizing the importance of avoiding interference from market fluctuations, international situations, financial statements, and economic situations. It delves into the safety of leveraged investing and correct asset allocation methods, including the 433 and 442 asset allocation strategies. Additionally, it discusses the psychological preparation in the investment process, deep understanding of capitalism, and shares how to achieve financial and personal freedom through investment.\nII. Briefing Content # Market Fluctuations and Investment Strategies # Market fluctuations, international situations, market analysis, financial statements, economic situations, etc., are irrelevant to individual investment returns. Teacher James emphasizes that these factors are often overhyped by the media and financial institutions but have minimal impact on long-term investors\u0026rsquo; returns. Investors should focus on long-term trends rather than short-term fluctuations. Investors should avoid being influenced by market noise and news. Misleading information in the market can easily lead investors to make wrong decisions. In the long run, these short-term fluctuations are offset by the market\u0026rsquo;s long-term growth trend. Investment should be based on a strategy of long-term holding of the Nasdaq 100 index fund, without frequent trading. Frequent trading not only generates high transaction costs but also increases investment risk. The long-term holding strategy can reduce risks and enjoy the benefits of compound interest. Asset Allocation and Leverage # The risk of leveraged investing is lower than that of non-leveraged investing. Teacher James explains that those who use leverage have more cash reserves in times of crisis, making them more resilient than those without cash reserves. The key is whether the borrowed money is invested in the right assets, such as stocks of high-quality companies. Investors are advised to borrow early and incorporate the funds into their asset allocation. Early borrowing allows funds to be invested in the market, enjoying longer compound interest growth. Even keeping the borrowed money as a backup is safer than not being able to obtain a loan when needed. Newly listed funds have larger tracking errors; it is recommended to invest in established funds. Newly listed funds, due to their smaller size, require more hedging operations, resulting in larger tracking errors that affect investment returns. It is advisable to choose established funds like 00662, which have larger scale and smaller tracking errors. Asset allocation should be based on individual circumstances, such as the 433 or 442 strategies, with intelligent rebalancing. The 433 strategy refers to 40% core fund (e.g., QQQ), 30% leveraged fund (e.g., QLD), and 30% cash. The 442 strategy refers to 40% core fund, 40% leveraged fund, and 20% cash. Intelligent rebalancing involves transferring a portion of the profits from the leveraged fund to cash in rising years and transferring a portion of cash to the leveraged fund in declining years. Borrowing should not exceed a certain percentage of total assets and should be combined with asset allocation to achieve automatic navigation. The amount of new borrowing each year can be gradually increased. For example, in the first year, you can borrow 1%-2% of the total assets, and then increase it slightly each year. The specific proportion depends on the individual\u0026rsquo;s debt tolerance. In the long-term investment process, total assets grow at a rate of more than 10% per year, while debt grows at a rate of 2% per year. Therefore, borrowing money is very safe in the long run. Through intelligent rebalancing, the automatic navigation of the investment portfolio can be achieved without frequent adjustments. Investors should be extremely optimistic. Regardless of any disasters or market downturns, investors should remain optimistic because the market will eventually rise and break new highs. Real Estate and Natural Disasters # Real estate is a high-risk asset, subject to risks such as windstorms, floods, earthquakes, and fires. In the United States, in addition to the above risks, there are also risks of tornadoes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters. These disasters can lead to significant depreciation or even complete loss of property value. In contrast, the Nasdaq 100 index fund includes 100 companies, does not require payment of taxes, maintenance fees, insurance fees, and is not affected by natural disasters. These 100 companies are among the best in the United States and even globally, with high long-term investment returns. It is recommended to transfer the risk of real estate to the landlord by renting instead of owning property to avoid risks. Owning property requires various maintenance costs, taxes, and risks from natural disasters. Renting can transfer these risks to the landlord, and you only need to pay rent. Long-Term Investment and Life Goals # Investment should control emotions, understand history, and look at the present from the future. Investing requires rationality, avoiding emotional decisions. By understanding historical market fluctuations and economic cycles, one can better grasp investment opportunities. Looking at the present from the future can strengthen confidence in long-term investment. The value of the Nasdaq 100 index fund will far exceed its current value in the future, and long-term holding will bring substantial returns. With the advancement of technology and economic development, the value of the Nasdaq 100 index fund will continue to grow. The most important goal in life is to fulfill one\u0026rsquo;s mission, not to pursue money, fame, and power. Money is only a tool to achieve life goals, not the goal itself. One should consider how to use wealth to realize one\u0026rsquo;s life values. Money is a tool, and one should learn to spend money, especially for wealthy retirees; spending money is a virtue. Retirees should learn to enjoy life and use their wealth to improve their quality of life and achieve their life goals. At the same time, spending money can promote economic flow and create more opportunities for young people. Elderly people who have retired and are very wealthy should spend money as a moral duty. Spending money can stimulate the economy, allowing young people to earn more, and they may also consider having children and getting married. Cycles and Investment Experience # Predicting cycles is difficult and requires more than 40 years of market experience to fully understand a cycle. Market cycles are usually long, and it is difficult for people with insufficient investment experience to accurately predict changes in cycles. Invest in the US Nasdaq 100 index fund because the US is the source of the world\u0026rsquo;s strongest currency and innovative technology. The United States has strong economic strength and innovation capabilities. In the long run, investing in the US market has a high potential for return. In addition to listening to the opinions of Buffett and Peter Lynch, one should also learn from the experiences of failures. By learning from the lessons of failures, one can avoid making the same mistakes and improve the probability of investment success. Probability, accidents, and randomness: Even if there is a 99.99% chance of success and only a 0.1% chance of failure, do not do it because when you do it, it is random. Capitalism and Wealth # In capitalism, if you have money, buy index funds, and you will become rich. In a capitalist society, investment is an important way to achieve wealth growth. Due to their diversified investment characteristics, index funds can reduce risks and obtain average market returns. To become a millionaire, one needs to understand borrowing. Moderate borrowing can amplify investment returns and accelerate wealth accumulation. However, it should be noted that borrowing must be based on safety and controllability. Real estate loans require repayment of principal and interest, and retirees should avoid such loans. The income source of retirees is usually relatively fixed, and the pressure to repay principal and interest is greater, which may affect the quality of life. Convert mortgages to home equity lines of credit to reduce monthly expenses. Home equity lines of credit only require interest payments, not principal repayment, which can reduce monthly repayment pressure. The US borrows money to develop its domestic investment economy. The US can borrow a little more money and repay it in 20 or 30 years. In fact, the US does not want to repay the debt. It borrows new debt to repay old debt. The money is never repaid, and the currency will depreciate. Borrowing without principal repayment is acceptable. Suppose you have 30 million in retirement savings, at 2%, you can spend 600,000 a year, or 50,000 a month. Practice of Asset Allocation # According to Monte Carlo simulations, the intelligent rebalancing strategy can maintain the same return as 100% investment in QQQ while reducing risk. Through historical data simulation, the intelligent rebalancing strategy has proven to be an effective asset allocation method. Questions about asset allocation should be resolved through learning and practice, rather than simply relying on the advice of others. Investment is a process of continuous learning and practice. Only through one\u0026rsquo;s own practice can one truly understand the principles and methods of asset allocation. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Cat # Question: Details of the 433 asset allocation strategy, especially the specific steps for rebalancing at the end of the year, and how to understand the concept of \u0026ldquo;automatic navigation.\u0026rdquo; Many students are confused about how to readjust the asset allocation back to the 433 ratio. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: When rebalancing at the end of the year, only the leveraged fund (Q2D) and cash portions need to be adjusted, without touching the core fund (QQQ). In a rising year:\nCalculate the annual return of Q2D (year-end asset - beginning-year asset). If there were additional investments during the year, subtract the amount of additional investments. Transfer 1/3 of the annual return of Q2D to the cash account. In a declining year:\nCalculate 2% of the total assets. Transfer 2% of the total assets from the cash account to the Q2D account. Automatic navigation means that once the initial asset allocation and annual intelligent rebalancing are completed, there is no need to frequently monitor or adjust the asset ratio, allowing the investment portfolio to operate automatically according to the preset strategy.\nPin # Share: Pin shared a book called \u0026ldquo;Die with Zero,\u0026rdquo; which puts forward a novel point of view: every meaningful experience in life is an investment, similar to financial investment. These experiences can bring spiritual returns, and these returns will increase over time. The book compares this kind of experience investment to financial investment. Every positive experience is like depositing the \u0026ldquo;principal\u0026rdquo; into the memory bank. Every time you recall or share these experiences afterward, you can get \u0026ldquo;interest\u0026rdquo;—happiness and satisfaction. As we age, these memories become more and more precious, just like compound interest in financial investment, whose value continues to grow. Pin took herself as an example. She decided to quit her job to accompany her elderly parents. Although this was a difficult decision financially, she regarded this experience as a valuable investment, and its return would far exceed the loss of money. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s comment: Teacher James agreed with Pin\u0026rsquo;s sharing and further explained that the purpose of life is to convert material energy into spiritual energy. Money is just a tool. The real purpose is to obtain spiritual satisfaction and happiness. We should use money to create beautiful experiences, not just accumulate numbers. He took a chart in the \u0026ldquo;One Billion Investment Lecture\u0026rdquo; as an example to illustrate how to convert material energy into spiritual energy and emphasized that ultimately we should pursue spiritual abundance. Sunny # Question 1: Three years ago, she mortgaged a house and borrowed 10 million NTD in a home equity line of credit, but this money has not been used. Now she has some concerns. After these three years, she wonders if she should be braver and use this money, but she is worried about her nervous personality. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Teacher James believes that Sunny\u0026rsquo;s personality is too nervous and not suitable for complex investment operations. And pointed out that if you have a nervous personality, you are not suitable for investment. Question 2: Previously, she listened to some suggestions in the market and bought a large number of 20-year long-term bonds, resulting in a relatively high proportion of bonds in the current investment portfolio, and it is currently in a state of loss. Now that the market trend has changed and she is facing losses, how should she deal with this bond investment? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Teacher James pointed out that Sunny should not invest in long-term bonds and emphasized that funds should be concentrated on assets that can make money. He suggested that Sunny watch investment course videos to learn the correct investment strategy instead of blindly following various suggestions in the market. Question 3: Should she sell all the bonds now and transfer all the proceeds to buy QQQ? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Considering that Sunny is retired and has a fixed monthly pension, it is recommended that she reallocate all assets (including bonds, cash, etc.), invest 80% of the assets in 00662 (Taiwan ETF tracking the Nasdaq 100 Index), and invest 20% of the assets in 00864B (Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s short-term bond ETF, equivalent to cash). Question 4: She still has 20-30% cash on hand. Should these cash continue to be invested in 00662 and 00864B according to the 80/20 ratio? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Teacher James আবারও emphasized that all assets need to be added up for calculation to ensure that the final investment ratio of 00662 is 80% and the investment ratio of 00864B is 20%. If the cash ratio is insufficient, she may need to sell some bonds to increase the cash ratio. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s additional explanation: Teacher James emphasized the importance of investment education and suggested that Sunny spend time watching course videos to systematically learn investment knowledge instead of just seeking a simple answer. He pointed out that there is no shortcut to investment and it takes time and energy to learn and understand. Eugene # Question 1: When transferring a 401k account from one institution to another (TIAA), TIAA charged a 0.3% account management fee. He asked whether this fee was reasonable and whether it was too high. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Teacher James believes that the 0.3% management fee is reasonable and not too high. When conducting account transfers, such fees are normal and are necessary expenses. Question 2: Does the asset allocation strategy mentioned earlier include all types of assets, such as retirement accounts (such as 401k), real estate, etc.? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Teacher James clearly pointed out that the asset allocation strategy only includes liquid assets, that is, assets that can be easily bought and sold, such as 401k, IRA, personal brokerage accounts (which can buy and sell stocks, funds, ETFs, etc.). Real estate is not a liquid asset, so it is not included in the scope of asset allocation. Zhang Yong # Share: Zhang Yong shared his deep understanding of Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s concept of \u0026ldquo;wealth is a talent, and happiness is a human right.\u0026rdquo; He found that in reality, many people\u0026rsquo;s behaviors are contrary to this concept, based on his work and life experience. He realized that many people, including himself, are misled by the traditional financial system and engage in unreasonable financial behaviors such as forced savings. He believes that Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s course system and philosophy are truthful and can help people achieve financial freedom. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s comment: Teacher James agreed with Zhang Yong\u0026rsquo;s sharing and further explained the essence of the capitalist system and financial system. He pointed out that the history of the development of capitalism, especially after the Industrial Revolution, led to the emergence of the working class and gradually evolved into an invisible \u0026ldquo;slavery\u0026rdquo; system. The government, financial institutions, and capitalists have jointly built a \u0026ldquo;Truman\u0026rsquo;s World\u0026rdquo; where most people live according to a set script without realizing it. Teacher James used the movie \u0026ldquo;The Truman Show\u0026rdquo; as an example to point out that this \u0026ldquo;script\u0026rdquo; was jointly set by capitalists, the government, and financial institutions to make most people become laborers and serve the capitalist system. Most people, including senior executives in the financial industry, do not even realize that they are \u0026ldquo;actors\u0026rdquo; in this system. Only a few people can see the truth and achieve true financial freedom. Teacher James emphasized that the purpose of his course is to help everyone recognize the existence of this \u0026ldquo;scam\u0026rdquo; and find ways to achieve financial freedom. Question: Many people are busy working and living, but their behaviors and ideas are contrary to the concept of achieving financial freedom. Most people seem to be misled by the traditional financial system and make unreasonable financial plans. Zhang Yong wants to know the essential reasons for this widespread phenomenon and how to change this situation. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Teacher James explained that the root cause of this phenomenon is the capitalist system itself. Since the Industrial Revolution, the capitalist system has gradually turned most people into laborers and built a complete system to maintain this state. This system instills the concepts of \u0026ldquo;work hard, save, and invest\u0026rdquo; in people through multiple channels such as education, media, and financial institutions, but in fact, it is \u0026ldquo;enslaving\u0026rdquo; most people. He pointed out that this is a \u0026ldquo;war without sound and breath\u0026rdquo; and most people do not realize that they are in it. Teacher James believes that to change this situation, we must first recognize the existence of this \u0026ldquo;scam\u0026rdquo;, and then gradually achieve financial freedom by learning the correct investment concepts and methods. He emphasized that we cannot change the entire system, but we can change ourselves and let ourselves and our families live a better life. Tina # Question 1: Tina has currently invested most of her assets in 00662 (Taiwan) and NDQ (Australia) ETFs, and plans to transfer her Australian retirement fund to NDQ in the future. She asked whether she should conduct asset allocation after completing all investments or start considering the allocation of other assets now. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Teacher James suggested that Tina conduct asset allocation as soon as possible, rather than considering it after all funds are invested in specific assets. He believes that asset allocation should be a quick decision-making process that can be completed within a day. For those who have not retired and have not borrowed money, they can choose the 433 or 442 asset allocation strategy; for those who are close to retirement or have retired, they should use the 80/20 asset allocation strategy. Question 2: If according to the 442 strategy, Tina has allocated 40% of her assets to 00662 and NDQ, then after transferring the Australian retirement fund next month, should she invest in 00670L (Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s leveraged ETF)? If the funds are kept in Australia, how should they be allocated? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Teacher James suggested that Tina treat the Australian retirement fund as a cash portion and allocate it according to tax factors. If in Australia, since the dividends of NDQ need to be taxed and the tax rate is high, it is not recommended to invest all retirement funds in NDQ. The Australian retirement fund can be used as a cash reserve, while the core fund (such as 00662) is allocated in Taiwan. If the cash reserve in Australia is not enough to meet the proportion of asset allocation, a portion of the funds can be remitted from Taiwan to Australia. He suggested that Tina consider tax factors and decide the specific asset allocation ratio according to her place of residence and post-retirement life arrangements. Wen Zhang # Question: Wen Zhang\u0026rsquo;s younger sister invested in a fund in Canada that tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index. The fund has a high management fee of 2.95% but promises to return 75% of the principal if the Nasdaq 100 Index falls. Wen Zhang\u0026rsquo;s younger sister is worried that she cannot control her investment behavior and may buy and sell frequently, so she is interested in this high-management-fee but guaranteed fund. Wen Zhang wants to know Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s opinion on this fund and whether there are better investment options. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Teacher James first pointed out that if investors cannot control their investment behavior, then investing in any product may face risks. He believes that the investor\u0026rsquo;s mentality and self-control are the key factors for investment success. Regarding specific investment advice, Teacher James suggested investing in the Canadian version of QQQ, such as QQC or XQQ. These ETFs directly track the Nasdaq 100 Index, have lower management fees, and have higher long-term investment returns. However, Teacher James also emphasized that the final investment choice should be based on the investor\u0026rsquo;s risk tolerance and investment experience. If Wen Zhang\u0026rsquo;s younger sister cannot overcome the impulse to buy and sell frequently, then any investment advice may be invalid. Jenny # Question: Jenny does not have much money in her Roth IRA because her income is too high to contribute directly. She currently faces a higher tax rate and is considering whether she should convert all the funds deposited in her Traditional IRA (up to $7,000 per year) to a Roth IRA, even if she needs to pay higher taxes. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Teacher James thinks this is a good idea. Since Jenny\u0026rsquo;s Traditional IRA amount is already large, she will face a higher tax rate when withdrawing in the future. By converting funds to a Roth IRA, she can enjoy future tax-free growth. He suggested that Jenny make the conversion, even if she needs to pay taxes now, but it is worthwhile in the long run. Question 2: In addition to the annual limit of $7,000, can more be converted? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Yes. Additional explanation: Teacher James further explained why a Roth IRA is needed. He suggested buying leveraged funds (such as QLD) in the Roth IRA and allocating an equivalent amount of cash in the Traditional IRA or other taxable accounts. This can reduce the growth rate of the Traditional IRA, thereby reducing future tax burdens. For example, if there is $500,000 of QLD in the Roth IRA, then $500,000 of cash can be allocated in the Traditional IRA. As the Roth IRA grows, the cash allocation in the Traditional IRA can be increased accordingly. Julie # Question: Julie observed that the recent volatility of QQQ is relatively large, with daily gains and losses often exceeding 1%. She wants to know the reasons behind this phenomenon and whether this high volatility will continue in the future. She believes that the volatility of QQQ in previous years was relatively small, and there would not be such large daily gains and losses unless there were major events. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Teacher James first pointed out that Julie\u0026rsquo;s observation has a \u0026ldquo;recency bias\u0026rdquo;, that is, people tend to pay too much attention to recent events while ignoring long-term trends. He showed the long-term trend chart of QQQ (including linear and logarithmic charts) to illustrate that in the long run, the volatility of QQQ has not increased significantly. The recent large fluctuations are because the price of QQQ has risen to a higher level, so even a 1% fluctuation is larger in absolute terms than in the past. Teacher James emphasized that a logarithmic chart should be used to observe long-term trends because the logarithmic chart can more accurately reflect the magnitude of asset price fluctuations. Houqi # Share: Houqi shared the investment experience of a friend. This friend started participating in the company\u0026rsquo;s 401k plan when he was young, but he didn\u0026rsquo;t pay much attention at first, just investing according to the company\u0026rsquo;s match. Many years later, he was surprised to find that his 401k account had accumulated more than one million US dollars in assets. This case illustrates the power of compound interest. Even small regular investments can generate huge returns after a long period of accumulation. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s comment: Teacher James agreed with Houqi\u0026rsquo;s sharing and further explained the power of compound interest. He took the US 401k plan as an example, assuming an annual investment of 20,000 US dollars, calculated at a 14% annualized rate of return, it can accumulate to 30 million US dollars after 40 years. Even if calculated at a lower 10% annualized rate of return in the past, it can also accumulate to 9 million US dollars. This example illustrates that long-term investment and compound interest are the key factors for achieving wealth growth. IV. Wonderful Views # People who borrow money are the ones with lower risks, and people who do not borrow money have extremely high risks. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nBecause people with cash reserves can use funds immediately in an emergency, while those without cash reserves may face the risk of a broken capital chain. Those who have loans have more cash reserves in the face of crises and have stronger risk resistance than those who do not have cash reserves.\nA house is a consumer product. It is a kind of money-eating support, not an investment, and it is a very high-risk support. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis sentence emphasizes the attribute of real estate as a consumer product rather than an investment product, as well as its potential high risks, including natural disasters and maintenance costs.\nTo succeed in investing, you must control your emotions. The first thing is to control your emotions. If you cannot control your emotions, please do not invest. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nEmphasizes the importance of emotional control in investing. Investing requires rationality, avoiding emotional decisions.\nIn capitalism, if you have money, buy index funds, and you will become rich. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nEmphasizes that in a capitalist society, long-term investment in index funds is an effective way to achieve wealth growth. Due to their diversified investment characteristics, index funds can reduce risks and obtain average market returns.\nYou have to recognize that real estate is a high-risk support, so it is very strange that everyone thinks that directly investing in 100 companies is very risky, but buying a house with all their assets is also very special. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis view challenges people\u0026rsquo;s general perception of real estate as a safe asset. Real estate is a high-risk asset with risks such as windstorms, floods, earthquakes, and fires.\nIf you have been speculating, then you will go bankrupt in this market. There is no need to say that if you do too much, you will go bankrupt. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis sentence warns of the risks of speculative behavior and emphasizes the importance of long-term investment. Frequent trading not only generates high transaction costs but also increases investment risk.\nMoney is not our purpose. Money is not our purpose. The whole experience of life requires money. That is our purpose. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis sentence emphasizes the essence of money as a tool, and the real purpose of life is experience and spiritual satisfaction. We should use money to create a better experience, not just accumulate numbers.\nAll passers-by, all the dogma of the financial industry are deceiving you. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nCriticism of the traditional financial system and dogma. Only you don\u0026rsquo;t know. Capitalists know it, politicians know it, but only the workers don\u0026rsquo;t know it. 99.99% of the workers think that they are living in reality and in a real environment. In fact, you are living in a scripted life without knowing it.\nSuppose you start working today, then you can borrow $20,000 every year. Then how much more will you have? You will have an extra $30 million. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis view quantifies the huge impact of leveraged investing on wealth growth. Moderate borrowing can amplify investment returns and accelerate wealth accumulation.\nThis is the power of compound interest, and let me give you an example. In the United States, 401K is $20,000. Suppose you invest $20,000 every year when you are young. With an annualized rate of return of 14%, in 40 years, you will have $30 million. You just invest without doing anything. \u0026ndash; Teacher James\nThis view reveals the great power of compound interest in long-term investment. Even a small amount of money can accumulate into amazing wealth through long-term compound interest growth.\nV.

Have you ever considered that you could have been richer? Have you ever thought that the sense of security you seek actually binds you, causing you to miss out on greater wealth?\nYes, everyone has an innate talent for wealth, a right we are born with, as natural as breathing, as natural as birds flying and fish swimming. Unfortunately, this right, this talent, has been forgotten, or even buried by our own hands through the \u0026ldquo;education\u0026rdquo; of reality and the \u0026ldquo;discipline\u0026rdquo; of society. From a young age, we are told: study hard, find a good job, work hard to earn money to support the family. No one tells us: you can be very rich, you have the right to be very rich, you don\u0026rsquo;t even have to work so hard to have it all!\nThe value of this lecture is far more than teaching you one or two investment techniques; its true value lies in awakening you from that “hamster dilemma,” making you realize your dormant wealth potential, and showing you a path to financial freedom. This path does not require you to have Einstein\u0026rsquo;s brain, nor does it require you to have Buffett\u0026rsquo;s luck, it only requires you to change your mindset, and then, to move forward steadfastly.\nVision Determines Wealth: How Far into the Future Do You See? # The extent of your vision dictates the height of your wealth. This isn\u0026rsquo;t just some motivational slogan; it\u0026rsquo;s a conclusion derived from rigorous logic and data analysis. Don\u0026rsquo;t believe it? Let\u0026rsquo;s crunch some numbers.\nMany people find investing for something decades into the future to be too distant and unrealistic. But what if we look 60 years into the future? If you have 1 million now, through sensible investments and factoring in the power of compounding, you could have assets worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in a few decades. This is entirely possible; it’s actually a conservative estimate.\nWhy don\u0026rsquo;t ordinary people realize they can have so much wealth? The reason is simple: our concept of money is too narrow, we have insufficient understanding of our potential, and we lack a deep understanding of compounding, the \u0026ldquo;eighth wonder of the world!\u0026rdquo; Our understanding of money is still at the kindergarten level, while financial giants have a Ph.D.-level understanding of money, at least.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Rat Race\u0026rdquo; Dilemma: Who Stole Your Wealth Dreams? # Why is it so hard for most salaried workers to escape the \u0026ldquo;rat race\u0026rdquo; dilemma? Because they are trapped in a carefully designed cycle: you work hard for a month, and before the paycheck even warms up, it has to go to capitalists, the government, and the bank. For that meager salary, you have to work like a rat running tirelessly in a cage, never escaping that vicious circle.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s worse is that society constantly brainwashes you with \u0026ldquo;consumerism,\u0026rdquo; telling you that buying big houses, luxury cars, and branded bags is the standard for successful people. So, you\u0026rsquo;re burdened with heavy loans, barely able to breathe under the weight of monthly interest payments. You don\u0026rsquo;t dare to quit your job easily, and you don\u0026rsquo;t dare to challenge your boss. You become a complete slave to capital.\nDo you think this is your own choice? Do you think it\u0026rsquo;s because you\u0026rsquo;re not working hard enough? No! This is a structure intentionally or unintentionally maintained by the entire society and education system. What do schools cultivate? Compliant cogs in a machine, not independent-thinking creators. Financial institutions design complex financial products, ostensibly to help you manage your money, but in reality? They earn high fees and interest, while you can\u0026rsquo;t even outpace inflation.\nThis “controlled environment” prevents you from realizing your potential for wealth, let alone changing your situation. You are like that hamster in the fable, the faster you run, the further you get from freedom.\nRe-Examining Poverty and Wealth: Breaking Down Class Barriers # Poverty is not your fault; it is the result of social structures that create class inequality. This structural inequality is like a thick curtain that obscures your innate talent for wealth, making you believe that you can only live a poor or middle-class life.\nThe statement \u0026ldquo;wealth is a talent\u0026rdquo; is not just a platitude, but a declaration, a solemn proclamation of your right! It tells you: you have the right to pursue a life of abundance, you have the right to enjoy beautiful things, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to sacrifice your health, your happiness, or your dreams for money!\nRecognizing this is the first step, and the most important step, to achieving financial freedom.\nThe Essence of Money: Not an End, but a Bridge to Freedom # What is money? Money is a kind of energy, a tool. In a capitalist society, money can be used to exchange for various resources and services, including time, happiness, health, and even freedom. Money can also be used for investment, growing more money like seeds.\nBut remember, money itself is not the goal, but a means to achieve our life goals. We make money not to become slaves to it, but to live better, to realize our own dreams and those of our families, to have the ability to help those in need, and to better serve society.\nOnly by truly understanding the essence of money can we view it and use it correctly, rather than being enslaved by it.\nHow Can Ordinary People Achieve Financial Freedom? It\u0026rsquo;s Actually Very Simple! # Can ordinary people really achieve financial freedom? The answer is: of course they can! Moreover, achieving financial freedom is much simpler than you imagine.\nThe key to financial freedom is not about having a high IQ, or mastering complex techniques, but rather whether you have the correct investment mindset and whether you can persevere in executing it.\nThe path to financial freedom for ordinary people is actually very simple: choose the right investment vehicle, hold it for the long term, and let the power of compounding increase your wealth like a snowball. Specifically, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to invest in the U.S. Nasdaq 100 index fund, a relatively low-risk investment choice with excellent long-term performance. In the long run, its annualized return is considerable.\nMany people might say, investing in index funds, isn\u0026rsquo;t that something even an idiot can do? Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s that simple! But the problem is, how many people can truly hold on for the long term?\nFinancial freedom is not achieved overnight; it requires patience and perseverance. In the course of investing, you will encounter all sorts of challenges and temptations, but as long as you believe in your choice and continue steadfastly, you will surely reach the other shore.\nShedding the \u0026ldquo;Poor Mindset\u0026rdquo;: From \u0026ldquo;Impossible\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;I Can Do It\u0026rdquo; # The biggest characteristic of the \u0026ldquo;poor mindset\u0026rdquo; is self-limitation. They habitually limit themselves with \u0026ldquo;impossible,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;can\u0026rsquo;t do it,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;too difficult.\u0026rdquo; They don\u0026rsquo;t see their potential or the hope for the future.\nThe key to shedding the \u0026ldquo;poor mindset\u0026rdquo; lies in changing your mindset and recognizing your wealth potential and rights. You have to believe that poverty is not your destiny, and that you have the ability to change your fate.\nSpecifically, you need to learn the right investment knowledge, rather than being led by so-called financial experts or the media. You need to understand that true wealth comes from long-term investment, not short-term speculation or blind consumption. You need to learn to delay gratification, using the money you save for investment, rather than for buying things that are non-essential.\nMore importantly, you need to cultivate the ability to think independently, not to be swayed by others or blindly follow trends. You need to develop an investment plan suitable for your own circumstances, and then steadfastly execute it.\nFinally, you must remember that financial freedom is not something that happens overnight; it requires patience and perseverance, believing in the power of compounding, and adhering to long-term investment.\nWhy Invest? Make Money Work for You, Not You for Money! # Why invest? The answer is simple: to make money work for us, not us for money.\nThrough investing, we can make our money grow continuously in the capital markets, thus realizing an increase in wealth. This increase can help us withstand inflation, ensure our future quality of life, and ultimately achieve financial freedom, so we no longer have to toil for a living.\nInvesting is also a way to plan for and secure the future. Through investment, we can accumulate funds for retirement, prepare for our children\u0026rsquo;s education, and create conditions for realizing our dreams. Imagine, when you retire, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about whether your pension is enough, you can travel the world freely, do things you love, what a wonderful life that would be!\nIn addition, investing is also a way to participate in economic development. By investing in excellent companies, we can share the dividends of their growth, and also create value for society, promoting social progress.\nWhy is it Better to Invest Early? Compounding: The Magic of Time # Why is it better to start investing early? The answer lies in the word \u0026ldquo;compounding.\u0026rdquo; Compounding, which Einstein called the \u0026ldquo;eighth wonder of the world,\u0026rdquo; is more powerful than you think.\nFor example, if we calculate with a 12% annual rate of return (a figure that can be achieved over the long term), a 30-year-old who invests $283 per month can accumulate approximately $1 million by the age of 60. But if they started investing at the age of 20, they would only need to invest $85 per month to reach the same goal!\nSee that? That is the power of compounding! The earlier you start investing, the less principal you need, and the shorter the time it takes to achieve your wealth goals. Because the effect of compounding causes your wealth to grow like a snowball, the longer the time, the faster the growth rate, and the greater the power.\nTherefore, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have much capital right now, as long as you start investing early and stick with it over the long term, you can accumulate a considerable amount of wealth. Time is the best friend of investment.\nThe Misunderstood Bonds and Real Estate: Don\u0026rsquo;t Let Them Steal Your Future # Many people think bonds are a stable investment, and some even say they\u0026rsquo;re safer than stocks. Is this really the case?\nIn the long term, bonds can actually be riskier than stocks. Don\u0026rsquo;t believe it? Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the data. How have different asset classes performed over the past 200 years, from the early 19th century to the early 21st century? The results show that the long-term returns of stocks are far higher than those of bonds, and bonds have sometimes even lost money over periods of 20 or even 30 years!\nWhy is this the case? Because the yield on bonds is usually low, making it difficult to withstand the erosion of inflation. Moreover, bond prices are affected by interest rate fluctuations and carry some risk. In contrast, although stocks fluctuate more in the short term, they have higher growth potential in the long term.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s talk about real estate. Many people believe that buying a house is the most value-preserving investment, and some even consider their house their most important asset. However, have you ever considered whether real estate is really a good investment?\nFrom an investment perspective, the main problems with real estate are its poor liquidity, high maintenance costs, and unremarkable long-term returns. Imagine if someone spent 10 million Taiwan dollars to build a villa 35 years ago, could that villa be worth 30 million Taiwan dollars 35 years later? It’s unlikely. However, if they had invested that 10 million Taiwan dollars in the stock market, based on historical average returns, the current value would have increased by two orders of magnitude, possibly becoming 1 billion Taiwan dollars!\nMore importantly, real estate also involves complex factors such as location and market fluctuations, all of which can affect its investment returns, and ordinary people find it difficult to control them.\nAnd what if you treat your home as a place to live? Then you\u0026rsquo;ll be burdened with decades of loan payments, and monthly mortgage repayments will weigh you down. For this house, you have to work hard, not dare to quit easily, and not dare to pursue your dreams, you become a complete “house slave.” Isn\u0026rsquo;t that putting the cart before the horse?\nRemember, a home to live in is essentially a consumption, not an investment.\nInvesting in the Future of Humanity is Investing in Technological Progress # Investing in the future of humanity is actually investing in technological progress and social development. Look at our history, from the agricultural age to the industrial age, and then to the information age, each significant social advancement has been accompanied by a leap in technology. This progress has led to tremendous improvements in productivity and an explosive growth in wealth.\nData shows that over the past 200 years, the long-term returns of the stock market have been far higher than those of bonds and gold. This reflects the continuous progress of human technology and productivity.\nIn the future, human society will continue to move forward, technology will continue to advance, which will bring more investment opportunities and space for wealth growth. By investing in excellent companies that represent the future and the direction of technological development, we can share in the enormous dividends that this growth will bring.\nWhy the U.S.? Because That\u0026rsquo;s Where Innovation Flourishes # Why should we look to the United States? Because it is a fertile ground for innovation, an environment where great companies are born.\nThe United States is home to the world\u0026rsquo;s best companies and top scientific talent. These companies are like perpetual motion machines, continuously driving technological progress, creating new products and services, and leading global economic development.\nMoreover, the U.S. is highly innovative, and the government usually supports the development of businesses. Furthermore, the U.S. capital markets are relatively mature and transparent, with well-established regulatory mechanisms that protect the rights of investors. This provides a relatively fair and safe investment environment for investors.\nWhy the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund? Share the Dividends of Technology Giant Growth # For ordinary people, investing in individual stocks requires specialized knowledge and a lot of effort, and the risks are also relatively high. Is there a simpler, more effective way for us to share in the dividends of U.S. technological development?\nThe answer is: the Nasdaq 100 index fund.\nThe Nasdaq 100 index fund includes the 100 largest and most representative non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq, which include many well-known tech giants such as Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.\nThese companies represent the future development direction, the future of technology, with strong innovation capabilities and huge growth potential. By investing in the Nasdaq 100 index fund, we are investing in these excellent tech companies at the same time, sharing in the generous returns from their growth.\nMoreover, investing in index funds is very simple, transparent, and relatively low-cost, making it particularly suitable for ordinary investors to hold for the long term. Compared to actively managed funds that require a lot of time and effort for research, index funds often outperform in the long run.\nThe Nasdaq 100 index fund is more focused on the tech sector compared to other broad market indices, which means it has higher growth potential. If you believe that technology is the core driving force behind future development, then the Nasdaq 100 index fund is an investment choice you cannot afford to miss.\nA Simple but Not Easy Investment Path: Why, When We Understand the Logic, Do We Still Not Do Well? # The method of investing in index funds is really simple: choose a good index fund, such as the Nasdaq 100 index fund, and then buy in regularly, holding it for the long term. It\u0026rsquo;s that simple. You don\u0026rsquo;t need a background in finance, nor do you need to monitor the market every day. You can even leave it untouched for years.\nBut why is it that so few people are actually able to do this simple thing?\nFirst, it requires you to have a long-term perspective and firm conviction. During market fluctuations, especially when the market is down, many people feel panic and anxiety, and even doubt their choice, eventually giving in and selling, and as a result? They often sell at the lowest point, missing out on the rebound that follows.\nSecond, it requires you to overcome your human weaknesses. In the course of investing, you\u0026rsquo;ll encounter all sorts of temptations: today, this stock has hit its limit up, tomorrow, that concept is hot, the day after tomorrow, experts predict the market will plummet… this noise will interfere with your judgment, leading you to deviate from your original investment plan.\nMany people, even those who have learned this simple investment method, still cannot do it well. Some investors are impatient to sell as soon as the market rises slightly, missing out on the big gains that come later; some investors, although they have set a fixed investment plan, are always unable to stick to it, going at it haphazardly; and other investors, because they hold other types of stocks or investments, are unable to make up their minds to switch to index funds.\nWhat does all of this show? It shows that the success of investing depends not only on the method, but also on your mindset, whether you can overcome your human weaknesses, and whether you can steadfastly execute your investment plan.\nInvesting in index funds requires \u0026ldquo;patience\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;waiting,\u0026rdquo; the determination to \u0026ldquo;stay the course\u0026rdquo;, which is what most people lack.\n\u0026ldquo;Pits\u0026rdquo; on the Investment Path: Don\u0026rsquo;t Let These Traps Swallow Your Wealth # The path of investment is full of all sorts of \u0026ldquo;pits,\u0026rdquo; and one wrong step can lead to total ruin.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Financial Expert\u0026rdquo; Scam: Many so-called \u0026ldquo;financial experts\u0026rdquo; are actually just salespeople for financial products. In order to earn commissions, they will recommend various complex financial products to you, such as insurance, bonds, annuities, etc. These products often come with high fees and less-than-ideal long-term returns. Annuity products in particular, are not only low-yielding and high-risk, but also severely impact your asset allocation and tax planning. Remember, truly good investments are often simple, and those complicated products are often traps. Noise from the Media and \u0026ldquo;Experts\u0026rdquo;: Many media outlets and so-called \u0026ldquo;investment experts,\u0026rdquo; in order to grab attention, publish all sorts of sensational market predictions. One minute they\u0026rsquo;re saying a bull market is coming, the next a bear market is coming, and the next, that a certain industry is about to explode… This noise severely interferes with your judgment, making you unable to focus on long-term investment. Remember, what really matters is the long-term trend, not the short-term fluctuations. The Temptation of Short-Term Trading: Many people dream of getting rich overnight, so they like to buy and sell frequently, trying to capture every market fluctuation. However, short-term trading not only requires you to have superb skills and keen market intuition, but also to bear enormous risks. For ordinary investors, short-term trading is often not worth the effort, and can even lead to serious losses. Frequent trading is like a gambler in a casino, often eventually losing it all. The Risks of High Leverage: Some investors, in order to pursue higher returns, use excessive leverage, such as margin accounts. However, leverage is a double-edged sword, it can amplify your returns, but also amplify your losses. If used improperly, it can easily lead to total ruin, and even bankruptcy. Remember, the first priority of investment is to control risk, not to pursue high returns. Never put your fate in the hands of luck, especially not with leveraged fate. The Risk of Not Learning: Many people know nothing about investment. They don\u0026rsquo;t understand the essence of investment, nor their own risk tolerance, nor the characteristics of the products they are investing in. Such blind investment is like crossing the road with your eyes closed, full of risks. The Wisdom of \u0026ldquo;Buy When You Have Money\u0026rdquo;: Simple, Crude but Effective # \u0026ldquo;Buy when you have money.\u0026rdquo; These four words sound very simple, even a bit \u0026ldquo;silly,\u0026rdquo; right? But they are based on a deep understanding and insight into the long-term trends of the market.\nWe all know that the long-term trend of the market is upwards, driven by economic development and technological progress, and it\u0026rsquo;s an unstoppable historical trend. Although the market will fluctuate in the short term and even fall sharply, these are all temporary. In the long run, the market will always return to the upward trend and continue to reach new highs.\nMany people always want to buy at the lowest point and sell at the highest point. But ask yourself, do you really have the ability to do this? Not to mention ordinary investors, how many professional fund managers can actually do it?\nTrying to choose the best time to buy is often futile, even foolish, because no one can accurately predict market bottoms and tops. Instead of wasting a lot of time and energy researching market trends, it\u0026rsquo;s better to adopt a \u0026ldquo;buy when you have money\u0026rdquo; strategy, and use that time and energy to work and live life, enjoying life to the fullest.\nThe Determination to \u0026ldquo;Never Sell\u0026rdquo;: The Secret to Enduring Market Cycles # \u0026ldquo;Never sell,\u0026rdquo; these four words, don\u0026rsquo;t they sound a bit extreme? But they are the secret to enduring market cycles, the essence of long-term investing.\nThe essence of investing is to share in the growth dividends of excellent companies, not to gamble, in a casino, diving in and out. The logic behind \u0026ldquo;never sell\u0026rdquo; is actually very simple: as long as you are investing in excellent companies, and as long as you believe that these companies can continue to grow, then you should hold them for the long term, sharing in the dividends that their growth brings.\nFrequent buying and selling will not only increase your transaction costs, but will also cause you to miss out on the compounding effect of long-term holding. More importantly, it will expose you to human weaknesses.\nWhen the market is falling, you will feel panicked and will want to sell; when the market rises, you will become greedy and will want to chase after the price increases. As a result? You are often buying high and selling low, and are constantly harvested by the market.\nThe \u0026ldquo;never sell\u0026rdquo; strategy can help you overcome fear and greed, and allow you to always stay in the market, sharing in the dividends of economic growth.\nMarket Downturns: Be Greedy When Others are Fearful # Market downturns, for many people, are a nightmare, a disaster. But for true investors, they are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\nWhy is that? Because when the market is down, the stock prices of many high-quality companies will be severely undervalued, like a discounted sale, and buying at this time is like picking up a bargain.\nWarren Buffett once famously said, \u0026ldquo;Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.\u0026rdquo; This quote is about this very principle.\nMarket downturns are temporary, while the market\u0026rsquo;s long-term trend is upward. As long as you can overcome your fear and stick to your long-term investment strategy, you will be able to seize opportunities during market downturns, buy undervalued high-quality assets, and lay a solid foundation for future wealth growth.\n\u0026ldquo;Stock Pledges\u0026rdquo;: Make Your Assets More Flexible # The strategy of \u0026ldquo;living off stock pledges\u0026rdquo; can help you address your daily capital needs without selling your stock. This is a smarter way to manage finances.\nMany people might ask, what is a stock pledge? Simply put, it is using your stock as collateral to borrow money from a financial institution. In this way, you can gain access to liquidity without selling your stock, and you can continue to enjoy the long-term appreciation of your stock.\nThrough stock pledges, you can avoid being forced to sell stocks with long-term growth potential due to temporary funding shortages. Furthermore, in many countries and regions, the capital gains tax rate is usually higher than the borrowing interest rate. Through stock pledges, you can also reasonably reduce your tax burden.\nOf course, stock pledges also carry some risks. If the stock price drops sharply, you may need to provide additional collateral or face the risk of forced liquidation. Therefore, when using stock pledges, you must control your leverage ratio, and it is generally recommended that the pledge ratio not exceed 20% of your total assets.\nIndependent Thinking: Stay Clear-Headed in the Noisy Market # In this age of information overload, we are bombarded daily with all sorts of information, especially in the field of investment. The opinions of various \u0026ldquo;experts,\u0026rdquo; various media reports, and various rumors, are difficult to distinguish between true and false, making people dizzy.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have the ability to think independently, you can easily be swayed by this information and make wrong investment decisions.\nIndependent thinking is key to investment success. It means having your own judgment, not blindly following trends, not blindly believing in authority, and not being swayed by market sentiment.\nThe basis for independent thinking is learning and research. You need to continuously learn investment knowledge, study market laws, and understand the investment target. Only in this way can you form your own investment system and make correct decisions in the complex market environment.\nAlways remember that investment is your own business, and no one can make decisions for you.\nHow to Invest in NASDAQ 100 12 October 2024 Investing Finance QQQ Securities Account Opening Nasdaq 100 ","date":"5 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1736045402069/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"A One Hundred Million Investment Life Lecture","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"5 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/independent-thinking/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Independent Thinking","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/poor-mindset/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Poor Mindset","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/technology/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Technology","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/us-market/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"US Market","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2025-01-05","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E7%8B%AC%E7%AB%8B%E6%80%9D%E8%80%83/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"独立思考","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2025-01-05","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"科技","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2025-01-05","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E7%A9%B7%E4%BA%BA%E6%80%9D%E7%BB%B4/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"穷人思维","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2025-01-05","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"美国市场","type":"tags"},{"content":" I. Current Episode Theme # The theme of this episode is the global economic market analysis and investment strategy for 2025. The core idea is to hold high-quality assets for the long term, leveraging the power of compound interest to achieve wealth growth. It emphasizes the importance of strategies such as mindful spending, 442/433 asset allocation, and borrowing for investment, avoiding the trap of short-term market fluctuations and viewing investment with a long-term perspective.\nII. Briefing Content # Investment Market Analysis and Disclaimer # Don\u0026rsquo;t Overthink Market Volatility: It is emphasized that ordinary investors do not need to over-focus on global affairs, short-term market fluctuations, company financial reports, etc., as these factors have limited impact on long-term investments. It points out that investors who frequently engage in short-term trading often \u0026ldquo;pick up pennies and lose dollars,\u0026rdquo; wasting both time and life. CLEC\u0026rsquo;s Position: It is stated that CLEC (the club) is a non-profit investment and financial management channel that does not provide professional investment advisory services, nor does it receive any returns from members. Risk Warning: Investment involves risk; markets go up and down. Proceed with caution. Members need to conduct their own risk assessment and control and be responsible for their investment decisions. Importance of Asset Allocation: Over the past year, CLEC has continuously emphasized safe asset allocation, which is key to managing market risk and achieving steady long-term returns. Use of Video Resources: James has divided the four-hour-long video 00451 into short videos of about 15 minutes, making it easier for new members or those with limited time to learn. The short videos are subtitled in Chinese, English, and other languages to cater to members from different linguistic backgrounds. Investment Learning # Recommended Learning Videos: It is recommended that everyone watch video 00451 for systematic learning. If you have time, you can watch videos 00398 and 00288. It is emphasized that investing is a field of study that requires continuous learning and practice. Necessity of Learning for New Members: For new members who have just joined CLEC, James recommends that they take the time to watch previous videos and systematically learn CLEC\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy and strategies to avoid repeatedly asking questions or making incorrect investment decisions due to misunderstandings. Answering Complex Questions: Some complex questions cannot be explained clearly through simple messages or emails. These questions often require a comprehensive analysis combining multiple videos and strategies, which members need to learn systematically to grasp. Refusal to Do Out-of-Scope Simulations: James clearly states that he will not consider scenarios beyond situation 1 to situation 9, nor will he do simulations outside of CLEC\u0026rsquo;s investment framework for individual members. Global Investment Information: NASDAQ 100 index funds are available in many countries and regions around the world. James has compiled information from various locations into a document for members to easily access. Investment Context: It is emphasized that investments need to be viewed in the context of the current market, with a long-term perspective. It\u0026rsquo;s important to believe that the market will eventually rise, investments require patience, and wealth accumulation takes time, using time to reap the great benefits of compound interest. Investment Goals and Expectations # Wealth Goals: James believes that CLEC members should all be able to achieve assets of over a hundred million in their lifetime. If this goal is not reached, it indicates that something might have gone wrong in the investment process, requiring reflection and improvement. Moving Toward Higher Goals: James mentions that many members\u0026rsquo; assets have already exceeded one hundred million and are now moving toward the billion mark, which he is very pleased about. New Zealand Taxation and Investment Strategies # New Zealand Tax System: The tax system in New Zealand is similar to that in Australia. Even if stocks are not sold, tax is required on unrealized capital gains. Overseas Investment Tax: In New Zealand, unrealized capital gains from investments in overseas markets (such as buying US stocks like QQQ or NDQ) are subject to tax, with a high tax rate of 33% - 39%. Tax Avoidance Strategies: The USG fund issued in New Zealand may serve as a temporary tax avoidance measure, as investment in this fund may not require the payment of unrealized capital gains tax. ASB Securities Pledge: In New Zealand, ASB Securities can provide stock-pledged loans. The loan ratios vary depending on the fund. For example, some funds can borrow 65%, 70%, or even 50%. Investment and Consumption Concepts # Long-Term Investment Wealth Expectations: James uses data to show that if you have 1 million USD now, long-term investment might turn it into 200 million USD; if you have 10 million NTD now, it could become 2 billion NTD in the future. Advocating Spiritual Consumption: James encourages everyone to engage in spiritual consumption, which are consumptions that leave no material trace and cause no environmental pollution. For example, the enjoyment of staying in a good hotel for a few thousand dollars may be better than buying a useless decorative item, as material possessions become old, break down, and are eventually discarded over time. Choice of Transportation: Whether to take a 40-minute bus ride or drive a 20-minute car depends on which method makes you feel more comfortable and less anxious. If it doesn’t cause anxiety, it’s a good choice. Reducing Material Desires: We should think about “what can we do without” rather than “what do we want.” Reduce our dependence on material goods, avoid buying unnecessary or excessive items, and focus on basic life necessities, such as healthy food. Rational Shopping: When shopping, rationally assess the practical use of the item and avoid blindly following trends in consumption. Wealth Accumulation for Young People: Young people should try to reduce unnecessary spending and use the saved funds for investments to accumulate wealth more quickly. Pursuit of Spiritual Eternity: Our goal is to pursue spiritual and investment eternity. Reduce material desires, simplify life, and use money for things that can bring long-lasting spiritual enjoyment. Interpersonal Relationships and Life Planning # Finding Connections in Life: In the vast universe, we need to find connections with ourselves and others, especially when we are old and living alone. This connection can be marriage, partners, children, etc. About Giving Birth and Adoption: James suggests young members should either have or adopt children because we have sufficient financial resources to raise them, form families, and that it’s a human right, so they shouldn’t give up on it. Risks of Individual Stock Investment # Challenges for Retail Investors in Stock Picking: Retail investors picking individual stocks is like trying to find good fruit in a basket full of rotten fruit. The result is often that the more you pick, the more you mess things up. Importance of Cutting Losses: James uses the analogy of a broken elevator to illustrate that if an investment is losing money, it’s better to cut the loss and get on a different elevator (investment) rather than to continue waiting or trying to fix the broken one. When investment goes wrong, one should cut losses decisively instead of holding or averaging down. Capital Safety: James advises investors not to send funds overseas, but to keep them locally or in Hong Kong for capital safety. Don’t Blindly Pick Stocks: When individual investors can\u0026rsquo;t distinguish between good and bad stocks, they should avoid stock picking to prevent unnecessary losses. Acknowledging Limitations: Investors need to acknowledge their cognitive limitations and their ignorance; this is the essence of investment wisdom. Investment Advice for Taiwan # Cautious Cross-Border Investment: James points out that if stock investments in Taiwan are not performing well, it\u0026rsquo;s even more unwise to venture into overseas markets like the U.S., because competition in those markets is much more intense. Two Strategies to Address Losses: For investors who are losing money in Taiwan stock investments, James gives two pieces of advice: sell all individual stocks and buy 00662 ETF at market price, and hold for the long term; or sell all stocks and put funds in bank deposits, and exit the stock market entirely to avoid further losses. Contributions of Taiwanese Retail Investors: James points out that Taiwanese retail investors contribute over 150 billion NTD annually in transaction taxes to the government, so the government is motivated to encourage day trading and other short-term transactions. Borrowing for Investment Strategies # Application of Beta Coefficient: In the US, adjusting the portfolio\u0026rsquo;s beta coefficient to 1.2 is equivalent to using 20% leverage for investments. Order of Leverage Use: James suggests that investors first adjust the portfolio beta coefficient to 1.2, and then consider using credit, mortgages, and other forms of leverage. Post-Borrowing Investment Strategy: After borrowing, it is still recommended to invest according to the 442/433 asset allocation ratio. Opposing Opportunism: James points out that some investors are always looking for various investment techniques or shortcuts instead of learning diligently, which is not recommended. He emphasizes that there are no shortcuts in investing; only through systematic learning and practice can one grasp the correct investment methods. Property Investment vs. Renting # Long-Term Returns on Property Investment: James uses a property worth 5 million USD as an example. If this money is invested and has an annualized return rate of 14%, it could grow to 1 billion USD after 40 years, and save the 40 years of potential mortgage repayments and property maintenance fees. Financial Cost of Renting: If you pay 15,000 USD in rent per month, the total amount repaid in 40 years will be as high as 22 million USD. Depreciation Risks of Property: A house built 60 years ago may no longer be habitable. Similarly, a house purchased now may face the same problem in 60 years. In contrast, renting allows the flexibility to choose appropriate housing based on changing needs. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Brian # Sharing 1: Convenience of Having Funds. Brian shared his experience of seeing a dentist in Taiwan. Since he had ample funds, he could pay in cash, unlike some people with limited finances who might experience delays due to cash flow issues. He felt the convenience of having funds.\nJames\u0026rsquo;s comment: Agreed with Brian\u0026rsquo;s point, stating that \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s really good to have money\u0026rdquo; as it can solve many problems and can even \u0026ldquo;buy\u0026rdquo; better relationships. Sharing 2: Taiwan Living Experience. Brian chose to stay at a hotel instead of with his parents when returning to Taiwan. He felt that staying at a hotel offered more freedom and fewer constraints. Furthermore, when eating out, he could pay for himself instead of his parents or in-laws, which gave him a sense of financial independence and control.\nJames\u0026rsquo;s comment: Suggests that family gatherings in Taiwan can be held in hotels, and if family members are willing, they can also stay at the hotel together, using money to obtain a more comfortable living environment and a higher quality of life. Sharing 3: Fund Allocation and Investment Strategies. Brian re-adjusted his fund allocation based on James’s investment philosophy. He found that even in the worst market conditions (e.g., a 20% market drop), his funds were still safe. He used funds from broker loans and investment returns and calculated that even after retirement, if he continues to invest a fixed amount each year, his “visualization rate” would not be lower than 200%. He believes the Excel spreadsheets provided by James are very helpful for understanding how funds grow and managing asset allocation.\nJames\u0026rsquo;s comment: Affirming Brian\u0026rsquo;s approach. Sharing 4: Building Confidence in Borrowing for Investment. Brian believes that if he never uses borrowing, he might feel psychological resistance when he actually needs to use it. Therefore, he started to try using broker loans and considered reinvesting the borrowed funds. He believes that practical operation can help better understand how to use borrowing and find the most suitable way.\nJames\u0026rsquo;s comment: Shared his own experience, that he uses borrowed money as much as possible, rather than spending his own money, when travelling or eating out. He emphasizes that his assets will never be spent, and any income will immediately be used to buy QQQ. He further explains that buying 00662 actually helps the Taiwan Central Bank activate its foreign exchange reserves, reduce inflationary pressure, and also activate idle capital in Taiwan. However, safe asset allocation is a prerequisite for borrowing to invest. Without understanding safe asset allocation, one cannot use this tool. Question 1: Regarding his fund allocation, should he put QQQ and QLD into a Roth IRA, and then use the borrowed funds for other investments, such as buying TQQQ, and whether his current fund allocation is reasonable and carries any risks?\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nRegarding Asset Allocation: Brian\u0026rsquo;s current approach is to invest some funds in QQQ, some in QLD (2x leveraged QQQ), and keep some in cash. James points out that when Brian\u0026rsquo;s retirement account doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much money, it is not very efficient or risk-free to pledge and put the money in the broker investment account, and to use leveraged funds (such as QLD). Risk of Black Swan Events: James emphasizes that Brian needs to have sufficient cash, exceeding the amount of his brokerage loans. This is to prevent \u0026ldquo;black swan events,\u0026rdquo; i.e., unpredictable major risk events. Recommended Asset Allocation: James suggests Brian puts QQQ and QLD into his Roth IRA account, and either keeps the traditional IRA account as cash or keeps enough cash in his brokerage account, ensuring that the cash amount exceeds the borrowed amount. Regarding 442/433 Allocation: James further explains that 442 and 433 are just references, and the specific asset allocation ratio needs to be adjusted according to individual situations. He emphasizes several key principles: have enough cash, and have more cash than borrowed money; the ratio of leveraged funds should not exceed the ratio of the original funds (such as QQQ). For young people, they can do a 442 allocation at the highest, meaning the ratio of leveraged funds and original funds are the same. Post-Allocation Adjustments: James points out that after allocating assets according to the 442 ratio, the ratio of leveraged funds will automatically increase as the market rises, which is normal. Because assets are increasing, and cash is also increasing, the overall safety is actually much higher than the beginning. Peter # Sharing 1: Book Recommendations. Peter recommended two investment and financial management books: \u0026ldquo;The Long Game\u0026rdquo; by Nick Maggiulli and \u0026ldquo;Atomic Habits\u0026rdquo; by James Clear. He believes that many of the ideas in these books are very similar to James\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy.\nJames\u0026rsquo;s comment: Stated that the content of the books was similar to the investment concepts they discussed, and if anyone has time, they should read them as there is a lot of data that can verify our previous viewpoints. Sharing 2: Building a Habit of Borrowing for Investment. Peter shared his experience with borrowing for investment, believing that it\u0026rsquo;s a habit that needs to be cultivated. Only by being accustomed to this operation will one not feel unfamiliar or resistant to borrowing when assets reach a certain scale (e.g., 1 million, 2 million). Peter also mentioned that in the investment process, you need to construct two curves in your mind: one is the total assets curve rising, and the other is the total liabilities curve also rising, but the slope of the total liabilities curve should be less than that of the total assets curve. This way, assets will increase over time, while the proportion of liabilities will decrease.\nSharing 3: Negotiating Lower Loan Interest Rates with Banks. Peter shared his experience negotiating lower loan interest rates with the bank. He mentioned that loan interest rates can be negotiated with the bank. He personally called the bank and successfully lowered his loan interest rate by 0.7%. He encourages everyone to not be afraid to try, to take the initiative to communicate with the bank, and to fight for lower loan interest rates.\nSharing 4: Understanding \u0026ldquo;Owning Equity Means Owning the World.\u0026rdquo; Peter expressed that he was impressed with James\u0026rsquo;s idea that \u0026ldquo;when you own equity assets in Wall Street stocks, you own the world,\u0026rdquo; and the idea of \u0026ldquo;never sell assets.\u0026rdquo; He now understands the importance of owning equity assets and the meaning of long-term holdings.\nSharing 5: Importance of Spiritual Consumption. Peter highly agreed with the concept of \u0026ldquo;spiritual consumption\u0026rdquo; put forth by James. He believes that traveling, good food, having more children, and being present in their growth, are all good forms of spiritual consumption.\nTerry # Question 1: Regarding funds management in Roth IRA and investment accounts. Terry mentioned that he has 401k, Roth IRA, and brokerage accounts in the US. He wants to know if he can use leverage in a Roth IRA account, and whether he must borrow via his brokerage investment account.\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nRestrictions on Retirement Accounts: James clearly stated that retirement accounts (such as 401k, Roth IRA) cannot be used as collateral, meaning one cannot use assets in retirement accounts to borrow. Only assets in a broker\u0026rsquo;s investment account can be pledged for loans. Role of IRA Assets: James explained that while IRA assets cannot be used directly to pledge for borrowing, the amount of assets affects the interest rates of the loan. When brokers evaluate the borrower\u0026rsquo;s overall financial situation, they consider the assets in the IRA account, which might lead to more favorable interest rates. However, the amount of assets in an IRA account does not determine how much can be borrowed. Calculating Loan Amounts and Interest Rates: James explained how loan amounts and interest rates are calculated. The amount that can be borrowed is usually 60% to 70% of the assets in the investment account. The interest rate on the loan is determined by a combination of factors, including the base lending rate, the size of assets in the investment account, and the size of assets in retirement accounts such as IRA. Question 2: Can one increase income by selling Covered Calls for QQQ?\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nOpposing Covered Call Strategy: James explicitly opposed the Covered Call strategy that Terry suggested. He believes the strategy is not necessary and carries high risks. Risks of Covered Call: James explained that if a Covered Call strategy is used and the market suddenly rises significantly, the options would most likely be exercised, forcing the investor to sell QQQ at the agreed price (usually below market price), thus missing out on the profits from the rise. Alternatively, the investor would need to pay more funds to repurchase QQQ. Jason # Sharing: Recognition of CLEC and James\u0026rsquo;s Investment Philosophy. Jason first expressed his gratitude to CLEC and James, believing that they bring surprises each year. From the initial advice of \u0026ldquo;sell individual stocks, sell actively managed funds, and go all-in on QQQ\u0026rdquo; to last year\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;asset allocation,\u0026rdquo; this year\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;continuous optimization of asset allocation,\u0026rdquo; and now the \u0026ldquo;442\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;433\u0026rdquo; allocation, James\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy and strategies are constantly evolving and improving. This has helped investors avoid external interference and truly achieve \u0026ldquo;not being overjoyed by external gains, and not being saddened by external losses.\u0026rdquo;\nQuestion 1: When doing a \u0026ldquo;smart rebalancing\u0026rdquo; of asset allocation, if the predetermined ratios are not met, for example, if the ratio of leveraged funds has not yet reached the requirement of a \u0026ldquo;433\u0026rdquo; allocation, is it still necessary to perform \u0026ldquo;smart rebalancing?\u0026rdquo;\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nTrigger Conditions for Rebalancing: James explained that if the ratio of leveraged funds has not reached the predetermined target, for example, the 442 ratio, there is no need to do \u0026ldquo;smart rebalancing\u0026rdquo; for the time being. You can wait until the ratio reaches or exceeds the predetermined target before adjusting. Question 2: Regarding how to solve children\u0026rsquo;s university tuition fees. Jason mentioned that university fees in the US are very high, especially for out-of-state students, where tuition and living expenses could reach 100,000 USD annually. Some of his friends are considering \u0026ldquo;hiding\u0026rdquo; some funds, such as by purchasing annuities, insurance, or transferring funds to others\u0026rsquo; names to apply for student aid to alleviate financial burdens. He would like to know what advice James has on this matter.\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nOpposing the Practice of \u0026ldquo;Hiding Money\u0026rdquo;: James strongly opposed the practice of \u0026ldquo;hiding\u0026rdquo; funds to save on university fees. He believes this practice is counterproductive and may even be illegal. Disadvantages of Annuities and Insurance: James pointed out that investing funds in annuities or insurance may reduce the amount of assets needed for disclosure in the short term, potentially qualifying for more student aid. However, it results in a huge loss of investment returns in the long term. He uses an example of 500,000 USD; if that amount was used for investments with an annual return of 14%, it could grow to 1.3 billion USD in 60 years. Whereas if that money is invested in annuities or insurance, the rate of return would be much lower, and the liquidity of the funds would be restricted. Legal Risks of \u0026ldquo;Hiding Money\u0026rdquo;: James specifically emphasized that transferring funds to others\u0026rsquo; names, for example, to parents in China, and then having parents send funds back to the US annually, is suspected of money laundering and fraud, which is a serious criminal act in the United States. If discovered, there are severe consequences. Suggested Practice: James suggested that instead of \u0026ldquo;hiding money,\u0026rdquo; the money should be used for investments to grow the wealth. Even if one does not help their children pay for university fees, children can apply for student loans themselves. When they graduate and the assets have grown in value, one can use that to help repay the loans. Other Options: James also mentioned that children can earn some of their living expenses by working part-time or at a side job, such as driving a rideshare or doing other small part-time jobs, where they can earn tens of thousands of USD each year. Opa # Sharing 1: Personal Investment Experience and Confidence. Opa shared his experience of going all-in on QQQ. He bought it at the peak of the market, and although it declined for some time, his investment recovered to the previous high by the first half of this year and is now highly profitable. This experience has given him great confidence in long-term investments and a deeper understanding of bear markets.\nSharing 2: Daughter\u0026rsquo;s Investment Experience and Transformation. Opa mentioned that his daughter previously had more faith in her financial advisor, and had given the advisor more than 1 million USD to manage. However, the advisor\u0026rsquo;s investment strategy was too diversified, allocating assets across 20-30 ETFs, covering various indexes and small-cap stocks, which resulted in poor overall returns. Opa had been trying to persuade his daughter to change her investment strategy, but she would not listen. It was not until recently, after having two children, that she began to reconsider due to increased financial pressure. At a Christmas family gathering, Opa once again explained the power of compounding and the impact of the technology sector on productivity to his daughter. His daughter finally understood the importance of long-term and focused investments and plans to transfer about 2 million USD to a broker account that allows stock pledges.\nQuestion 1: Regarding the loan interest rate on 2 million USD in a broker account. Opa mentioned that according to the broker’s website, the loan interest rates for 2 million USD is still very high. He would like to know how to get a lower interest rate, and whether the loan interest rate is calculated based on total assets or the actual amount of the loan.\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nNegotiating Lower Interest Rates: James first pointed out that loan interest rates can be negotiated with the broker. He suggests that Opa\u0026rsquo;s daughter directly contact the broker and ask for a lower rate. Interest Rate Calculation Methods: James explained that brokers take a number of factors into consideration when assessing the loan interest rate, including the borrower\u0026rsquo;s total assets, loan amount, and duration of the loan. Generally, the larger the total asset, the smaller the loan amount as a percentage of the total asset, and the longer the loan duration, the lower the interest rate. Interest Rate for 2 Million: James estimated the loan interest rate that Opa\u0026rsquo;s daughter could receive based on her situation. He mentioned that the base rate announced on the broker\u0026rsquo;s website was just a benchmark, and the actual rate would require further negotiations. He recommends that Opa\u0026rsquo;s daughter directly contact the broker\u0026rsquo;s staff member, Lisa, for a more detailed consultation. He also provided a calculation formula: 2.9% - 0.5% = 2.4%. 2.9% is the base interest rate for a 2 million loan in the brokerage, and 0.5% is the discount that Opa\u0026rsquo;s daughter could get based on the size of her assets. Question 2: Regarding how to perform asset allocation. Opa’s current asset allocation is 811, which means 80% QQQ, 10% QLD, and 10% Cash. His goal is to adjust the asset allocation to 442, which means 40% QQQ, 40% QLD, and 20% Cash. He wants to know if it’s better to put leveraged assets (such as QLD) in the Roth IRA account, and the normal account in cash plus QQQ, to better maintain the correct ratio of the standard account during a bear market. Also, if there is a \u0026ldquo;perfect\u0026rdquo; asset allocation plan, should all the funds in the Roth IRA be allocated to QLD, and the normal account to cash plus QQQ?\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nInterpretation of 811 Allocation: James first interpreted the meaning of the 811 allocation and said that there is nothing wrong with the allocation approach. View on \u0026ldquo;Perfect\u0026rdquo; Allocation: James believes that if one only has a Roth IRA account and a normal account, then it is acceptable to allocate all of the Roth IRA funds to QLD and allocate the normal account to cash plus QQQ. Flexibility of Asset Allocation: James emphasizes that the specific asset allocation ratio should be adjusted based on individual situations. For example, it depends on the percentage of total assets that the Roth IRA account represents. If the Roth IRA account represents 40% of the total asset, then all the funds in the Roth IRA account can be allocated to QLD to reach the 442 allocation target. However, if the Roth IRA funds only account for a smaller percentage, say 20% or 30%, then the 442 target allocation cannot be reached, and the allocation will most likely be 622. Leverage Choices: James also mentioned that if one hopes to increase the percentage of the Roth IRA account to 40%, one can consider using 3x leveraged ETFs such as TQQQ. Question 3: Regarding the use of funds in his 401k account. Opa mentioned that he and his wife\u0026rsquo;s 401k accounts are still in their respective company plans and cannot be rolled over until they reach the age of 65 (still two years away). He would like to know how to manage these funds now.\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nAllocating Cash to the 401k Account: James recommended that Opa allocate cash to his 401k account, because the 401k account usually has some tax-saving policies. Keeping cash in the 401k account can take full advantage of these policies. Regarding QQQ’s Long-Term Investment Returns: James shared some data regarding QQQ’s long-term investment returns. He pointed out that QQQ’s annualized return over the last 5 years is approximately 19%, the annualized return over the last 10 years is approximately 17%, and the annualized return over the last 20 years is approximately 14%. He also points out that QQQ is accelerating human growth, and its future return might be higher and higher, therefore investments must be made. Young # Sharing 1: Observations and Reflections on Social Phenomena. Young shared an observation she made at work and in her life: many people work very hard in their respective fields and put in a lot of time and energy, whether it\u0026rsquo;s running a business, working at a job. However, they do not give much importance to how they manage their money, or they don\u0026rsquo;t know how to make effective investments. Young believes this might be because they do not understand investments, or they do not realize the importance of investments. She emphasizes that as long as one has the correct investment methods, they can achieve greater freedom in their work and life.\nSharing 2: Risks of Insurance Products. Young has worked in the insurance industry for many years. She has come in contact with many clients and has seen many unreasonable insurance products. She gave a specific example: a client paid 500,000 RMB in insurance premiums every year for three years, totaling 1.5 million RMB. It has been 8 years now, and some years ago, this client borrowed over 800,000 RMB due to a cash shortage. If the client now wants to withdraw the policy, after deducting the borrowed amount, he can only get back 300,000 RMB. That is to say, he would still lose money. In addition, the client has never paid any interest on the loan. Young points out that the interest rate on policy loans in China is often 5%, while the return on the policy is only 3%. This means the interest paid annually by clients is far higher than the returns provided by the insurance company.\nSharing 3: Agreement with James\u0026rsquo;s Investment Philosophy. Young stated that she agrees with James\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy, especially the point that \u0026ldquo;you shouldn’t try to make money that isn’t necessary.\u0026rdquo; She believes that we should focus our primary time and energy on our work and lives, instead of spending a lot of time researching investment products such as stocks and funds. All one needs to do is to hold long-term investments in the stocks of the world\u0026rsquo;s best 100 companies, and then spend more time enhancing our spiritual energy, being with our families, and enjoying life.\nQuestion: Regarding the risks for clients opening an account in Hong Kong to purchase US Treasury bonds. Young mentioned that the interest rates on Chinese government bonds are very low, at about 1.6%, while the interest rates on US Treasury bonds are as high as 4.6%. Some people she knows are recommending that Chinese clients open bank accounts in Hong Kong, then exchange RMB into USD to purchase 5 or 10 year US Treasury bonds. She would like to know what risks are involved in such operations.\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nNeed to Understand Specific Operational Details: James first pointed out that he would need to understand more specific operation details before he can assess the risks involved. He specifically mentioned that the normal procedure for treasury bonds does not require going through an insurance company, and he was unclear about the specific procedure and organizations involved in purchasing US treasury bonds, therefore he cannot provide concrete suggestions. Doubts Regarding \u0026ldquo;High Returns\u0026rdquo;: James expressed doubts about this kind of \u0026ldquo;high return\u0026rdquo; investment method. He believes that if there really was such a good investment opportunity, the insurance company\u0026rsquo;s own funds would be invested, instead of recommending it to clients. He reminds everyone not to easily trust the so-called high-return and low-risk investment products, because there are often unknown risks behind them. Wave # Question 1: Regarding asset allocation after retirement and calculating amounts for pledging and borrowing. Wave mentioned that she is planning to retire this year, and she would like to know whether she can pledge her stocks to borrow funds after retirement, and how to calculate the amount that can be borrowed. She also mentioned that her 30 year-old son would like to understand the issues of pledging and loans, and how to explain the methods of calculation to him, and where to find relevant information.\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nAsset Allocation after Retirement: James first introduced two different methods of asset allocation after retirement: Not Pledging and Borrowing: If you are not planning to pledge and borrow funds, you can allocate 80% of your assets to QQQ and 20% to cash. Each year, you can use the cash part to pay living expenses, and rebalance at the end of the year, re-adjusting the ratio back to 80% and 20%. Pledging and Borrowing: If you plan to pledge and borrow funds, then you should adopt the 433 method of asset allocation, which means 40% QQQ, 30% QLD (2x leverage QQQ), 30% cash (or money market fund). Each year, you can borrow 2% of your total asset for living expenses, and also rebalance at the end of the year. Calculating Loan Amounts: James explained that the amount that can be borrowed depends on total assets and the type of asset. Generally, about 60%-70% of the total assets can be borrowed. However, different types of assets will have different ratios. For example, the amount that can be borrowed from QQQ is about 70%, while the amount that can be borrowed from cash and money market funds such as SWVXX can be as high as 96%. Regarding the Choice Between 442 and 433: James points out that for young people, 442 and 433 are both acceptable asset allocation options. The 442 allocation can achieve higher expected returns, but the risk is also comparatively higher; the 433 allocation is more stable. He suggests that Wave\u0026rsquo;s son choose the allocation method most suitable for his personal risk tolerance and investment goals. If one plans to do pledging from the very start, 433 allocation can be considered, because the taxes paid will be less when making changes to the assets. Regarding Learning Resources: James told Wave that he had organized and provided all of the articles and video links that covered the topics of asset allocation and pledging stock for loans, and she can find details on calculation methods and operation guides from these resources. Question 2: Regarding the view that “the estate will only be 1 million.” Wave mentioned that she recently saw a video by James that mentioned “the estate will only be 1 million in the future,” which moved her greatly. She believes that if one can increase one\u0026rsquo;s wealth via borrowing for investment, and use that wealth for helping others during one\u0026rsquo;s lifetime, that would be very meaningful.\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nExplaining \u0026ldquo;Estate Will Only Be 1 Million\u0026rdquo;: James explained that it does not actually mean that only 1 million will be left to the children as an estate, but that one should use investment loans to make the most of one\u0026rsquo;s assets, so that one can do more meaningful things with the funds, instead of leaving all of the wealth to the children. He used an example of 300 million in assets. If 290 million are borrowed out, only 1 million will be left, but the 300 million in assets, and the 290 million in liabilities, can still be transferred to the children, and they can use that borrowed money and the rest of the assets. Regarding Estate Planning: James also mentioned that in order to avoid high estate taxes, one can consider establishing a trust, and transferring assets into that trust, similar to how Buffet and Bill Gates do it. Julia (Continued) # Question 1: Regarding the calculation and negotiation of interest rates on stock-pledged loans, and the impact of retirement account assets on borrowing rates.\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nInterest Calculation: James explained that interest on stock-pledged loans consists of two parts: a fixed spread (also called fixed interest rate spread, which depends on the broker and borrower’s creditworthiness) and a floating rate (usually referencing SOFR, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate). For a loan of 1 million, if the fixed spread is 4%, the total borrowing rate may reach about 8% when combined with the floating rate. Interest Rate Negotiation: James emphasized that loan interest rates are negotiable with the broker. He advises Julia to proactively communicate with the broker to negotiate a lower rate. Impact of Retirement Account Assets: James pointed out that while assets in retirement accounts (such as IRA, 401k) cannot be directly pledged for loans, the amount of these assets impacts the borrowing rate. When assessing the borrower’s overall repayment ability and risk status, brokers will consider the assets in retirement accounts. If the assets in retirement accounts are substantial, the borrower might qualify for more favorable interest rates. Question 2: After opening an account, can one apply for a stock-pledged loan immediately? Will the borrowing limit be adjusted annually?\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nApply Immediately: James confirmed that one can apply for a stock-pledged loan immediately after opening an account. Limit Adjustments: James explained that the borrowing limit is calculated based on the asset value of the account, which will fluctuate with market conditions. Therefore, the borrowing limit is not fixed but is dynamically adjusted according to the market. Question 3: If there are investment losses, will the borrowing limit decrease?\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nYes: James clearly pointed out that if there are investment losses, leading to a decline in the account asset value, the borrowing limit will decrease accordingly. He gave an example: If there were originally 1 million in assets, the borrowing limit may be 700,000. If there was a loss of 300,000, leaving 700,000, the borrowing limit would become 490,000 (70% of 700,000). Brokers will re-calculate the borrowing limit based on the updated net asset value. Dynamic Adjustment of Borrowing Limits: James emphasized that brokers dynamically adjust the borrowing limit based on the real-time value of the assets in the account. This means if there are investment losses, the borrowing limit decreases. If there are investment profits, the borrowing limit increases. Question 4: What is the difference between stock-pledged loans and margin?\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nInterest Costs: James pointed out that the interest on margin loans is usually higher than that on stock-pledged loans. Risk of Forced Liquidation: James explained that both margin and stock-pledged loans carry the risk of forced liquidation. However, margin has a stricter forced liquidation mechanism. When the net asset value of the account falls below a certain maintenance margin ratio, the broker will immediately force liquidation to recover the loan. Stock-pledged loans have a relatively more lenient forced liquidation mechanism. Brokers may give the borrower some buffer time or communicate with the borrower before forcing liquidation. Overall, the forced liquidation risk of margin loans is higher. Question 5: After borrowing funds, can they be used for investment?\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nNo: James stated clearly that using borrowed money to reinvest in the stock market is illegal. He emphasized that brokers usually specify in the loan agreements that the loan cannot be used to purchase stocks or other investment products. Risks of Violations: James explained that brokers can monitor the flow of funds, and although it may not immediately trigger forced liquidation, if such activities are discovered, it may lead to the account being frozen and loans being recalled with severe consequences. Recommendations: James advises members to strictly comply with the broker’s regulations and use the borrowed funds for consumption or other non-investment purposes. Shawn # Question 1: Regarding the calculation of borrowing limits under a 433 asset allocation. Shawn mentioned that he is currently using a 433 asset allocation, which means 40% QQQ, 30% QLD (2x leveraged QQQ), and 30% cash. He would like to know if, when calculating his borrowing limits, the broker also includes the QLD component.\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nQLD is Not Included: James clearly stated that in a 433 allocation, the broker does not include QLD when calculating the borrowing limit. This means only the QQQ and cash parts are used to calculate the borrowing limit. Specific Calculation: James provided an example: If Shawn has 1 million in total assets, and the 433 allocation is 400,000 in QQQ, 300,000 in QLD, and 300,000 in cash, the amount that can be borrowed is 70% of the 400,000 in QQQ, which is 280,000, plus 96% of the 300,000 in cash (assuming the borrowing ratio for cash or money market funds such as SWVXX is 96%), which is 288,000. Combined, the total amount that can be borrowed is 568,000. Significance of the 433 Allocation: James explained that the significance of the 433 allocation lies in its balance of returns and risks. By allocating a certain percentage of leveraged funds (such as QLD), the expected return of the overall investment portfolio can be increased. At the same time, allocating a certain percentage of cash can reduce the risk of the investment portfolio and provide a buffer during market declines. Question 2: If the 433 allocation method is used and the total asset is 1 million, then borrowing 2% annually (20,000) may not be enough for retirement.\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\n1 Million in Assets Not Enough for Retirement: James agreed with Shawn’s point. He pointed out that if the total assets is only 1 million, even if 2% is borrowed annually, that would only be 20,000, which would not be enough for retirement. 433 Allocation is for Total Assets: James emphasized that the 433 allocation is with regard to the total assets, not a single account. He advises Shawn to include all assets, including retirement accounts (such as IRA, 401k) and non-retirement accounts, in the 433 asset allocation framework. Allocation Across Different Accounts: James advises that QQQ and QLD should be allocated primarily to retirement accounts, because retirement accounts usually have tax benefits, allowing for tax deferral, thus enhancing the effect of compounding returns. The cash portion should primarily be allocated to non-retirement accounts to allow for ease of access when needed. Question 3: Concerned about the possibility of hacking or accidental errors leading to the sale of QQQ; is there a way to restrict the selling of QQQ in the account?\nJames\u0026rsquo;s Response:\nAccount Security Concerns: James stated he understands Shawn\u0026rsquo;s concern because long-term holdings of QQQ, once sold, would lead to large tax burdens. Possibility of Restricting Selling: James said that he is not certain whether there is a function that directly restricts the selling of a specific stock in the account, as he does not work at a brokerage and is unclear about the specific operation permissions and function settings. However, he advises Shawn to contact the broker directly (for example, Lisa, whom he recommended) and inquire if they have the relevant settings or services. Strengthening Account Security: James emphasized that protecting the account is very important. He advised Shawn to take actions to strengthen the security level of the account, such as using a strong password, enabling two-factor authentication, and using a hardware security key. IV. Key Insights # Investing requires learning, new members need to watch previous videos to learn systematically. \u0026ndash; James\nThe background of this idea is the influx of new members, who are asking many questions that have already been answered in previous videos. Therefore new members need systematic learning. Acknowledging one’s own ignorance is power, and ignorance is wisdom. \u0026ndash; James\nThe reason why many retail investors lose money is that they are overconfident, trade frequently, chase highs and sell lows, and cannot understand the essence of the market. Acknowledging one\u0026rsquo;s cognitive limitations is necessary to avoid making rash decisions, and to make more rational investment decisions. It’s great to have money, you can use it to resolve worries, and to buy relationships. \u0026ndash; James\nThis is based on Brian’s sharing of his experiences after gaining financial independence, and his ability to spend his own money, and treat his family, which gave him more freedom and control. It shows the conveniences that money provides. Humanity is growing at an accelerating pace, and investment returns will get higher and higher. \u0026ndash; James\nThis conclusion is based on data on QQQ\u0026rsquo;s past 20 years of investment returns, and emphasizes the effects of compound interest due to technological developments. Long-term investment in high-quality assets that are representative of the direction of technological development allows one to share the bonuses of human progress. Encourage borrowing for investment, leave only 1 million in the estate, show respect. \u0026ndash; James\nThis is based on long-term investments, compounding returns, and sensible asset allocation, allowing one to maximize wealth, and to use loans to enhance one\u0026rsquo;s quality of life, or to help others. With sensible asset allocation, loans for investment can accelerate the growth of wealth, and not simply accumulating wealth to leave to the next generation. There are no shortcuts in investing, only through systematic learning and practice can one master correct investment methods. \u0026ndash; James\nThis is a message to those who are trying to find investment skills and shortcuts, but are unwilling to learn systematically. Investing is a complex field of study that requires continuous learning and practice in order to improve one\u0026rsquo;s investment expertise. When you own equity assets in Wall Street stocks, you own the world. \u0026ndash; James\nThis is an emphasis on the importance of long-term holdings of high-quality equity assets. Stocks are not merely an investment tool, but also represent ownership of a company. By holding the stocks of the world’s best companies, one can share in the wealth generated by these companies worldwide. Don’t try to make money that isn’t necessary. \u0026ndash; James\nThis is to advise investors not to over-pursue short-term gains while overlooking the value of long-term investing. We should focus our main time and energy on our work and lives, instead of spending too much time researching short-term market fluctuations or attempting to earn the difference by trading frequently. The numbers 442 and 433 are merely references, and the specific asset allocation ratio must be adjusted according to individual situations. \u0026ndash; James\nThis is to emphasize the flexibility and personalization of asset allocation. Each person has a different risk tolerance, investment goals, capital size, etc., and therefore, they need to devise the appropriate asset allocation plan based on their actual situation. Protecting account security is very important. \u0026ndash; James\nThis reminds investors to take account security seriously, and to take the necessary actions to prevent the account from being stolen or accidentally mishandled. Because if this occurs, it will lead to severe losses, and especially for long-term held assets, the losses would be even greater. V. Summary # This episode focuses on long-term investment, asset allocation, borrowing for investment, and investment mindset. James emphasizes the importance of holding high-quality assets for the long term and the core idea of using compound interest to achieve wealth growth. He also explains the 442/433 asset allocation strategies in detail, as well as the precautions and operational methods for borrowing for investment. At the same time, he analyzes and explains some common investment misconceptions, such as over-focusing on short-term market fluctuations, blindly seeking high returns, ignoring risk control, and lacking investment knowledge and experience. In addition, James also shares some practical investment tools and methods, such as how to leverage brokerage resources, how to negotiate loan interest rates with the broker, and how to enhance account security.\nIn summary, this episode is full of useful content and a great deal of information, providing in-depth exploration of all aspects of long-term investing. It is highly valuable for those who wish to achieve wealth growth through long-term investing, and also for those who wish to enhance their investment expertise.\nDisclaimer: This article is for personal learning notes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Topic of the Session # Investment mindset and strategy adjustments amidst year-end market volatility, along with comprehensive reflections on personal life and financial health.\nII. Presentation Content # Market Volatility and Investment Mindset # The only constant in the market is volatility. Investors should ignore market fluctuations, international situations, market analysis, financial reports, and economic situations, and focus on long-term investment. Disclaimer: The content of the COC investment and financial management channel is for educational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. Investment involves high risks, and proper asset allocation is necessary. Newcomers should watch the YouTube episode 00451 \u0026ldquo;Investment Lecture Worth 100 Million\u0026rdquo; and also find related content on Bilibili and podcasts. Investing requires independent thinking. Do not blindly follow advice or join any groups to avoid being deceived. The Nasdaq 100 index fund is recommended as the only focused fund, with others being supplementary. The handout includes information on Nasdaq 100 index funds worldwide, including leveraged funds, and information on retirement accounts in various regions, with content continuously updated. The \u0026ldquo;Investment Lecture Worth 100 Million\u0026rdquo; video is the most important. Investors should always be extremely optimistic; the market will eventually rise and reach new highs. UK and European Financial Information # Showcasing information provided by a UK friend regarding UK investments, loans, retirement accounts, ETFs, and insurance companies, particularly information on 2x leveraged funds on the PEA website. US-China Trade War and Globalization # Issues like the US-China trade war and tariffs do not affect technological advancements and the innovation of American companies, thus having little impact on index investing. Risks and Returns of Leveraged Funds # The risk of a 2x leveraged fund is not simply double, and the return is not twice the annualized rate of return, but approximately 1.4 times. The annualized return of QQQ over 20 years is 14%, while QLD\u0026rsquo;s is 19.6%. QLD\u0026rsquo;s total return over 20 years is 2.6 times that of QQQ, far exceeding double. Combining leveraged funds with cash can reduce risk and increase returns. Investment Wisdom and Market Essence # The market is always smarter than individual investors. Stock picking and timing the market are futile. In a bull market, many \u0026ldquo;gurus\u0026rdquo; emerge, but they disappear when the market falls; this is a market norm. Controlling the major stocks on Wall Street means controlling the world. Investment Sharing and Personal Insights # Investment sharers need to provide clear, diverse, and universally applicable investment methods and benefit from them. Buffett\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy emphasizes long-term investment, perfecting the investment system. Understanding the essence of finance, economics, accounting, and logic helps resist external interference and adhere to index investing. Asset allocation is simplified into two types: 433 (conservative) and 442 (aggressive), pursuing safety rather than high returns, with cash being a safe asset. Finance and Monetary Theory # The foundation of capitalism is currency. Understanding monetary theory is crucial to understanding finance, investment, and the economy. The status of the US dollar as the world\u0026rsquo;s reserve currency determines the subordinate status of other countries, especially those holding large amounts of US dollar foreign exchange reserves. China and other emerging countries are trying to break away from their dependence on the US dollar to escape US control. Life\u0026rsquo;s Meaning and Happiness # The happiest thing in life is giving. Happiness is a human right. Sharing and giving energy on a spiritual level can bring more happiness than material things. Extremes of Capitalism and Social Issues # Capitalism will lead to an expansion of the wealth gap. The development of robots will make spiritual education even more important. Systemic discrimination exists in society, leading to a vicious cycle of poverty. Our goal is to help eliminate poverty as much as possible. US Accounting System and Social Phenomena # The US accounting system is very complete. Phenomena like \u0026ldquo;zero-dollar shopping\u0026rdquo; are the result of accounting costs and leftist thinking, and there is no need to over-interpret them. Wealth and Government Relations # Wealthy individuals escape government control by paying taxes, while the poor are trapped. Legitimate tax avoidance is an important topic. Personalization of Diet and Asset Allocation # Both diet and asset allocation should be customized according to individual circumstances and cannot be generalized. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Zhang Yong # Sharing: The chaos in the domestic insurance industry, where banks lure customers into buying insurance with high commissions, is even linked to the performance evaluations of customer managers. Many customers do not understand investments and choose low-yield or even risky insurance products to preserve their capital. He also shared a case of a friend who was defrauded of over 1.7 million in a romance scam, illustrating the complexity of the domestic financial environment. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s comment: The US financial system strictly separates life insurance from other financial businesses, and there is no such thing as banks selling insurance. The financial supervision in China and Taiwan is problematic. Banks should focus on deposit and loan business and should not be involved in insurance and investment. This chaos will ultimately harm the interests of emerging countries. Question: Does Teacher James share content each week based on reflections on the same theme, or does he summarize viewpoints from reading many books? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: In addition to reading a lot of books, more importantly, independent thinking and critical thinking are involved. The formation of monetary theory stems from thinking about the nature of capitalism, and the content of the handouts mostly comes from students\u0026rsquo; questions and his own reflections. This information is endless. To be an excellent sharer, one needs to have basic knowledge, thinking ability, and originality. Xiao Cai # Sharing 1: Took over the family food business ten years ago when the company\u0026rsquo;s assets and liabilities were zero. After ten years of operation, the company turned a profit, and its current value (including real estate) is about 300 million NTD. Over the past decade, he distributed about 200 million NTD of revenue to his family, retaining 100 million NTD for loan purposes. Currently, he has invested 80 million in 00662 (a 2x leveraged Nasdaq 100 index ETF) and 20 million in 00631L (Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s 50 Positive 2 ETF). Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s comment: None Question 1: The bank will allocate a loan of 60 million NTD on January 1st. Should this fund be used to buy 00662 all at once, or should he wait for a 20% market drop before buying? Also, if the market crashes and 00662 and 00631L go to zero, how will he deal with it? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: If the market goes to zero, the company can still make loan payments. The worst-case scenario is that the land is auctioned off, and he can still get tens of millions. Since the worst has been considered, how to buy the 60 million is not important. If it were me, I would buy it all on Monday. If you choose to wait for a 20% drop before buying, you can follow your plan and inform everyone when you buy. Question 2: How to maintain good health? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Regular comprehensive physical examinations are necessary. I have been doing annual check-ups since my thirties. Wellness, like asset allocation, needs to be personalized. The advice I can give everyone now is to eat well, sleep well, and don\u0026rsquo;t worry. What to eat specifically, what exercises to do, etc., need to be decided according to personal circumstances and cannot be given a unified recommendation. Question 3: What are your views on Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s politics and how to support political parties? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Regarding politics and religious beliefs, everyone has different positions and viewpoints. Discussing these issues in the classroom is meaningless and fruitless. It is recommended that students do not discuss these topics in the classroom and keep their opinions to themselves. Question 4: How to preserve assets in response to potential cross-strait issues? He currently has about 200 million NTD in assets in Taiwan and a house worth 8 million in Vietnam. How should he allocate his assets? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: If you can\u0026rsquo;t sleep due to worries about cross-strait issues, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to immigrate as soon as possible. If you choose to stay in Taiwan, you need to make some decisions, such as whether to close the company. If the 40 employees are causing you distress, consider closing the company and compensating them. Life decisions should be decisive, not prolonged. Be responsible for your own happiness. Additional question: How to get rid of the shackles of the family business? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: You have managed the company very well. The choice is your life. Do whatever makes you happy. If the family business makes you unhappy, shut it down and give the employees a good severance package. Consider your own life, not your father\u0026rsquo;s. If your father\u0026rsquo;s business is no longer your concern, and it\u0026rsquo;s not bringing you happiness, then let it go. Repeated emphasis: Believes that apart from investment and financial management, health is the most important asset in life, and cited the example of \u0026ldquo;Yu (Yuan) Lingqi\u0026rdquo; to emphasize the importance of regular health check-ups, hoping the channel will pay more attention to health issues. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Health is very important. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s health condition is different, and it is impossible to provide a unified recommendation. Everyone needs to pay attention to and manage their health according to their own situation. Lare # Question: Based in Canada, unable to leverage stocks. If income decreases in a certain year, and the tax rate drops from 32% to 24%, is it worth selling some stocks to increase income to the 32% tax bracket to improve the future cost basis? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: It is not recommended to sell stocks because selling incurs taxes. Canada\u0026rsquo;s tax system is very unfavorable for stock investments. When immigrating, consider future generations and choose countries with development prospects. In Canada, you can consider using an IB account for loans, but this will face inheritance tax issues, possibly up to 40%. Therefore, when planning estates, minimize assets in IB accounts. In the long run, trusts can be used to avoid taxes. It is currently not recommended to sell stocks for short-term tax benefits. Consider selling after retirement when income is lower. Additional explanation: IB accounts have a low financing ratio for Canadian stocks, only up to 50%. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s addition: You can borrow 40% first, and add more if needed. But ultimately, there will still be inheritance tax issues. Terry # Question 1: How to transfer taxable accounts or retirement accounts to tax-free accounts, such as Roth IRA? What are the specific steps? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: If it\u0026rsquo;s within the same brokerage, such as Charles Schwab, you can fill out a form online directly. If it\u0026rsquo;s at different brokerages, you need to contact the brokerage to obtain and fill out a form. For specific steps, you can refer to the previously released video \u0026ldquo;Investment and Financial Management Tips 26: How to Transfer from a Traditional Taxable Account to a Roth IRA Online at 722.\u0026rdquo; Question 2: What is your view on Crypto, and will QQQ include Crypto companies in the future? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: I don\u0026rsquo;t know much about Crypto and am not sure if it will exist forever, so I won\u0026rsquo;t answer. IM # Sharing: Through learning, I realized that my investment was too risky, and emergency funds should not all be invested in QQQ. Now I have withdrawn 36 months of emergency funds back to the Money Market Fund. When starting with small funds, one should focus on their main job and increase income sources. After investing in index funds, my mindset changed, and I began to focus on the importance of timing. Therefore, I started to focus on diet, fitness, and learning from the experiences of long-lived people around me. In addition, I learned from investing to avoid risks, such as giving up dangerous activities like diving. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s comment: It is wise to learn from the experiences of others. Being overly aggressive is human nature, but it is important to realize and correct it in time. It is wrong to increase positions when the market is rising and to be fearful when it is falling. It should be the other way around. Emergency funds should not be added to. Question: How to judge whether you are being too adventurous? For example, increasing the leverage ratio of asset allocation from 1.0 to 1.8 when stocks are rising. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: This is also a necessary evil. Now that you realize it\u0026rsquo;s not right, you can start to retreat, or when it rises, you buy in, and when it falls, you get scared. Oh, what to do? Then start to retreat. Once you have learned, don\u0026rsquo;t do it again. So, as Buffett said, when others are greedy, you should be fearful, and when others are fearful, you should be greedy. That\u0026rsquo;s the right pace. So, when you want to increase your position in the future, it should be when others are fearful. That\u0026rsquo;s how I do it. This emergency fund should not be increased. Regardless of whether the market is rising or falling, you should not add to this cervical spine disease. How could you add to it? This is not allowed. Then, if you use our asset allocation, when the market falls, you automatically buy in for one year, and when the market rises, you automatically withdraw from the leveraged fund. This is passive, and this has already achieved the practice of being greedy when others are fearful and being fearful when others are greedy. Patty # Question: The relationship between the asset-backed ratio and cash reserves. If asset-backed financing is carried out, how to ensure that the cash on hand is greater than the pledged amount? For example, with assets of 1 million, allocated according to the 721 ratio, 200,000 is pledged, but 100,000 in cash cannot be moved. Is it necessary to balance for one or two years to accumulate 200,000 in cash before making a pledge? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: You cannot borrow 200,000 all at once; you can only borrow 2% per year. When conducting asset-backed financing, the asset allocation should be 433, not 721. Borrow 2% each year and conduct \u0026ldquo;smart rebalancing.\u0026rdquo; Even if the market falls, you will not be forced to liquidate. The cash ratio may be lower than the loan ratio in extreme cases (such as a continuous 10-year decline), but since the total asset value is still greater than the debt, there will be no problem. Mike # Sharing: A friend\u0026rsquo;s experience. The friend took over his father\u0026rsquo;s family business and eventually had health problems due to overwork. He later sold the company for over 600 million and invested the funds in QQQ. He is now very happy. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s comment: None Question 1: Regarding 401k and RMD. Previously, company stock was placed in a 401k, and now it has a high value, facing the RMD issue. After Trump takes office, is it possible to abolish RMD and change it to a 15% capital gains tax? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: This possibility is extremely slim. The government is unlikely to give up the tax revenue brought by RMD. Question 2: Regarding the Debt to Equity Ratio of companies. It is found that there are large differences in the debt-to-equity ratios of Buffett and many technology companies. Is this related to the nature of the industry? For example, the debt-to-equity ratio of software companies is usually low, while that of hardware companies like Apple is high. So, for individuals, is it a healthy level to control the debt-to-equity ratio at 0.2? Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: The higher the debt-to-equity ratio, the higher the ROE usually is, but this needs to be based on healthy debt. Healthy debt refers to debt that can be repaid through its own operating activities, such as credit, stock-backed loans (under safe circumstances), and mortgages (that can be repaid). Apple\u0026rsquo;s debt-to-equity ratio is high because it borrows a lot of money to pay dividends and places assets overseas. In addition, it has a large amount of accounts payable. Therefore, it cannot be simply considered that a high debt-to-equity ratio is bad. It is necessary to analyze the nature and safety of the debt specifically. Question 3: What are your thoughts on the Jetson Orin product launched by Nvidia? This product is mainly for the personal AI market, is cheap, can use ChatGPT to generate code, and runs locally, thereby creating your own AI database. Teacher James\u0026rsquo;s reply: I don\u0026rsquo;t know much about this product. Our AI is mainly trained using ChatGPT as a personal assistant. Currently, I don\u0026rsquo;t use other devices for personal AI. IV.

Summary # The core argument of this book is: Regular investing is the optimal investment strategy for ordinary people. Li Xiaolai uses a unique perspective and accessible language to systematically explain the advantages, principles, and implementation of regular investing. He argues that compared to other investment methods, regular investing is more suitable for ordinary people due to its simplicity, lower risk, and ability to overcome human weaknesses. It helps investors maintain rationality amidst market fluctuations, ultimately achieving steady wealth growth. Beyond investment techniques, the book also touches upon personal growth, mindset, and life choices, aiming to help readers establish a sound investment philosophy and wealth outlook, ultimately achieving financial freedom and happiness.\nII. Chapter Summaries # 1. Almost Everyone is Qualified and Capable of Regular Investing # Most people possess the ability to invest regularly, but they often choose the wrong target (real estate). The author uses the common phenomenon of \u0026ldquo;mortgage slaves\u0026rdquo; to illustrate that most people are unconsciously engaged in a form of regular investing – real estate. Their monthly mortgage payments essentially constitute a form of regular investment. However, due to high interest rates and low liquidity, real estate is not the optimal choice. He contrasts this with the example of investing regularly in Kweichow Moutai stock for 18 years, resulting in a 180-fold increase, highlighting the significant advantages of stock investing in terms of long-term returns and liquidity. This emphasizes the crucial importance of selecting the right investment target. Due to mortgage burdens, many become \u0026ldquo;mortgage millionaires,\u0026rdquo; possessing seemingly large assets but lacking cash flow and a high quality of life. Advantages of regular investment in stocks/index funds: low barrier to entry, high liquidity, potential for high returns. Compared to other investment methods like investing in early-stage startups or art, stocks and index funds have a low barrier to entry, making them accessible to everyone. Moreover, they offer high liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell at any time, facilitating adjustments to their investment strategies as needed. More importantly, over the long term, the stock market tends to rise with economic development, giving regular investment in stocks/index funds the potential for high returns. The author believes the stock market offers ordinary people an opportunity to share in the growth dividends of excellent companies, an advantage difficult to obtain through other investment avenues. The importance of participating in a regular investing community. The author points out that regular investing is not just an investment strategy but also a social activity. Due to widespread misunderstandings and biases about stock investing (such as \u0026ldquo;investment is risky\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;only the rich invest\u0026rdquo;), investing regularly alone can be easily influenced by external factors, making it difficult to persist. Participating in a regular investing community can help investors overcome these negative influences, gain support and encouragement from peers, establish a correct investment philosophy, and learn more investment knowledge and experience. Within such communities, members can exchange experiences, share insights, and create a positive feedback loop. 2. The Stock Market is the Ninth Wonder of the World # The stock market gives ordinary people the chance to be \u0026ldquo;bosses\u0026rdquo; and share in the growth dividends of excellent companies. The author believes the stock market provides a unique opportunity for ordinary people to invest in well-managed, high-quality companies and share in their profits, even if they have no understanding of business operations. This is an advantage difficult to gain even by working at a company, including publicly listed ones. Through investing, ordinary people can indirectly \u0026ldquo;own\u0026rdquo; multiple excellent companies, achieving wealth appreciation. A simple method for stock selection: choose the most favored stocks or index funds in the market. The author suggests that choosing stocks doesn\u0026rsquo;t require complex analysis and research. One can directly choose the most popular stocks or index funds in the market, such as Kweichow Moutai, Apple, or Tencent. These represent the collective wisdom of the smartest people in the market, and choosing them is akin to leveraging their free advice. He further notes that the advice from the smartest people in the market is often free, like Warren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s portfolio information and popular stock choices. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about making the wrong choice; market consensus is more important than individual judgment. Even if the most favored stock in the market eventually fails, there\u0026rsquo;s no need for excessive self-blame, as it represented the best available advice at the time. Individual judgment rarely surpasses market consensus. In the long run, market forces will correct errors, so the key is to hold long-term and trust the power of the market. The author believes that rather than spending significant time and energy researching individual stocks, it\u0026rsquo;s better to trust the collective wisdom of the market and choose widely recognized, excellent companies. 3. Are There Any Investment Targets that Only Go Up? # Investing in a single stock is high-risk, with unlimited opportunity cost, and requires diversification. Even the best-performing single company can face significant risks due to industry decline, black swan events, or other unpredictable factors. Concentrating funds in a single stock represents high risk, and losses can be difficult to recover if problems arise. The author cites Kodak and Nokia as examples, illustrating how even once-great companies can decline. Hence, diversification is essential to mitigate risk. In the long run, the only investment that only goes up is human economic development, which can be accessed through index funds. The author argues that the human economy generally trends upwards over the long term, and index funds track the overall market performance. By investing in index funds, one can effectively diversify risk and share in the dividends of long-term economic growth. The 40-year performance chart of the S\u0026amp;P 500 is compelling evidence. Investing in index funds is like betting on the national, or even global, economy, and offers better odds in the long run. Long-term investment is necessary to dilute risk and ultimately achieve stable returns. Short-term market fluctuations are difficult to predict and are full of noise and randomness. Only long-term investment can effectively smooth these fluctuations and ultimately generate stable returns. The author emphasizes that there are no investment targets that only go up, only the long-term general upward trend of the human economy. 4. The Only Correct Way for Ordinary People to Invest # Regular investing is the most reliable investment method for ordinary people. The author uses the example of Longmen Fund, comparing lump-sum investing with regular investing. The results show that regular investing achieved a significantly higher return: 74.01% vs. 10.81%. Regular investing can effectively smooth market fluctuations and reduce investment risk. Regular investing helps investors overcome fear and greed, maintaining rationality during market fluctuations. Through regular, fixed-amount investments, investors can buy more shares at lower prices during market downturns, averaging down their cost. During market upturns, it prevents investing too much at once, avoiding being trapped at high prices. The discipline of regular investing can help investors overcome the human weakness of chasing rising markets and selling during falls. Regular investing is a long-term strategy that requires patience and discipline. Returns from regular investing take time to accumulate. Investors need to be patient and maintain discipline, not easily interrupting or changing their investment plan, to achieve significant returns. 5. Why So Few People Use Regular Investing # \u0026ldquo;Fear of simplicity\u0026rdquo; hinders people from accepting regular investing. People tend to believe in complex and sophisticated methods, underestimating the power of simplicity. This is similar to how it took a long time for people to think of adding wheels to luggage, learning English through consistent reading aloud, improving writing through effective reading, and maintaining health through regular exercise. Regular investing\u0026rsquo;s simplicity makes it easier to adhere to, avoiding the risks of frequent trading. Compared to complex trading strategies, regular investing is simple and easy to follow, avoiding transaction costs and the risk of misjudgment associated with frequent trading. The author believes that this simplicity is precisely the greatest advantage of regular investing. People lack understanding and patience for long-term investing. Most people crave quick riches and struggle to endure the \u0026ldquo;loneliness\u0026rdquo; of long-term investing. They are easily influenced by short-term market fluctuations and often give up, as seen in the Longmen Fund example, where lump-sum investors were more prone to panic selling during market declines. 6. The Profound Mechanisms Behind the Magic of Regular Investing # Proactive personality is important, but recognize the boundaries of proactivity. Be proactive within your circle of influence, but also recognize your limitations. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to control what you cannot, such as your children\u0026rsquo;s future or the operations of companies you\u0026rsquo;ve invested in. Factors that determine destiny often lie outside our control, such as trends. Personal effort is important, but it\u0026rsquo;s also essential to align with the trends of the times. Like snooker player Ronnie O\u0026rsquo;Sullivan, even with immense effort, competitors find it challenging to defeat him at his peak. Active passivity is the best strategy for navigating trends. Actively choose the right trend, then passively wait for the trend to unfold. In investing, this means actively choosing promising assets or indices for the long term, then passively adhering to a regular investment schedule. Regular investing is the best practice of \u0026ldquo;active passivity.\u0026rdquo; Choosing worthy long-term investments is active; regularly buying a fixed amount and holding long-term is passive. The power of passivity is fully demonstrated in long-term investing. The long-term performance of passive funds often surpasses that of actively managed funds, demonstrating the limitations of \u0026ldquo;active management\u0026rdquo; and the strength of long-term holding. Ordinary people can improve their investment abilities by controlling their own behavior, such as improving their ability to earn outside of the market. Earning power outside of the market is the cornerstone of regular investing and a key factor ordinary people can actively improve. Understanding \u0026ldquo;long-term\u0026rdquo; determines investment outcomes. \u0026ldquo;Long-term\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean forever, but \u0026ldquo;at least two major cycles,\u0026rdquo; which, based on market changes, is approximately seven years. Ordinary people\u0026rsquo;s money has no expiration date, a significant advantage over professional fund managers. Professional fund managers are constrained by fund deadlines and investor pressure, while ordinary people can invest long-term with more composure, fully utilizing the power of time. 7. The Difference Between Stupidity and Ignorance, and Passive Intelligence # Smart people can make ignorant mistakes in unfamiliar fields. Like Archimedes and Zu Chongzhi, geniuses in their respective fields could make mistakes in the unfamiliar territory of the stock market due to a lack of specific knowledge. Regular investing allows ordinary people to be passively intelligent investors from the start. The strategy\u0026rsquo;s simplicity avoids errors associated with complex operations, allowing ordinary people to achieve reasonable returns without becoming investment experts. Regular investing cultivates patience, discipline, and the habit of investing within one\u0026rsquo;s means. Long-term regular investing requires patience and discipline. The investment amount should also be within one\u0026rsquo;s means to avoid impacting daily life. These are all good investment habits. 8. Some People Are Always on the Right Side # People with great goals are more likely to make the right choices in a mirrored world. A sense of purpose allows focus on long-term value instead of being distracted by short-term fluctuations. The author quotes Arnold Schwarzenegger\u0026rsquo;s speech, emphasizing the importance of goals: \u0026ldquo;The only reason I\u0026rsquo;m standing here today is because I had a goal.\u0026rdquo; Imbuing what you do with great meaning can ignite powerful self-motivation. A sense of meaning provides stronger motivation to persist. The author uses his own writing and teaching experience to illustrate the significance of meaning and encourages readers to find meaning in their regular investing, such as \u0026ldquo;for the children\u0026rsquo;s future\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;for early retirement.\u0026rdquo; 9. A Glimpse into the Other Side of the Mirror World # Investors who don\u0026rsquo;t adopt regular investing easily fall into various investment traps, ultimately leading to losses. These include chasing rising markets, frequent trading, blindly following the crowd, and listening to rumors, often resulting in substantial losses during market volatility. Many investors blame their losses on greed, but the real root cause is a lack of understanding of the investment target. The author argues that greed is human nature and not the fundamental reason for investment failures. The true cause lies in a lack of understanding of the investment target, an inability to judge its intrinsic value, leading to blind following or emotionally driven decisions, ultimately resulting in buying high and selling low. Even those who use regular investing need to deeply understand its core principles to avoid becoming half-baked investors. This includes failing to carefully select investment targets, not holding long-term, investing too little, or easily interrupting the investment plan. The author criticizes investors who don\u0026rsquo;t truly grasp the essence of regular investing and merely engage in mechanical operations. 10. Regular Investing is Essential for Ordinary People # The insignificance of effort: Ordinary people have limited free time, making it difficult to achieve significant success solely through hard work. The author uses data and personal experiences to illustrate that even with extraordinary effort, such as working 24 years without holidays or cutting his own hair, the gains are limited. He only managed to gain 1.26 years of effective working time compared to others. The essence of investing is to make money work for you, compensating for limited time and energy. Investing allows money to work 24/7, amplifying returns far beyond what one can earn through personal labor. Warren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s 78-year investing journey serves as a prime example. Regular investing is an effective path for ordinary people to achieve financial freedom. The strategy is simple and easy to execute. Long-term adherence can generate substantial returns, helping ordinary people accumulate wealth and eventually achieve financial freedom. III. Key Quotes # Diligence in practice makes one invincible!\nRegular investing is the only reliable investment method for ordinary people.\nThere are no investment targets that only rise, only those that rise in the long term.\nBe proactive when you should be, and passive when you should be.\nYour money may not be much, but it has no expiration date.\nIV.

Main Topic # This session focuses on year-end investment strategies. James emphasizes the importance of rebalancing and delves into investment philosophy, asset allocation, handling market fluctuations, and other practical investment tips. The core message is: adopt a long-term investment approach, adhere to the \u0026ldquo;buy whenever you have money, never sell\u0026rdquo; strategy, and implement a suitable asset allocation and rebalancing plan based on individual circumstances.\nII. Briefing Content # Year-End Rebalancing and Asset Allocation # Importance of Rebalancing: James stresses the importance of rebalancing at the end or beginning of the year. He recommends passive rebalancing, which means rebalancing when the market is performing well, to avoid panic selling during market downturns. He points out that many investors are reluctant to rebalance during market rallies, hoping to earn more, but end up succumbing to losses during declines and selling at the bottom, resulting in greater losses. Pledging Stocks for Tax Payment: He advises individuals with pledged stocks to borrow money for tax payments instead of selling the stocks to avoid increasing capital gains tax and to better utilize their funds. He emphasizes that under the premise of sound asset allocation and risk management, the borrowed money can be used flexibly. Real Estate Investment: James advises against buying real estate, believing it restricts personal freedom. He uses the example of a friend in the Bay Area selling their property to support this viewpoint, pointing out the high holding costs of real estate, including property taxes, maintenance fees, and insurance, which can put significant financial pressure on individuals. Children\u0026rsquo;s Education and Wealth Perspective: He suggests parents support their children\u0026rsquo;s choices, believing that happiness is more important than wealth. Children shouldn\u0026rsquo;t live for the sake of glorifying their family but should pursue happiness, serve others, and do what they love. 433 Asset Allocation Plan: James recommends the 433 asset allocation plan (40% QQQ, 30% TQQQ, 30% Cash) for the general public, adjustable based on individual circumstances. For retirees who are not pledging stocks, he suggests an 80/20 allocation (80% index funds, 20% cash). For investors unfamiliar with or averse to leveraged ETFs, he recommends 100% investment in QQQ or 00662. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s Investment Environment Advantage: James highly praises Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s investment environment, believing it possesses cutting-edge financial tools, tax-free policies, and low interest rates, making it an ideal place for investment. He encourages Taiwanese investors to leverage this advantage. Mid-Life Investment Strategy: He advises middle-aged individuals, even with modest incomes, to persist in monthly investments, accumulating wealth gradually for retirement. He illustrates the returns of monthly investments of 5,000 and 10,000 at retirement with specific examples. Advantages of Nasdaq 100 Index Funds: James explains the rationale for investing in QQQ, stating that its constituent companies have strong profitability, focus on technology and innovation, and align with long-term human development trends. He also points out that the constituent companies of the Nasdaq 100 index have stronger profitability compared to the S\u0026amp;P 500. Investment Philosophy: He advocates for the \u0026ldquo;buy whenever you have money, never sell\u0026rdquo; strategy, ignoring short-term fluctuations and believing in the long-term upward trajectory of the market. He emphasizes that the purpose of investment is wealth appreciation, not short-term gains, and criticizes the drawbacks of short-term trading. The Difference Between the Rich and the Poor: James points out that the rich possess assets and credit, which they can use to \u0026ldquo;print money\u0026rdquo; through leverage for rapid wealth growth. The poor, lacking investment knowledge, keep their money in banks, missing out on wealth growth opportunities. He uses the example of Warren Buffett issuing bonds to illustrate how the rich utilize credit for investment. Three Contributions of Investors: First, allocating capital to the most efficient companies, promoting technological advancement; second, helping the government invest idle foreign exchange reserves; third, helping the poor activate their funds, maximizing their social value. Other Investment Advice and Opinions # Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly trust the investment advice of financial advisors and banks, as they have profit motives and may recommend products beneficial to themselves, not necessarily to investors. Don\u0026rsquo;t believe in investment recommendations from so-called \u0026ldquo;group leaders\u0026rdquo; or random individuals. Think independently, make your own decisions, and be responsible for your investments. Focus on investing in broad-market passive funds in the US, such as the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQQ) and the S\u0026amp;P 500 Index Fund (SPY). He provides codes for investing in Nasdaq 100 index funds globally. Avoid investing in unfamiliar assets like Bitcoin. Focus on core investment strategies to avoid distractions. Don\u0026rsquo;t overemphasize short-term market fluctuations and various news. Maintain an optimistic mindset and firmly believe in the long-term upward trend of the market. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Zhang Yong # Sharing: Expresses gratitude to James, shares his 15-year experience in the insurance industry, reflects on some existing problems within the industry, such as promoting low-yield financial insurance, and expresses admiration for the simplicity and effectiveness of the CLEC investment philosophy and how it can change his and his family\u0026rsquo;s financial future. He also shares his desire to help friends and family learn the CLEC investment philosophy but acknowledges the challenges in promotion. James\u0026rsquo;s comments: Affirms Zhang Yong\u0026rsquo;s sharing and thanks Dr. Lao Chai for the recommendation. Emphasizes the power of word-of-mouth marketing and encourages Zhang Yong to continue promoting the CLEC investment philosophy. Mike # Sharing: Shares a discussion with friends in Taiwan about QQQ\u0026rsquo;s component stock adjustments and rebalancing mechanism, mentioning the Matthew effect and the idea that the strong get stronger. He also expresses surprise at the relatively small total market capitalization of QQQ. James\u0026rsquo;s comments: Suggests focusing on long-term performance rather than short-term fluctuations and explains that QQQ\u0026rsquo;s smaller market cap is due to the relatively low number of people who understand and invest in it. Question 1: The impact of QQQ component adjustments and rebalancing mechanisms on investments, and whether one should invest in the smaller 90 companies. James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Advises focusing on long-term performance and volatility, not short-term component adjustments. QQQ\u0026rsquo;s adjustment mechanism ensures the inclusion of the best companies, illustrated by the performance of Mega 7 and MAGS. Points out the \u0026ldquo;stronger get stronger\u0026rdquo; phenomenon among large companies and explains QQQ\u0026rsquo;s rebalancing mechanism. Question 2: James\u0026rsquo;s methods, tools, and experience in creating short videos, and the application of AI technology. James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Details the short video production process, including writing scripts, using speech recognition software, text-to-video conversion, and subtitle generation. He shares his experience with AI tools, emphasizing the importance of personal creation and the limitations of AI in emotional expression. Mentions using tools like speech recognition software, PowerDirector, and some Chinese and Taiwanese video production software. Hui # Question 1: FNGS has performed better than QQQ. Can FNGS replace QQQ? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: No, because FNGS has excessive volatility and higher risk, illustrated by the 2000 tech bubble. Emphasizes that asset allocation should consider volatility and maximum drawdown, not just performance. In the long run, QQQ offers better stability. Question 2: XLG has lower volatility than QQQ and decent returns. Is it suitable for allocation? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: No, because XLG\u0026rsquo;s long-term performance is inferior to QQQ. He provides a performance comparison of QQQ and XLG from 2006 to the present, showing QQQ\u0026rsquo;s significantly higher returns. Emphasizes focusing on long-term performance and avoiding investments with poor long-term track records despite low short-term volatility. Investments with less than 30 years of market history are not worth discussing. Ethan # Sharing: Shares his two-year experience learning and promoting the CLEC investment philosophy in China, highlighting the positive impact and challenges. He suggests domestic investors consider opening accounts in Hong Kong to invest in QQQ and shares the advantages of investing in Hong Kong. James\u0026rsquo;s comments: Affirms Ethan\u0026rsquo;s sharing and promotional efforts, agrees with his suggestion of opening accounts in Hong Kong, and adds to the advantages, such as access to leveraged ETFs and money market funds, making the 433 asset allocation plan more comprehensive. Ling # Sharing: Shares her experience and understanding of the CLEC investment philosophy and how she applies it to life, such as educating her children. She shares a childhood story of collecting shells for money and her desire for investment. James\u0026rsquo;s comments: Acknowledges Ling\u0026rsquo;s sharing and praises her proactive approach. Question: How to pledge stocks after retirement? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Explains the process of pledging stocks after retirement and emphasizes the importance of asset allocation. Suggests the 433 asset allocation plan, adjusted according to the value of the pledged stocks. Explains how to calculate borrowing limits based on the value of pledged stocks and how to add collateral. Martin # Sharing: Shares his investment experience and observations in Europe and expresses envy for the US investment environment. Mentions issues such as strict regulations and heavy tax burdens in Europe. James\u0026rsquo;s comments: Agrees with Martin\u0026rsquo;s viewpoint, analyzes the disadvantages of the European investment environment, such as high taxes and restrictions on the tech industry, and explains his focus on the US market. Points out that European socialist ideology and wealth expropriation are detrimental to capital accumulation and economic development. Ying # Sharing: Reflects on some mistakes in his investment journey, such as missing a year of market gains for a 5% fixed deposit interest rate, and shares his experience and insights on all-in investing in QQQ and TQQQ, and how he persuaded his wife to start investing. James\u0026rsquo;s comments: Affirms Ying\u0026rsquo;s sharing and reiterates the \u0026ldquo;buy whenever you have money, never sell\u0026rdquo; strategy and the all-in investment philosophy. Points out the importance of overcoming human weaknesses for investment success. Pamela # Sharing: Shares the story of her neighbor being scammed by an accountant, reminding everyone to be cautious of investment risks and not to trust others blindly, even friends or professionals. James\u0026rsquo;s comments: Agrees with Pamela\u0026rsquo;s point, emphasizes the importance of improving one\u0026rsquo;s financial literacy, and advises against over-reliance on financial advisors and accountants. Points out that an accountant\u0026rsquo;s responsibility is tax filing, not financial planning, so investors should not solely rely on their investment advice. Nick # Sharing: Shares his investment experience in Canada, recommends HQU, the Canadian equivalent of QQQ, and discusses using IBKR\u0026rsquo;s margin account. Highlights the challenges of investing in Canada and how to utilize IBKR for leverage. James\u0026rsquo;s comments: Thanks Macro for sharing and suggests that IBKR\u0026rsquo;s margin account might be an option for investors in countries without stock pledging. Recommends that investors from other countries try and provide feedback on their experience with IBKR\u0026rsquo;s margin account. Julie # Question 1: Will pledging stocks affect mortgage refinancing? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: No, stock pledging does not appear on credit reports and will not affect mortgage refinancing rates. He advises Julie to pledge her stocks as soon as possible and not wait for interest rates to decline, as future interest rate movements are unpredictable. Question 2: How to use TQQQ for investment and how to balance returns and risks? How to invest the money set aside for property taxes? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Suggests the 433 asset allocation plan, adjustable based on individual circumstances. Emphasizes the importance of Beta management and recommends holding leveraged ETFs in retirement accounts. He advises against investing property tax money in TQQQ, recommending instead to keep it in cash or money market funds for unexpected needs. Other Q\u0026amp;A # James answers audience questions on topics such as 20-year investment returns, Warren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s cash holdings, account selection for funds, short video production, the impact of FNG\u0026rsquo;s bankruptcy on QQQ, simulating investments in the top ten stocks, stock pledging in Taiwan, 50/25/25 asset allocation, money market fund selection, leveraged ETF investment ratios, investment time horizons, and investment options in Canada.

Main Topic # This session revolves around investment and life wisdom. The core idea is to maintain a long-term perspective on investments, avoid being influenced by short-term market fluctuations, and continuously learn from life experiences to form one\u0026rsquo;s own investment philosophy and life wisdom. Just like life, investment also requires continuous learning and reflection.\nII. Presentation Content # Utilizing Revolving Line of Credit Home Loans # People nearing retirement can consider using a revolving line of credit home loan (HELOC), treating the credit line as a part of their cash reserves for living expenses without touching the principal investment, thereby increasing overall asset returns. For example, if someone has $40 million in retirement funds and obtains a $10 million HELOC, the total assets become $50 million, and the annual disposable funds increase from $800,000 to $1 million. The HELOC credit line can supplement the 20% cash portion of asset allocation. Note: It\u0026rsquo;s easier to obtain a HELOC before retirement; it becomes more difficult afterward. The loan term typically doesn\u0026rsquo;t exceed age 90. It\u0026rsquo;s not recommended to take out a loan after retirement to repay the HELOC. A listener shared a strategy of using a HELOC for living expenses, which James considers a good option. Investment Philosophy and Market Analysis # The market, like life, requires a long-term perspective to see the big picture. Avoid being misled by short-term fluctuations. In the age of AI, human development will accelerate, and the market will continue to rise. The next two to three decades will be a period of prosperity. QQQ might reach $500,000. Focus on long-term trends in investing. Don\u0026rsquo;t be swayed by short-term market analysts or news. Focus on long-term growth, not short-term gains. If you can\u0026rsquo;t withstand a 50% loss, it\u0026rsquo;s not recommended to enter the market. Invest in Nasdaq 100 index funds (QQQ), unless retirement funds are insufficient. Short-term declines are inevitable. Be mentally prepared and maintain sufficient cash reserves. Reiterates the long-term investment strategy of \u0026ldquo;buy when you have money, never sell,\u0026rdquo; and recommends single lump-sum market price purchases. Extracting Life Wisdom # Strive for daily progress, reflect and summarize regularly (daily, monthly, yearly). Extract life philosophy from experiences and store them in your personal \u0026ldquo;database\u0026rdquo; to continuously accumulate wisdom. Reflect on everything, from trivial matters (like growing tomatoes) to major social events, to form a comprehensive outlook on life and investment philosophy. Learn from past experiences. Reflect on what you would do differently if given a second chance to improve yourself. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Michael # Question 1: How to use the smart rebalancing strategy before retirement? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: As long as you hold leveraged funds, you can use the smart rebalancing strategy. Question 2: How to calculate the Beta value of a portfolio holding TQQQ, QQQ, and cash? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Calculate the weighted average based on the proportion of each asset and its corresponding Beta value (cash is 0, QQQ is 1, TQQQ is 3). He reshared the calculation formula with the audience. Louis Lu # Sharing: Expressed admiration for James\u0026rsquo;s insights from a month prior regarding the possibility of Bitcoin becoming a reserve currency for the US dollar, noting that James\u0026rsquo;s response aligned with Federal Reserve Chairman Powell\u0026rsquo;s views. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Expressed gratitude for the acknowledgment and mentioned that it\u0026rsquo;s a fundamental concept in finance and monetary policy, covered in previous lessons. Shu Fen # Sharing: Shared her experience of investing most of her retirement funds in savings insurance a few years ago, resulting in much lower returns than expected. This year, she redeemed a portion of the funds and invested in QQQ, achieving better returns (13.68% in three months). However, with the current market reaching new highs, she\u0026rsquo;s hesitant to invest further, finding it difficult to overcome the psychological barrier of \u0026ldquo;buying with eyes closed.\u0026rdquo; James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Courage comes from the subconscious and requires training. Believe that the market will continue to rise and practice self-hypnosis to reinforce the \u0026ldquo;buy when you have money\u0026rdquo; concept. Used the example of QQQ potentially reaching $500,000 to illustrate that the current price is still very cheap. Sen Lin # Question: What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between 00662 and QQQ? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Suggested referring to the relevant link, as this question has been answered multiple times to avoid redundant explanations. Yi Wan # Sharing: Agreed with James\u0026rsquo;s investment method but hesitated to share it with older or same-age individuals. Felt more comfortable sharing with younger people, such as encouraging students to start saving $50-$100 per month. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Sharing depends on缘分 (affinity/serendipity). Sometimes our remedy is another\u0026rsquo;s poison. Sharing can also have negative consequences. Zai # Sharing: Responded to Shu Fen\u0026rsquo;s question about lump-sum buying, suggesting buying in batches or on specific dates, such as birthdays, to overcome psychological barriers. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Investing requires reaching a state of belief. Continuous self-hypnosis is needed. \u0026ldquo;Buy immediately at market price when you have money\u0026rdquo; is the only truth, no further analysis needed. Ai Na # Sharing: After following James\u0026rsquo;s advice, she redeemed funds from savings insurance and invested in QQQ and QLD. However, due to insufficient trading frequency, she couldn\u0026rsquo;t purchase QQQ 2D. Her current living expenses are primarily covered by alimony, and the cost of living in Taiwan is relatively low. Question 1: Does she need to buy and sell repeatedly to meet the trading frequency requirement? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Yes, she can make small, frequent trades to meet the brokerage\u0026rsquo;s requirements. Question 2: Can she buy fractional shares in Taiwan? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Yes, but it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to buy whole shares first and use the remaining funds for fractional shares. Question 3: How to calculate retirement fund needs? Can she receive social security? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Calculate retirement fund needs based on annual expenses. Alimony can be considered income, but it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to claim social security (even if her ex-husband objects) and adjust the asset allocation ratio accordingly, as alimony is not a permanent income source. She needs to be prepared. Also recommended switching from SWVXX to BOXX. Chen Feng # Sharing: Shared his personal investment journey, starting from entering the stock market in 2021, experiencing the \u0026ldquo;bruised and battered\u0026rdquo; phase of short-term trading, to shifting to long-term investing after encountering James\u0026rsquo;s channel. He also established a study group of nearly 300 people, experiencing the benefits of \u0026ldquo;teaching and learning from each other.\u0026rdquo; He shared how he introduced the investment philosophy to his sister with 30 years of stock market experience, emphasizing the importance of a gradual approach. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Affirmed PC\u0026rsquo;s sharing, adding the principles of \u0026ldquo;Buddha saves those who are destined\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Sentient beings save the Buddha.\u0026rdquo; When sharing investment concepts with family, start with small amounts of capital, like planting seeds and nurturing them gradually. Nai Xi # Sharing: Thanked James and her friend Yu Sheng for their help. Shared experiences of learning and sharing investment concepts with friends and expressed gratitude for the study group. James\u0026rsquo;s Comment: Shared his early investment experience in 1990, being introduced to investing by his friend Frank, who patiently explained investment knowledge to him weekly, eventually igniting his passion for investing. Emphasized the importance of mentors. IM # Sharing: Felt that James is cultivating logical thinking in students and shared experiences of communicating investment concepts with others. Question 1: How did James achieve such a comprehensive understanding? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Continuously review and summarize life experiences, extracting the essence, like refining an elixir. Question 2: How to communicate with people who believe \u0026ldquo;the first $1 million is difficult\u0026rdquo; and are hesitant to go all in? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Guide them to think about how to achieve the first $1 million goal and the path to wealth. Suggest small investments based on their risk tolerance, like planting seeds, to gradually cultivate investment confidence. Hao Qing # Sharing 1: Discussed the psychological pressure of buying after a stock reaches new highs. Experienced investors feel more pressure due to having reference points, while newcomers are more receptive. Like buying discounted items in a supermarket, having the original price as a reference makes purchasing more appealing. Sharing 2: Shared his views on two newly issued ETFs by Invesco (QBI and QQLV) and compared them to QQQ. QBI selects larger market cap stocks from QQQ, while QQLV selects stocks with lower volatility. Question: What are James\u0026rsquo;s views on these two new ETFs? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Doesn\u0026rsquo;t recommend investing in unfamiliar ETFs, even if they perform well. Stick to investments within your circle of competence. Used the analogy of marriage, advising to choose a partner you understand. Re-emphasized the importance of focusing on asset allocation and Beta adjustments rather than selecting new investment targets. IV. Key Takeaways # Buy immediately at market price when you have money. \u0026ndash; James\nThis is James\u0026rsquo;s repeatedly emphasized investment philosophy, aiming to overcome investors\u0026rsquo; psychological barriers and seize market opportunities.\nLife shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be lived in vain. Continuously reflect, summarize, and extract wisdom from experiences. \u0026ndash; James\nThis is not just investment wisdom, but life wisdom.\nTeaching and learning promote each other. Buddha saves sentient beings, and sentient beings save the Buddha. \u0026ndash; James, Chen Feng\nBoth teachers and students can grow through the process of teaching and sharing.\nThe seed itself is not the problem, it\u0026rsquo;s the soil. \u0026ndash; James\nAn analogy for the dissemination of investment philosophy. Even good ideas require the right environment to take root.\nV. Summary # This session covered investment philosophy, financial management skills, and life wisdom. James reiterated the importance of long-term and value investing and encouraged everyone to overcome the psychological pressure of market fluctuations, firmly implementing the \u0026ldquo;buy when you have money, never sell\u0026rdquo; strategy. He also reminded everyone to continuously learn and extract wisdom from life experiences to ultimately achieve financial freedom and fulfill life\u0026rsquo;s value. He also encouraged listeners to find their own mentors, learn from each other, and grow together, just like his early experiences.\nDisclaimer: This article is for personal learning notes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Topic # The market continues to reach new highs. Investing doesn\u0026rsquo;t require constant attention; the key is to stick to a long-term investment strategy, maintain a well-diversified asset allocation, and remain patient. The real risk isn\u0026rsquo;t short-term volatility, but the inability to accumulate sufficient wealth over the long term, and not knowing how to utilize accumulated wealth effectively. Furthermore, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to be wary of various financial traps and maintain rational investment practices.\nII. Briefing Content # Market Trends and Investment Strategies # The market is at a new high. Don\u0026rsquo;t waste time over-analyzing; stick to long-term investing, buy and hold. The market generally trends upwards; instead of predicting pullbacks, enter the market early. Investing doesn\u0026rsquo;t require excessive time. After placing your order, step away and let time work its magic through compounding. Be wary of scams. Don\u0026rsquo;t trust any investment advice that guarantees stable returns or daily gains. Be extremely cautious of \u0026ldquo;guaranteed profit\u0026rdquo; schemes. Ignore the advice of financial advisors and insurance agents. They rarely have the investor\u0026rsquo;s best interests at heart and are often motivated by their own profits. Many financial products are designed to benefit the seller, not the investor. Investing isn\u0026rsquo;t simple. Even asset allocation within a Nasdaq 100 index fund requires in-depth research and adjustments based on individual circumstances. Investors should always remain optimistic. The market will eventually rise. Patiently await wealth accumulation. Time is an investor\u0026rsquo;s friend. Risk Management and Wealth Goals # The biggest risks are not market fluctuations, but the failure to accumulate sufficient wealth over the long term and not knowing how to utilize accumulated wealth effectively. The ultimate goal of investing is to achieve financial freedom and enjoy life. Avoid the instinctive reaction to short-term losses. Overcome fear and don\u0026rsquo;t panic sell. Market downturns are normal and present buying opportunities. View bear markets as opportunities. Buying low translates to higher future returns. Learn to think contrarily and utilize market fluctuations for mindless rebalancing. The investment objective is to mitigate the risk of financial hardship, not to maximize returns. A sound investment strategy is more crucial than chasing high returns. Choose a simple, low-cost, passive index investment strategy, such as a Nasdaq 100 index fund, and hold a portion in cash to maintain psychological balance and cope with market volatility. Holding safe assets (like certificates of deposit and money market funds) can mitigate short-term risks, stabilize emotions during market fluctuations, and provide a sense of security. The proportion of safe assets held should be adjusted based on age and risk tolerance. Retirees are advised to hold cash equivalent to 5 years of living expenses, while those yet to retire can hold more. Young people should prioritize term life insurance to protect their families and avoid other types of insurance to prevent being misled by insurance companies. Other Advice # Be skeptical of all information, especially regarding money. Learn to think independently and don\u0026rsquo;t blindly trust so-called \u0026ldquo;experts.\u0026rdquo; Don\u0026rsquo;t buy insurance or annuities for investment purposes. The essence of insurance is protection, not investment; annuities have high fees and low returns. Don\u0026rsquo;t disclose your wealth to your children. Encourage them to strive independently and create wealth through their own abilities. Engage in rational discussions, view investments with a mathematical mindset, and analyze investment results with data. Avoid over-investing in real estate. Maintain ample cash flow. Real estate has poor liquidity and is difficult to liquidate. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Ke An # Sharing: 16 years old, living in the Netherlands. Thanked James for his investment methods, which allowed her parents to take her on trips throughout Europe. She also shared that she finds her business management classes easier to understand than her classmates, thanks to James\u0026rsquo;s teachings. James\u0026rsquo;s comments: Praised Ke An\u0026rsquo;s travel experiences and learning attitude, encouraging her to continue learning and explore her career interests. Question: Concerned about starting investing late, wants to open an account and start investing soon. Has saved NT$200,000 and plans to invest in 00662. James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Affirmed the advantage of starting to invest at 16, emphasizing that time is the greatest asset. Advised her to balance learning, life, and investment, and to enjoy her youth. Ji Ya # Question: Has savings equivalent to 8 years of living expenses. Working 40 hours a week only covers expenses. Driving for Uber could increase income but wants more free time. Unsure how to balance work and life and whether early retirement is possible. Is currently 42 years old. James\u0026rsquo;s reply: In 15 years, the 8x annual expenses will grow to 50x due to compounding, enabling retirement. Suggested a BETA of 1.2 to increase investment returns, or driving for Uber a few hours a week to accelerate wealth accumulation and achieve early retirement. Emphasized that pursuing early retirement shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the sole focus and that finding a balance between work and life is important. Health is paramount. Chun Xia # Question 1: Plans to invest a loan of NT$7 million and aims for a return of NT$20-30 million within 10-15 years. Should the investment be lump-sum or staggered? Has additional monthly income of NT$30,000-40,000. James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Based on a 14% annualized return, there will be NT$67 million after 15 years, reaching the NT$20-30 million target within 10 years. Recommended a lump-sum investment to capitalize on market growth. Question 2: Wants to share investment philosophy with family in China. Inquired about account opening procedures and trading software options in China. James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Suggested Chun Xia email him for an introduction to a leader familiar with the Chinese market who can provide specific guidance on account opening and software selection. Peter # Question: How to persuade family members to invest? They\u0026rsquo;ve heard the advice but haven\u0026rsquo;t acted, finding it difficult. James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Acknowledged the \u0026ldquo;familiarity bias\u0026rdquo; that makes it difficult for family members to accept advice. Suggested Peter lead by example, sharing his investment philosophy and success stories. Encourage them to start with a small investment, like $100,000 in QQQ, and offer to cover any losses to build their confidence. He particularly recommended starting with retirement accounts and broad market index funds. Ling # Question: Regarding children\u0026rsquo;s education fund investment plan. Initially planned to invest all children\u0026rsquo;s allowances in 00662 with monthly contributions, but has doubts after hearing James\u0026rsquo;s lessons on children\u0026rsquo;s education. Should the plan be adjusted? James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Advised prioritizing personal wealth accumulation and achieving financial freedom before focusing on children\u0026rsquo;s education funds. Suggested redirecting the monthly contributions to personal investments to accelerate wealth growth. Income like Lunar New Year red envelopes can continue to be invested for the children. Dennis # Sharing 1: An insurance agent passed away due to financial problems, highlighting the importance of risk management, even for insurance professionals. Sharing 2: Family recommended a video by an MIT professor about national debt, who argued that national debt is another form of taxation. James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Explained Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). U.S. national debt represents savings held by the public. The U.S. government\u0026rsquo;s debt is repaid by Americans. The value of the dollar lies in its credit and the goods and services it can buy, not the level of debt. The government can stimulate the economy by issuing national debt without worrying about excessive debt. Issuing national debt and lottery tickets are essentially providing investment channels, not just taxation. Sharing 3: Wants to learn more about MMT. James\u0026rsquo;s reply: Recommended Dennis search for books and materials on \u0026ldquo;Modern Monetary Theory\u0026rdquo; for a deeper understanding of its principles and applications. Hao Xin # Question: Are the P/E ratios of QQQ and SPY overvalued? How to deal with market fluctuations? Concerned that a prolonged stagnant market will cause borrowing interest to exceed cash reserves. James\u0026rsquo;s reply: P/E ratios are unreliable and unpredictable. Recommended passive rebalancing. Cash reserves will increase as the market rises; reinvest during downturns. Suggested simulating the 2000-2009 market scenario to test the robustness of the asset allocation strategy. If the market does stagnate for a long time, adjust lifestyle, reduce expenses, or consider other income sources. In the long run, the market will always go up; maintain confidence. Sharing: Received a suspected scam call where the caller claimed to be from the bank and requested personal information verification. James\u0026rsquo;s comments: Commended Hao Xin\u0026rsquo;s vigilance and reminded everyone to be cautious of calls requesting personal information to avoid being scammed. IV. Key Takeaways # \u0026ldquo;The first investment earns the most; that performance can never be replicated.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; Monica\nMonica\u0026rsquo;s statement highlights the importance of early investment and the difficulty of timing the market. Early investments enjoy higher returns, and over time, even with the same investment strategy, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to replicate those early gains.\n\u0026ldquo;The U.S. government\u0026rsquo;s debt is the public\u0026rsquo;s savings.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; James\nThis perspective challenges the traditional understanding of national debt, emphasizing the unique nature of U.S. Treasury bonds. U.S. national debt represents dollar-denominated assets held by U.S. citizens and global investors, reflecting confidence in the American economy.\n\u0026ldquo;Survival is key, not maximizing returns.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; James\nThis statement pinpoints the core goal of investing, reminding investors not to be tempted by high returns at the expense of risk management. Preserving capital is more important than chasing high returns during market fluctuations.\n\u0026ldquo;Time is an investor\u0026rsquo;s friend.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; James\nOnly long-term investments can fully benefit from the power of compounding. Time is an investor\u0026rsquo;s best ally.\nV. Summary # In this episode, James once again emphasized the importance of long-term investing and risk management, offering personalized advice tailored to each student\u0026rsquo;s circumstances. His clear explanations helped students better understand market trends, investment strategies, and the essence of wealth management. He also shared his understanding of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) and awareness of various financial traps, reminding investors to remain rational and avoid blindly chasing high returns.\nDisclaimer: This article is for personal learning notes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Topic # This lecture focuses on the importance of long-term investing and asset allocation, especially the significance of holding cash (undamaged capital). James reiterates the idea that \u0026ldquo;the only constant in the market is volatility\u0026rdquo; and advises investors to adopt a \u0026ldquo;buy and hold\u0026rdquo; strategy similar to Warren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s, investing long-term in Nasdaq 100 index funds (QQQ or 00662). He uses a rent vs. buy case study to demonstrate the advantages of long-term index fund investing. He also explains in detail the importance of maintaining undamaged capital (cash) in asset allocation to buy the dip during market downturns, thereby achieving long-term stable investment returns.\nII. Summary # Investment Philosophy and Strategy # Long-term Holding: Investing requires a timeframe of 20+ years, ideally forever, without worrying about short-term market fluctuations. James uses Warren Buffett as an example, emphasizing the importance of long-term holding, stating that if one isn\u0026rsquo;t prepared to hold for the long term, they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t even hold for 10 minutes. Invest in the US: The US is the best country for fairness, justice, and open innovation, so invest only in the US. Index Funds: Invest in Nasdaq 100 index funds (QQQ/00662), and recommends new viewers watch introductory videos 00451, 288, and 398. Market Volatility: The only constant in the market is volatility. Ignore market fluctuations and adhere to long-term holding. The 2022 market correction was just a financial event, not a bubble. Bubbles: Bubbles are rare, occurring only twice in the past 25 years. The best way to deal with them is to ignore them and continue holding index funds. Asset Allocation and Cash Management # Undamaged Capital: Having undamaged capital (cash) is crucial. It helps investors stay calm during market panics and buy the dip, just like wealthy individuals. The Significance of Cash: Cash is a stabilizing force that overcomes human flaws in investing (fear and greed), allowing the power of compounding to fully take effect. Cash Ratio: Recommends a cash allocation of at least 20% in the portfolio. Retirement Planning: To withdraw $30,000 annually from an investment account after retirement, $1.5 million in cash is needed. James suggests withdrawing $50,000 annually, requiring $2.5 million in cash, approximately 20% of total assets. Real Estate Investment # Renting is Superior to Buying: In the long run, renting and investing in index funds yields higher returns than buying a house. James shares a PC Excel spreadsheet example demonstrating the advantages of rental investment and encourages viewers to modify the parameters for simulation calculations. Selling Advice: Recommends selling real estate and land, investing the funds in the stock market. There\u0026rsquo;s no real estate that can\u0026rsquo;t be sold, only prices that are too high. Even if sold at a lower price, investment returns may quickly compensate for the difference. Short-term Rental Investment: Short-term rental investments aren\u0026rsquo;t worthwhile unless the annualized return is at least 20%. Retirement Account Management # Traditional IRA to Roth IRA Conversion: Recommends converting funds from traditional IRA accounts to Roth IRA accounts when tax rates are lower (below 24%). Roth IRA Investment: Recommends investing in leveraged ETFs (TQQQ) within Roth IRA accounts, while holding more cash in traditional retirement accounts. Shares a case study suggesting viewers invest Roth IRA funds in TQQQ and hold more cash in traditional retirement accounts to optimize asset allocation. Leveraged ETFs: Retirees should not hold leveraged ETFs. Leveraged ETFs should be held in Roth IRA accounts. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Lora # Question 1: How can I deduct the interest on a pledged loan against the interest earned on cash holdings? James: There\u0026rsquo;s no deduction. If the interest earned on your cash is higher than the loan interest, you\u0026rsquo;re effectively earning more. I recommend buying non-dividend-paying stocks in your personal account, like BOXX, to avoid paying taxes on interest income. Since you don\u0026rsquo;t have a Roth IRA, you can only operate within a brokerage account and will incur some tax costs. Question 2: Which trading software do you recommend? James: Just use your broker\u0026rsquo;s website; no need for additional software. I only use the web version. The \u0026ldquo;positions\u0026rdquo; page on your brokerage website allows you to view the profit and loss of each transaction and manage them in batches. Run # Question 1: Can Roth IRA funds be pledged as collateral? James: Roth IRA funds cannot be directly pledged. However, they can be used as a credit guarantee to lower interest rates on other loans. Question 2: How should I invest after maxing out my Roth IRA contributions? James: Max out your Roth IRA contributions first. Invest the remaining funds in QQQ within a regular brokerage account. Zhan # Question 1: How should I handle my properties in Canada and the US? James: I recommend selling your Canadian property as soon as possible. If your US property is your primary residence, I also suggest selling it and renting instead. It\u0026rsquo;s more cost-effective, as demonstrated in the rent vs. buy case study in the presentation. Question 2: What should I do with my Canadian pension plan? James: I recommend withdrawing the money from your pension plan and investing it in QQQ within a brokerage account. Don\u0026rsquo;t use the 403(b) and TDA accounts provided by your school, as their performance is poor. Stick to your own IRA account. IM # Comment 1: There\u0026rsquo;s a significant wealth gap among young people, and some try to fill it by borrowing money. How can I avoid this trap? James: First, cultivate strong mental fortitude, which can be achieved through reading. Second, don\u0026rsquo;t lend money casually. Third, don\u0026rsquo;t buy things you don\u0026rsquo;t need. Even Warren Buffett, despite his wealth, doesn\u0026rsquo;t buy unnecessary things. Comment 2: I participated in an 11-day meditation retreat and gained insights into the relationship between meditation and investing, particularly the importance of focus. James: Avoid distractions outside the stock market and focus on your investment strategy. Treat distractions like \u0026ldquo;demons and monsters\u0026rdquo;—don\u0026rsquo;t listen, don\u0026rsquo;t watch, don\u0026rsquo;t engage—and you\u0026rsquo;ll maintain composure. Question: Does focusing solely on my own investments lead to detachment from the world? James: There\u0026rsquo;s no need to be overly connected to worldly affairs. Focus on your investments and avoid excessive external information. Important information will eventually reach you. Lin # Question: How should I rebalance my portfolio? James: Since you\u0026rsquo;re still working, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to engage in complex rebalancing. Just rebalance annually, adjusting the proportions of leveraged ETFs (00670L/TQQQ/Q2D) and cash. You can leave your 00662/QQQ holdings untouched. Alternatively, during your monthly investments, maintain an 80% allocation to 00662/QQQ and 20% to 00864B/cash. (He then provides a specific example of adjusting the ratio between 00670L and cash). Lizi # Question: How can I reduce the tax burden from RMDs (Required Minimum Distributions)? James: I recommend withdrawing $600,000 annually from your IRA and transferring it to a Roth IRA over the next seven years. You can invest in leveraged ETFs within the Roth IRA and hold cash in your traditional retirement account to lower your overall return and tax burden. Start converting to a Roth IRA as soon as possible; don\u0026rsquo;t wait until RMDs begin. IV. Key Takeaways # \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re not investing for 20+ years, don\u0026rsquo;t tell me you\u0026rsquo;re investing.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; James\nInvesting requires a long-term perspective. Short-term market fluctuations should not influence investment decisions.\n\u0026ldquo;Undamaged capital is the elixir that keeps us calm.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; James\nHolding cash helps investors remain composed during market volatility and seize opportunities to buy low.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t engage with demons and monsters. If you don\u0026rsquo;t engage, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to train your mind.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; James\nStaying away from market noise and focusing on one\u0026rsquo;s own investment strategy is key to maintaining rational investment decisions.\nV. Conclusion # This lecture reiterates the importance of long-term investing, value investing, and asset allocation, analyzing them with practical examples. James advises investors to hold Nasdaq 100 index funds and maintain a certain percentage of cash to cope with market fluctuations. He answers questions about retirement account management, real estate investment, and personal financial planning, providing specific advice based on individual circumstances. He emphasizes the importance of choosing the right investment strategy and asset allocation according to one\u0026rsquo;s situation.\nDisclaimer: This is a personal learning summary and does not constitute investment advice.

Content Summary # The core concept of this book is that everyone can achieve financial freedom through investment, not just the wealthy or high-income earners. Through thirteen Investment Iron Laws, it emphasizes the importance of correct financial management concepts and long-term investment, encouraging readers to start managing their finances early, invest primarily in high-return investment tools such as stocks and real estate, and hold them for the long term, ultimately achieving financial freedom through the power of compound interest. The book uses numerous real-life examples and simple language to help readers understand and master correct financial management methods, while abandoning common financial management misunderstandings, such as short-term trading and over-reliance on bank deposits.\nII. Chapter Summaries # Correct Concept of Personal Finance # Personal investment can lead to wealth: The author believes that personal investment is not only a means to improve financial status but also an important path to wealth. Even if the monthly investment amount is small, as long as you persevere, you can accumulate considerable wealth by relying on the power of compound interest and ultimately realize the dream of becoming a billionaire. The book illustrates the power of compound interest with the example of investing 1200 Yuan per month with an annual return of 20%, resulting in assets exceeding 100 million Yuan after 40 years. It also cites the financial stories of the Lien Chan family and a postman to prove that even ordinary office workers can accumulate huge wealth with proper financial management. Increasing income and reducing expenditure treats the symptoms, not the root cause: Although diligence and frugality are traditional virtues, it is difficult to achieve financial freedom solely by relying on them in the era of rapid economic development. The author believes that financial management is more important than increasing income and reducing expenditure. The core of financial management lies in \u0026ldquo;making money with money\u0026rdquo; by achieving higher returns through investment, thereby enabling wealth to grow exponentially. The book uses the Lien Chan family\u0026rsquo;s financial management methods as an example to illustrate the importance of investing in stocks and real estate. It points out that the Lien family did not start with huge wealth but accumulated astonishing wealth through long-term investment and financial management. Financial management methods cause the wealth gap: The author believes that the main cause of the wealth gap is not external factors such as family background, personal effort, or luck, but the difference in financial concepts and methods. The rich tend to invest their assets in high-yield investment tools such as stocks and real estate, while the poor tend to deposit money in banks, resulting in a slow rate of wealth appreciation. The book uses the example of two classmates who joined the same company after graduation to illustrate how different financial management methods eventually lead to vastly different wealth outcomes. Investment Iron Law 1: Don\u0026rsquo;t Save Money in the Bank # Saving is equal to wasting resources: The author points out that keeping money in the bank seems safe but is actually a waste of resources. This is because bank deposit interest rates are low, and under the influence of inflation, the real rate of return is close to zero or even negative. This means that money deposited in the bank not only fails to appreciate but also depreciates. The book uses biblical stories and the example of the Nobel Prize Foundation to illustrate that not making good use of wealth, even without loss, is a waste. Deposit interest rates do not have compound interest benefits: Although bank deposits also enjoy compound interest, due to the low interest rate, the effect of compound interest is very limited and difficult to withstand the erosion of inflation. The author compares the final returns of two investment methods after 40 years, using a 5% bank interest rate and a 20% stock/real estate investment return rate as examples, illustrating the importance of the rate of return on investment. The invisible killer of currency value - inflation: Inflation is the \u0026ldquo;invisible killer\u0026rdquo; that causes money to depreciate. The author vividly illustrates the impact of inflation by comparing the price of red bean ice 30 years ago and now. He points out that in an inflationary environment, depositing money in the bank actually means \u0026ldquo;the more you save, the less you have\u0026rdquo;. The way to wealth of Zhang Pingsan, former chairman of Chang Hwa Bank: The author tells the story of Zhang Pingsan, the former chairman of Chang Hwa Bank, who achieved tremendous wealth growth by continuously borrowing money to buy Chang Hwa Bank shares and holding them for a long time. Those who sold their shares and put the money in the bank missed the opportunity to become wealthy. This once again proves the point that \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t save money in the bank\u0026rdquo;. The money deposited in the bank should not exceed living expenses: The author suggests that the amount of money deposited in the bank should be limited to meet two months of living expenses, and the excess should be used for investment to obtain higher returns. He also proposes a \u0026ldquo;two large, one small\u0026rdquo; investment portfolio suggestion: most assets are invested in stocks and real estate, and a small portion of funds is deposited in the bank for emergencies. He explains the liquidity of stocks and real estate to dispel readers\u0026rsquo; concerns about investment liquidity. Investment Iron Law 2: Be Patient to Get Rich Through Financial Management # How Li Ka-shing accumulated wealth: The author uses Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong\u0026rsquo;s richest man, as an example to illustrate the importance of long-term investment. Li Ka-shing accumulated huge wealth through long-term investment in real estate. Getting rich through financial management requires time and patience; it is impossible to achieve overnight success. His success was not solely based on luck or hard work; more importantly, it was due to his long-term vision and perseverance. It takes a long time to see the effect of compound interest in financial management: The manifestation of the compound interest effect takes time, and it is difficult to see significant results in short-term investments. The author uses the example of investing 14,000 Yuan annually with an annual return of 20% to calculate the investment returns after 10, 20, 30, and 40 years, which are 360,000 Yuan, 2.61 million Yuan, 16.55 million Yuan, and 102.81 million Yuan, respectively. This set of data clearly demonstrates the power of compound interest and the importance of waiting patiently. Financial management is more like a marathon than a sprint. As long as you are patient, the money won\u0026rsquo;t run away: Wealth accumulation is a gradual process that requires patience to wait for the compound interest effect to play out. The author uses the land investment experience of Zhang Yaohongying, Chairman of Hongjing Construction, as an example to illustrate that even if the initial investment return is not obvious, as long as you persist in holding it for a long time, you can eventually get a rich return. Getting rich overnight is counterproductive: The author warns readers that getting rich through financial management takes time, and they should not dream of getting rich quickly. Investment opportunities that bring rapid wealth in the short term are often accompanied by extremely high risks, which may eventually lead to losing everything. The author suggests that if you want to get rich quickly, you should choose to start a business instead of resorting to speculation. Investment Iron Law 3: The Sooner You Start Investing, the Better # Procrastination is the main reason for financial failure: The author points out that procrastination is one of the main reasons for financial failure. As age increases, the time available for investment decreases, and the space for the compound interest effect to play out also shrinks. Therefore, financial management should start as early as possible. Do not wait until you are older to realize the importance of financial management, as it is often too late. Start investing from today: The earlier you start investing, the longer the time for compound interest, and the higher the final return. The author calculates the monthly investment amount required under the same target amount and investment rate of return with different starting investment ages as examples. The data shows that the later you start investing, the higher the monthly investment amount required, highlighting the importance of starting financial management early. Jeffrey Koo Jr. is good at making money: The author uses the example of Jeffrey Koo Jr., Vice President of CTBC Financial Holding, to illustrate that even those from wealthy families should learn financial management early. Jeffrey Koo Jr. invested his savings in the stock market during his university days and obtained substantial returns, indicating that young people can also achieve success through financial management. Don\u0026rsquo;t neglect financial management because of lack of money: The author emphasizes that financial management is not exclusive to the rich. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have much money, you should start as early as possible and let the limited funds play the role of compound interest, accumulating little by little to eventually accumulate considerable wealth. Youth is the most appropriate time to take risks: When you are young, you have a lighter family burden and the cost of failure is relatively low, so it is more suitable to take certain investment risks. Moreover, young people have more time to make up for potential losses and learn from their mistakes. Investment Iron Law 4: Make Money with Other People\u0026rsquo;s Money # Good use of debt investment: The author introduces the concept of \u0026ldquo;financial leverage,\u0026rdquo; which refers to using borrowed funds for investment to achieve a small investment with a large return, maximizing profits. He uses the examples of Chen Youhao, President of Eastern Multimedia Group, and Weng Daming of Hualon Group to illustrate how successful entrepreneurs use financial leverage for business expansion and investment. Specific examples are used to calculate the investment return rate under different leverage ratios to help readers understand the principle and role of financial leverage. Two major principles of borrowing: The author proposes two major principles for debt investment: 1. The expected return on investment must be greater than the loan interest rate; 2. In the worst case, cash income must be sufficient to pay the principal and interest of the loan. These two principles emphasize the risks of debt investment and remind readers to rationally evaluate the expected rate of return of the investment target and conduct risk assessment to ensure that even if the investment fails, the principal and interest of the loan can be repaid on time. Banks are not places to save money: The author points out that for people who are good at financial management, banks are not places to save money but sources of borrowing. He explains the operating model of banks: Banks absorb deposits from depositors and then lend these funds to investors. Investors make profits through investment and pay interest to banks. Therefore, people who are good at financial management can use bank funds for investment to magnify returns. Avoid improper debt: The author cautions readers to avoid improper debt. Do not borrow money to participate in high-risk activities such as futures, margin trading, and gambling because the expected return rate of these activities is negative, and long-term participation will inevitably lead to losses. Also, do not over-engage in consumer loans, such as credit card loans and car loans, as high-interest loans will seriously erode personal wealth. Mortgage loans are acceptable, but you should also live within your means and make sure that the monthly repayment pressure is within your affordable range. Investment Iron Law 5: Relieve the Pressure of Investment Risks # Analyze risks and reduce harm: The author points out that risks cannot be completely avoided in the investment process. The purpose of risk management is not to eliminate risk but to analyze risk and reduce the potential harm caused by risk. He emphasizes not to over-rely on forecasting because the accuracy of forecasting is difficult to guarantee, and over-reliance on forecasting may lead investors to lose their risk awareness. Forbes\u0026rsquo; philosophy of distress: The author uses the example of American billionaire Forbes to illustrate that even risk-averse people can take risks through reasonable risk management. Although Forbes doesn\u0026rsquo;t like adventure, in order to experience the beauty of life, he will participate in some high-risk activities, such as hot air ballooning and off-road motorcycles. But he will make full preparations before taking risks and take various measures to reduce risks. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly avoid risks: The author believes that in a changing environment, the biggest risk is not taking risks. In order to obtain higher returns, certain risks must be taken. Blindly avoiding risks may eventually lead to missed opportunities and even failure to achieve financial freedom. Overcome risks - start small: For unfamiliar investments, you should start with small investments, gradually accumulate experience, and gradually improve your risk tolerance. Just like scouts, first test the waters with a small amount to understand the situation, and then gradually increase the investment. There is no high-return, zero-risk investment: The author reminds readers that all high-yield investments are accompanied by high risks and not to believe in the so-called \u0026ldquo;high-yield, risk-free\u0026rdquo; investment scams. If someone recommends such an investment opportunity to you, it is likely that they are trying to deceive you. Investment Iron Law 6: Solve the Crisis of Being Trapped # Diversify your investments and hold them for the long term: The author proposes the investment strategy of \u0026ldquo;diversification and long-term holding\u0026rdquo; and believes that this is the key to avoiding being trapped and obtaining long-term stable returns. Diversified investment can reduce the risk of choosing the wrong investment target; diversifying investment timing can reduce the risk of buying at market highs; long-term holding can reduce the risk brought by short-term market fluctuations and fully enjoy the benefits brought by compound interest. Principle of risk diversification: The principle of diversified investment is to reduce the overall risk of the investment portfolio by increasing the types of investments so that the rise and fall of different assets in the investment portfolio can offset each other. The author points out that diversification is not the more the better and that management costs need to be considered. Too many investment types will increase management difficulty and cost, which is not conducive to improving profits. Diversify investment timing: In order to reduce the risk of buying at market highs, the author suggests spreading the funds over different periods. He proposes two methods: one is \u0026ldquo;invest if you have money,\u0026rdquo; and the other is \u0026ldquo;regularly invest a fixed amount in mutual funds.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Invest if you have money\u0026rdquo; means that once you have idle funds, invest immediately and do not try to predict market timing; \u0026ldquo;regular investment of a fixed amount in mutual funds\u0026rdquo; means investing a fixed amount every month to buy mutual funds. This method can effectively smooth market fluctuations and reduce investment risks. Methods of diversified investment: The author introduces three methods of diversified investment in detail: 1. Diversification of investment tools, such as stocks, real estate, gold, art, etc.; 2. Diversification of investment targets, for example, when investing in stocks, do not just buy one stock, but buy multiple stocks in different industries; 3. Diversification of investment regions, for example, invest some assets in overseas markets to diversify regional risks. Reduce the risk of choosing the wrong selling time - long-term holding: Through research on the Taiwan stock market, the author found that the longer the holding time, the lower the probability of loss. For example, the probability of loss when holding stocks for more than 5 years is only 1%, and it is almost impossible to lose money when holding for more than 10 years. This once again proves the importance of long-term holding. Investment Iron Law 7: Make Good Use of Stock Investment # Liu Qiude\u0026rsquo;s secret to wealth: The author uses the financial story of Liu Qiude, Vice President of Cathay Life Insurance, as an example to illustrate the power of long-term holding of high-quality stocks. Liu Qiude worked at Cathay Life Insurance from his twenties. He held his savings and the Cathay Life Insurance shares he acquired from his colleagues for a long time and eventually became a billionaire. This example also reflects the long-term and stable performance growth of Cathay Life Insurance from the side. Why stocks have high returns: The author explains the source of returns from stock investment: stocks represent ownership of a company, and shareholders can share in the company\u0026rsquo;s profits and asset appreciation. Therefore, the returns from investing in stocks come from corporate earnings and asset appreciation, not from the losses of other investors. He pointed out that the long-term rise in stock prices is mainly due to the improvement of corporate profitability and the growth of asset value. Carefully select the types of stocks to invest in: The author compares the characteristics of listed stocks, over-the-counter stocks, unlisted stocks, and mutual funds and suggests that ordinary investors should give priority to investing in listed stocks or mutual funds. Listed stocks have good liquidity, transparent information disclosure, and relatively strict supervision, so the risks are relatively low. Mutual funds are managed by professionals and can effectively diversify investment risks, making them suitable for investors who do not have much time and energy to research stocks. Stock investment is better than real estate investment: The author compares stock and real estate investment from the aspects of investment threshold, taxation, and trading convenience. He believes that stock investment has a lower threshold, lighter taxes, and is more convenient to trade, making it more suitable for ordinary investors. Can stocks still maintain high returns in the future?: The author analyzes and forecasts the future return rate of the Taiwan stock market. He believes that although Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s economic growth has slowed down, it is still higher than other countries and regions, so the Taiwan stock market still has high investment value in the future, but the return rate may be slightly lower than in the past. Investment Iron Law 8: Make Money When You Buy and Sell # Buy casually, buy at any time, don\u0026rsquo;t sell: The author once again emphasizes the investment strategy of \u0026ldquo;buy casually, buy at any time, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; and points out that this is the highest level of financial management. This strategy seems simple, but it actually contains profound investment wisdom: it emphasizes long-term holding, infrequent trading, and avoiding being affected by short-term market fluctuations, thereby obtaining long-term and stable returns. The author admits that most people find it difficult to do this because they cannot overcome human weaknesses such as greed and fear. What to buy - buy casually: The author points out that as long as diversified investment is achieved, the selection of individual stocks is not important. He uses the experiment of \u0026ldquo;monkeys throwing darts to select stocks\u0026rdquo; and his own experience of selecting stocks with his children as examples to illustrate the effectiveness of \u0026ldquo;buying casually\u0026rdquo;. When to buy - buy at any time: The author suggests that investors \u0026ldquo;buy if they have money\u0026rdquo;, and do not try to predict market timing. He emphasizes \u0026ldquo;buying and waiting for a chance to rise\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;waiting for a chance to buy\u0026rdquo;. Because the market is difficult to predict, and time is the key factor in compound interest, the earlier you start investing, the more you can enjoy the benefits brought by compound interest. When to sell - don\u0026rsquo;t sell: The author believes that long-term holding is the key to obtaining high returns. He quotes Jesse Livermore, the author of Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, and the investment strategy of Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s richest man, Cai Wanlin, to illustrate the importance of long-term holding. Random walk and efficient market theory: The author introduces the \u0026ldquo;random walk hypothesis\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;efficient market hypothesis\u0026rdquo; to provide a theoretical basis for the strategy of \u0026ldquo;buy casually, buy at any time, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo;. The \u0026ldquo;random walk hypothesis\u0026rdquo; believes that short-term fluctuations in stock prices are random and difficult to predict; the \u0026ldquo;efficient market hypothesis\u0026rdquo; believes that all information in the market is already reflected in stock prices, so it is futile to predict market trends by analyzing information. Investment Iron Law 9: Grasp the General Trend of the Stock Market # Blind spots in prediction and analysis: The author once again emphasizes the limitations of prediction and analysis. He points out that technical analysis and market forecasting cannot guarantee investment success, and may even lead to losses due to frequent trading. Technical analysis is based on historical data, but the market environment is constantly changing, and past performance does not represent future trends. The only thing that can be measured is the unmeasurable: Market trends are difficult to predict. Instead of trying to predict the market, it is better to formulate a reasonable investment strategy and hold it for a long time. The author illustrates the unreliability of prediction with an example of a failed stock market prophet. Believe in yourself rather than experts: The author advises investors not to over-rely on expert opinions and to cultivate their own financial management capabilities and independent judgment. He pointed out that expert opinions often contradict each other, and ten experts may have eleven opinions. Besides, experts may also be influenced by various factors, such as conflicts of interest, and thus give biased opinions. Investment Iron Law 10: Make Good Use of Stock Market Offensive and Defensive Weapons # Value strategy: The core of value strategy is \u0026ldquo;buy when the value is higher than the price, and sell when the value is lower than the price\u0026rdquo;. The author uses the huge difference in the share price of China Development Financial at different times as an example to illustrate the impact of market sentiment on stock prices and the performance of investors\u0026rsquo; irrational behavior. He advises investors to learn rational consumption behavior and buy stocks when the \u0026ldquo;price is discounted\u0026rdquo;. He also points out that the key to value investing is being able to accurately assess the intrinsic value of a company, which requires certain professional knowledge and experience. Growth strategy: The core of the growth strategy is to invest in companies with high growth potential in the future and hold them for the long term. The author uses Peter Lynch\u0026rsquo;s investment strategy and the investment story of the \u0026ldquo;Coca-Cola Grandma\u0026rdquo; as examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the growth strategy. He advises investors to choose companies with high growth potential in the next 5-10 years and focus on choosing the right industry because the growth of the industry will drive the growth of corporate performance. Contrarian strategy: The core of the contrarian strategy is \u0026ldquo;invest when most people are not investing, and sell when most people are eager to invest\u0026rdquo;. The author uses the business philosophy of Fan Li and the investment strategy of Zheng Zhoumin as examples to illustrate the principle of contrarian operation. He pointed out that market sentiment is often wrong. When the market is excessively pessimistic, it is often a good time to buy; when the market is excessively optimistic, it is often a good time to sell. However, contrarian operation is very difficult, and it requires investors to have independent thinking ability and strong psychological quality. Value, growth, and contrarian strategies are suitable for experts: The author summarizes the characteristics of the three strategies and points out that these strategies are more suitable for professional investors. For ordinary investors, the strategy of \u0026ldquo;buy casually, buy at any time, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; is simpler and easier to implement, and it is also easier to obtain long-term and stable returns. Investment Iron Law 11: Don\u0026rsquo;t Do Short-Term Operations # Buy low and sell high is full of crises: The author pointed out that \u0026ldquo;buying low and selling high\u0026rdquo; seems to be the secret to making money from stock investment, but it is actually full of traps. Because no one can accurately predict the short-term fluctuations of the market, trying to make profits through \u0026ldquo;buying low and selling high\u0026rdquo; will often fall into the dilemma of chasing ups and downs, which will eventually lead to losses. He emphasizes that the main source of stock investment income is corporate profits and dividends, not the difference in buying and selling prices. Short-term operation is gambling: The author believes that the essence of short-term operation is speculation and gambling, and it is difficult to make a profit in the long run. Because short-term operations require frequent trading, and each transaction will generate transaction costs, such as commissions, stamp duty, etc. These transaction costs will eat away at investment income, and accumulate over time, will have a significant negative impact on investment returns. A game with no chance of winning: The author analyzes the composition of the stock market, including intermediaries (securities companies, governments, etc.), major shareholders, major players, and retail investors. He pointed out that retail investors are at a clear disadvantage in this game of short-term operations because they lack the advantages of capital, information, and resources. Therefore, retail investors should avoid participating in short-term operations and adopt a long-term investment strategy. Never participate in futures and margin trading: The author strongly recommends that investors not participate in futures and margin trading because these transactions are extremely risky, and the leverage effect will magnify both profits and losses. It is difficult for ordinary investors to control the risks. He uses the example of the Barings Bank collapse to illustrate the huge risks of futures and margin trading. Investment Iron Law 12: Land is Wealth # Why real estate has high returns: The author analyzes the reasons for the high returns of real estate investment, mainly including three aspects: 1. Limited land supply; 2. As the economy grows and the population grows, the demand for real estate continues to increase; 3. Inflation will push up real estate prices. Hong Kong\u0026rsquo;s richest man, Lee Shau Kee\u0026rsquo;s real estate investment strategy: The author introduces the real estate investment strategy of Hong Kong\u0026rsquo;s richest man, Lee Shau Kee: acquire old buildings at low prices, then demolish and rebuild them, or hold land for a long time and wait for appreciation. Cai Wanlin\u0026rsquo;s secret to getting rich in real estate: The author uses Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s richest man, Cai Wanlin, as an example to illustrate the real estate investment strategy of \u0026ldquo;buy and hold for the long term.\u0026rdquo; Cai Wanlin\u0026rsquo;s secret is to buy real estate and hold it for a long time, only renting and not selling. Zheng Zhoumin\u0026rsquo;s real estate investment technique: The author introduces the real estate investment strategy of the Philippines\u0026rsquo; richest man, Zheng Zhoumin: buy when the market is down, and hold it for a long time, waiting for the market to recover and prices to rise. Real estate is suitable for debt investment: The author believes that real estate investment is suitable for debt investment because the long-term investment return rate of real estate is usually higher than the loan interest rate. Through reasonable debt investment, financial leverage can be used to magnify returns. At the same time, he also reminds readers to live within their means and avoid the risks brought by excessive debt. Brand concept of real estate investment: The author emphasizes the importance of choosing real estate developers with good brands, guaranteed quality, and good after-sales service. He pointed out that buying a property is a major investment decision, and choosing a reputable developer can reduce investment risks and enhance the living experience. Investment Iron Law 13: Act Now # It is better to act than to sit and study: The author once again emphasizes the importance of action. He believes that having knowledge without taking action is equivalent to not having knowledge. The key to financial management is action, not fantasy. He uses the story of a farmer who does not understand stocks but dares to buy and eventually make a profit as an example to illustrate the importance of action. Future wealth is in your own hands: The author points out that future wealth is in your own hands, and only active actions can create wealth. He encourages readers to overcome their fear and bravely take the first step in financial management. Financial experience - learn from mistakes: The author believes that failure is the mother of success, and you must dare to try and learn from your mistakes. He advises readers to start with small investments, gradually accumulate experience, and gradually improve their risk tolerance. The first step in learning financial management: The author suggests that readers start acting immediately after reading this book. They can start by investing a small amount in stocks or mutual funds, or they can buy a self-occupied property. He believes that the best way to learn financial management is to practice, accumulate experience in practice, and continue to learn and improve. The Ultimate Chapter of Financial Management: Making Money Requires a Goal # Don\u0026rsquo;t be a miser: The author uses the story of a miser to illustrate that money is only a means, and improving the quality of life is the goal. He warns readers not to become slaves to money, to learn to enjoy life, and to use wealth for more meaningful things. What is the purpose of making so much money?: The author explores the meaning and values of money. He pointed out that money itself is not good or bad, the key is how to use it. Money can be used to improve lives, pursue dreams, help others, and give back to society. He encourages readers to establish correct values about money, not to blindly pursue wealth, and ignore other aspects of life. Three secrets of financial management - making money, managing money, and using money: The author proposes three levels of financial management: making money, managing money, and using money. He believes that making money is the foundation, managing money is the key, and using money is the purpose. These three levels are indispensable, and only by combining the three can you truly achieve financial freedom and live a happy life. He pointed out that how to use money is the most difficult because it involves personal values and life goals. American billionaire - Warren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s view of money: The author introduces Warren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s view of money and estate planning. Although Buffett is extremely wealthy, he lives a simple life and donates most of his estate to charity. He believes that happiness is a process, not a result. True happiness lies in constant pursuit and creation, not in how much wealth you have. Summary: The author summarizes the core viewpoints of the book: Everyone can achieve wealth through financial management. The key lies in having the correct concept of financial management, long-term investment, and positive actions. He encourages readers to set clear financial goals and formulate feasible financial plans based on their actual situations. He emphasizes that the ultimate goal of financial management is not to have unlimited wealth, but to achieve financial freedom, improve the quality of life, and ultimately realize the value of life.

Furthermore, anyone can achieve wealth through personal finance. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to be rich, have a high income, possess a high degree, have specialized knowledge or advanced skills, nor rely on luck. What you need is the desire for wealth, a correct investment philosophy (not just techniques), and the patience to wait for the long term. Therefore, whether a person has money or not, or how high their income is, doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. What truly influences a person\u0026rsquo;s future wealth is whether they have started managing their finances. This endeavor is not easy, but it\u0026rsquo;s undoubtedly worth your effort!\nReaders, please immediately review your current asset allocation. Is too much of your capital sitting in bank accounts or other \u0026ldquo;guaranteed return\u0026rdquo; investments? Is your investment portfolio sufficiently diversified? Do you frequently buy and sell in the stock market?\nAfter understanding your asset allocation, you should earnestly plan your financial goals and follow these five principles:\n1. Clearly define the amount of wealth you hope to achieve and keep it in mind at all times. Simply thinking \u0026ldquo;I want to be rich\u0026rdquo; is not enough.\n2. Set a specific date for achieving your goal.\n3. Determine what price you\u0026rsquo;re willing to pay and what actions you\u0026rsquo;ll take to reach your ideal goal.\n4. Think about your goal at least twice a day to reinforce your belief.\n5. Take action, whether you feel completely ready or not.\nIn Appendix II, readers can use the wealth creation formula and examples provided to calculate how to achieve their financial goals.\nYour future wealth depends on what you do today. Don\u0026rsquo;t let unnecessary hesitation cast a shadow on your heart. As long as you understand investment and financial management, you too can become wealthy in the future. Everyone possesses the necessary ingredients for wealth creation: a small amount of capital and a God-given resource—time. As long as you are willing to learn about personal finance, you have the potential to become a multi-millionaire.\nWhen you find people around you feeling lost due to a lack of vision for the future, share with them the \u0026ldquo;¥14,000 a year for 40 years can make you a multi-millionaire\u0026rdquo; formula and help them reignite their hope.\nFinancial Dependence Is Your Own Responsibility\nThe unequal distribution of wealth in today\u0026rsquo;s society is increasingly severe. Some blame flawed policies, others point to artificial market manipulation. I believe neither is the primary cause. One of the main reasons for the wealth gap is the disparity in financial literacy among people.\nThe reason for poverty in modern times is not so much insufficient income, lack of thrift, or excessive spending, but rather improper financial management. In modern society, achieving financial independence after the age of 40 is a fundamental responsibility for everyone. Whether you want to or not, or whether you like it or not, investment and financial management have become essential knowledge for modern individuals. Remember, with our current income levels and investment opportunities, \u0026ldquo;remaining poor after 40\u0026rdquo; is self-inflicted, and \u0026ldquo;not being a multi-millionaire after 70\u0026rdquo; is due to a lack of financial knowledge.\nAdvances in modern medicine have increased human life expectancy, leading to an aging society. Longer lifespans are a blessing, but enjoying a comfortable retirement is even more crucial. We must accumulate sufficient wealth to secure our lives in old age.\nEffortless Personal Finance, Enjoy the Process\nFrom the examples provided in this article, we can see that those who are good at managing their finances understand how to invest their assets in stocks and real estate with high long-term returns, and they avoid unnecessary short-term trading, thus achieving wealth with ease. Those who are not good at managing their finances either focus solely on saving and keeping their assets in \u0026ldquo;safe\u0026rdquo; bank deposits or try to get rich quickly by engaging in short-term trading in the stock or futures markets. These individuals will eventually be left far behind in the race for financial success.\nMost people keep their assets in financial institutions without investing them, and when they do start investing, they aim for quick riches. As a result, their money stagnates in banks, and their pursuit of quick wealth often leads to substantial losses. They fail to realize that with a little courage, by investing in stocks and real estate and patiently waiting for decades, they can naturally achieve wealth.\nSimply put, building wealth through personal finance only requires two things: investing your capital in areas with high returns and having the patience to wait for the long term. The required investment is low, the probability of success is high, and the process is relaxed and enjoyable.\nI advise readers not to rush to get rich through investment, causing anxiety and ultimately achieving the opposite of what they desire. By following the methods described in this book, you can achieve financial success without expending excessive time and energy, allowing you to focus on your existing career.\nPersonal finance is a marathon, not a sprint. If you view the entire process from a long-term perspective, temporary setbacks don\u0026rsquo;t signify failure, and momentary gains don\u0026rsquo;t guarantee lasting success. With this mindset, you can maintain a more open perspective and avoid becoming overly attached to gains and losses.\nI admit that consistently buying assets and holding them long-term can make personal finance seem dull and unbearable. However, before engaging in any financial activities, investors must clarify their objectives: is it to build wealth or to seek the thrill of gambling? Personal finance can not only lead to wealth but also bring joy and knowledge. Everyone should learn how to manage their finances and find enjoyment in the process.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Feel Guilty About Being Wealthy\nWealth should be acquired and used ethically. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to apologize to others for your wealth. Only the pursuit of wealth through unscrupulous means is sinful and unfortunate. Therefore, everyone should not only be confident but also feel obligated to earn wealth. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to be secretive or ashamed about pursuing wealth. On the contrary, being financially dependent is a burden on society. Moreover, wealthy individuals are more capable of contributing to society. In short, if you can\u0026rsquo;t find a good reason why getting rich is bad, why not allow yourself to become wealthy?\nYou earning more in the investment market doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean others will earn less or lose more. If everyone is proficient in managing their finances, not only can individuals prosper, but economic resources can also be utilized effectively, leading to rapid overall economic growth. In a market economy, the wealth of society is built upon the wealth of its people. Only a prosperous populace can create a prosperous economy.\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s financially driven world, whether for personal advancement or the benefit of society as a whole, everyone should strengthen their understanding of personal finance. When everyone is skilled in managing their finances, individuals and families can live prosperous lives, the wealth gap can be narrowed, and the nation can progress and flourish.\nAction Speaks Louder Than Words\n\u0026ldquo;Knowing and not doing is not knowing.\u0026rdquo; The biggest obstacle to personal finance is not that it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to do, but that it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to start. The key to overcoming this is to act immediately. One of the main reasons for failure in personal finance is avoiding decisions. However, if you want to achieve your goal of building wealth through investment, there\u0026rsquo;s no other way than to take action.\nAfter reading the basic principles of investment and financial management outlined in this article, you should understand that building wealth is not only achievable but also not difficult. So, act now! Time is money. The earlier you start, the sooner you\u0026rsquo;ll reach your financial goals and share the fruits of your labor with your family.\nLooking ahead, changes in society, politics, economics, and finance will accelerate, and the resulting redistribution of wealth will inevitably follow suit. For yourself, your family, and society as a whole, managing your finances is a role everyone should embrace.\nPersistence Is Key\nFor readers seeking quick riches, this book might disappoint you. A more accurate title would be: \u0026ldquo;How to Invest and Manage Your Finances to Slowly but Steadily Build Wealth.\u0026rdquo;\nMany believe that successful people are infallible—never failing, never experiencing losses. Many also think they must be omniscient and possess sufficient knowledge before they can start investing and managing their finances. Our most common flaw is our unwillingness to try repeatedly and to persevere. Building wealth through personal finance is not difficult! The reason most people don\u0026rsquo;t achieve their goals is their inability to persevere and their lack of patience.\nPersistence is essential for success in personal finance. Suppose you embark on a wealth-building plan and encounter setbacks along the way. Don\u0026rsquo;t be discouraged. Some people regularly save and invest annually. When prices rise, they are satisfied and continue their plan. But when prices fall, they panic and abandon their investment strategy. They fail to understand that price fluctuations are inherent in the investment market, and investment results will inevitably fluctuate.\nIf, midway through your financial plan, you succumb to the temptation to spend your investment capital or give up due to repeated setbacks, all your previous efforts will be wasted. Success in personal finance depends on endurance and resolve: endurance to delay gratification and resist immediate consumption temptations; and resolve to withstand significant wealth fluctuations over long periods without losing your composure. As long as you have perseverance and resolve, trust in compound interest, and believe in the \u0026ldquo;wealth creation formula,\u0026rdquo; the ultimate wealth will undoubtedly be yours.\n\u0026ldquo;No dreams, no wealth.\u0026rdquo; Those who build wealth through personal finance must be driven by desire and ambition. They also need sufficient courage, knowledge, patience, and perseverance. A lack of courage, flawed methods, impatience, or giving up halfway will not work. Whether you can achieve wealth and financial independence in the future depends entirely on your actions and efforts today.\nUnlock Your Hidden Wealth Potential\nBelieve it or not, the price of living a wealthy and successful life is no greater than the price of living a poor and miserable one. Achieving this depends entirely on wisdom, belief, and action. After reading this book, readers should understand that everyone can achieve wealth through personal finance. The reason most people are not wealthy is not due to low income, but rather a lack of understanding of how to create wealth through investment and financial management. The primary purpose of this book is to help everyone unlock their hidden wealth potential.\nIf, after reading this book, you still cannot effectively apply these investment principles to manage your money and improve your financial situation, then this book is a complete failure. Financial education is not merely about imparting knowledge; its significance lies in genuinely changing the reader\u0026rsquo;s financial behavior.\nThis is a book of action, not a textbook for enhancing investment knowledge or a \u0026ldquo;decorative book\u0026rdquo; for your bookshelf. This book aims to inspire readers to change their mindset and behavior. Its success depends on readers taking action based on the core principles presented, breaking free from mediocrity, and embarking on the path to wealth. Therefore, at the end of most chapters, key points are summarized for readers to reflect upon and apply.\nInvestment and financial management can not only lead to wealth but also bring joy to investors. Everyone should learn how to manage their finances and reap the substantial rewards. I believe most readers already possess the basic requirements for building wealth: a small amount of capital, sufficient time, and the investment knowledge gained from this book. The world of personal finance, full of changes and opportunities, awaits you. It is filled with treasures and pitfalls. Don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate, and don\u0026rsquo;t leave empty-handed.\nThe principles of building wealth through investment and financial management are neither profound nor mysterious. They are absolutely achievable for everyone, and many have indeed easily become wealthy through these methods. As we\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned before, \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re willing to learn, managing your finances is as simple as walking.\u0026rdquo;\nAmong the financial principles presented in this book, you\u0026rsquo;ll find many that contradict deeply ingrained investment concepts and financial habits, and some even go against human nature. Therefore, to realize the ideal of wealth creation through investment and financial management, the first step is to break free from some \u0026ldquo;deep-rooted and misguided\u0026rdquo; investment concepts, common knowledge, and habits. Almost none of these concepts and principles are easy to achieve. Therefore, I advise readers to not only read each chapter carefully but also to review, reflect, establish strict rules, and ultimately change their behavior.\nWealth Is a Means to a Better Life\nFinally, this book must emphasize that wealth is not the purpose of life, but a means to create a better life. The ultimate goal of investment and financial management is not just to become rich, but to use wealth to realize your life\u0026rsquo;s aspirations. Therefore, a fulfilling and balanced life is the starting point for personal finance.\nEveryone should actively and optimistically plan and execute their lifelong financial journey. Based on the principles we\u0026rsquo;ve presented, everyone can achieve substantial wealth through personal finance without sacrificing time, energy, work, or life. However, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to remember that only those who balance career, life, health, family, and wealth can be considered truly successful in managing their finances. Those who gain the world\u0026rsquo;s riches but lose their health, family, and the meaning of life cannot be considered truly successful. In today\u0026rsquo;s society, many are lost in the pursuit of wealth, sacrificing more valuable things in life. Therefore, this principle of balancing personal finance and life is particularly important and deserves careful consideration.\nAlthough this book repeatedly emphasizes that success in personal finance depends on mindset, time, and action, not luck, I still congratulate you, the reader, on being fortunate enough to encounter this book. By adhering to the investment principles within, you are sure to become a multi-millionaire in the decades to come!\n","date":"15 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005974/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Conclusion","type":"posts"},{"content":" The Ultimate Guide to Wealth Management: Earning Money Requires a Goal # Money is merely a means; improving the quality of life is the ultimate goal. Success is getting what you want, then enjoying what you have.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Be a Miser # A miser sold all his possessions, deposited the money in a bank, and took great satisfaction in calculating his daily interest earnings. His unscrupulous son, noticing his father\u0026rsquo;s secretive behavior, discovered the large bank deposit. He stole the passbook and seal, withdrew all the money, and replaced the original with a forgery. The miser, unaware of the deception, continued to calculate his imaginary wealth and interest.\nNot Spending Money Is Like Having No Money\nMonths later, a sudden urge led the miser to the bank, where he discovered his account was empty. Devastated, he returned home, where his son consoled him: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be so upset. Just pretend the passbook is real. It serves the same purpose. You can still calculate your wealth daily. Money sitting unused in a bank is the same as having no money.\u0026rdquo; This parable satirizes the miser to emphasize the true meaning of wealth. Hoarding money without utilizing it is no different from having none. Wealth, in any form, has no inherent meaning. Its value comes from what we ascribe to it and how we use it to live the life we want.\n\u0026ldquo;My philosophy is to live a simple life, be humble, and what significance does money hold for me?\u0026rdquo; Li Ka-shing, despite his immense wealth, focuses on making more money and training his successors – his two sons, Victor and Richard.\nWealthy Taiwanese tycoons seem to follow a similar pattern, leaving all their wealth to the next generation, even surpassing Li Ka-shing in their simple lifestyles. Tsai Wan-lin, once Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s richest man, drove a Yulon car and ate nutritionally balanced but bland meals prepared by doctors. Even in his 70s, he went to work every day, saying, \u0026ldquo;The thought of paying NT$20 million in salaries every day compels me to come to the office.\u0026rdquo;\nTaiwan has many such \u0026ldquo;miserly\u0026rdquo; tycoons. Wang Yung-ching, the founder of Formosa Plastics Group, was known for his frugality, even combining leftover soap scraps. He said, \u0026ldquo;Food needs only to be nutritious, not necessarily luxurious. Simple meals are good. Constant luxury makes one forget what happiness is.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can live like an emperor or a commoner,\u0026rdquo; said Huang Shih-hui, chairman of the Chinfon Group and a consistent top taxpayer in Taiwan. \u0026ldquo;Even if I lost a third, or even half of my wealth, I could still live well.\u0026rdquo; Ranked Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s sixth richest man by Fortune magazine, Huang ate NT$50 lunches and drove an ordinary car. He said, \u0026ldquo;How much can I wear? How much can I eat? Excessive desire will kill you!\u0026rdquo; For these wealthy individuals, the meaning of earning so much lies in the sense of accomplishment, not enjoyment.\nBe the Master of Your Money\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t master your money, your money will master you.\nIf asked, \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the next step after earning money?\u0026rdquo; most people would instinctively answer, \u0026ldquo;Spending it!\u0026rdquo; They\u0026rsquo;re wrong. Those who answer this way usually haven\u0026rsquo;t earned much. Most self-made millionaires continue to earn after becoming wealthy.\nSome might say, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s foolish to have money and not spend it!\u0026rdquo; True, but such misers are not uncommon. Studies show that at least 90% of people continue to accumulate wealth, becoming slaves to money.\nBy now, you should realize that achieving financial wealth is relatively easy. Avoid keeping all your money in the bank, invest most of it in stocks or real estate, and be patient. However, teaching you to become a billionaire only to become a miserly hoarder is not my intention. Therefore, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to discuss the meaning of wealth and the reasons for pursuing it.\nUndeniably, with today\u0026rsquo;s opportunities and living standards, hard work can ensure a comfortable life. This book demonstrates that with proper financial management, wealth is attainable. However, without prior reflection on the meaning of wealth, you may become complacent, give up, or, even worse, become wealthy but not know how to use your money. This benefits no one. Before embarking on the path to riches, ask yourself what wealth means to you, then determine the steps to achieve it.\n1. Don\u0026rsquo;t be a miser. Learn to spend wisely after earning. 2. Before pursuing wealth, understand your values regarding it.\nMoney, a double-edged sword, has corrupted countless souls throughout history. Poverty, a solitary grave, has buried countless heroes and talents.\nWhy Earn So Much? # Everyone desires wealth. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that why you bought and are reading this book? Yet, not everyone prioritizes wealth. We often hear sentiments like: \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t take it with you,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Wealth is fleeting,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;One can only eat three meals a day, wear one outfit, and one pair of shoes. Why earn so much?\u0026rdquo;\nIf you say, \u0026ldquo;Why bother with financial management if you don\u0026rsquo;t want wealth?\u0026rdquo; I have nothing more to say. This book is explicitly for those seeking financial independence and wealth.\nThe desire for wealth is a personal choice, determined by one\u0026rsquo;s values and perspective on money. Some see it as a tool, content with enough to meet their needs; others view it as the root of all evil, associating the pursuit of wealth with something ignoble. Undeniably, the single-minded pursuit of money is wrong. Life offers many other valuable pursuits: health, knowledge, family, love, friendship – all precious.\nMoney isn\u0026rsquo;t everything. We often hear, \u0026ldquo;If money can solve it, it\u0026rsquo;s a simple problem.\u0026rdquo; While not the most important thing in life, its importance is undeniable. As the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;Money isn\u0026rsquo;t everything, but without it, you can do nothing.\u0026rdquo; A good life requires money, as does education, a higher quality of life, improving family life, and even philanthropy. The New England Journal of Medicine points out that the wealthy live longer, healthier lives than the poor.\nMany aspire to a happy life and giving back to society. Both require money. Thus, money is a necessary means to achieve life goals. You can disdain money, but you can\u0026rsquo;t deny its utility in today\u0026rsquo;s society.\nOne\u0026rsquo;s status and worth are often judged by wealth. It\u0026rsquo;s unfair, but true. Despite the absence of social classes, money divides people into \u0026ldquo;rich\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;poor.\u0026rdquo; Greater wealth translates to greater ability to acquire desired possessions, status, and lifestyles.\nMoney undoubtedly buys the best healthcare, food, clothing, and housing. It provides security and freedom from fear, improving the quality of life and making it more vibrant. The poor have limited options, while the rich enjoy a wider range of experiences.\nMoney Can Ruin the Next Generation\nThe easiest way to ruin your children? Leave them a fortune. The saying \u0026ldquo;Wealth doesn\u0026rsquo;t last three generations\u0026rdquo; reflects this truth.\nMany educators and I share a common experience: the most challenging students lack motivation, often stemming from wealthy backgrounds. These children, wanting for nothing, don\u0026rsquo;t understand the need for hard work or ambition.\nI recall a case during my tenure as director of the Graduate Institute of Business Administration at Tunghai University. A student, admitted after fierce competition, struggled academically and seemed listless. During counseling, I inquired about learning difficulties.\nHis response: \u0026ldquo;My engineering background makes these courses easy. I don\u0026rsquo;t understand why I need to learn this.\u0026rdquo; I explained that business school teaches profit maximization. He replied, \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the point of making money?\u0026rdquo; Shocked, I learned that his family\u0026rsquo;s wealth had shielded him from financial concerns, leaving him without a drive to earn. I then emphasized the value of business management for future employment. His response: \u0026ldquo;My father owns a factory waiting for me, but I don\u0026rsquo;t want it.\u0026rdquo; He didn\u0026rsquo;t appreciate what he already had. I asked about his apparent preoccupation. Reluctantly, he confessed his biggest worry: \u0026ldquo;Why can humans kill animals, but not the other way around?\u0026rdquo; I truly didn\u0026rsquo;t understand the mindset of the wealthy\u0026rsquo;s offspring. It reminded me of the Taiwanese saying: \u0026ldquo;Some complain of hunger after a full meal.\u0026rdquo;\nWe should be grateful if our parents didn\u0026rsquo;t leave us a fortune that robbed us of our drive. This book shows how financial management can lead to wealth. However, I caution against leaving excessive wealth to your children.\nIdeally, set a financial goal and stop actively pursuing wealth after reaching it. Avoid becoming a lifelong slave to money, and don\u0026rsquo;t ruin your children\u0026rsquo;s future.\nWarren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s Perspective on Money\nBillionaire Warren Buffett has arranged his estate to be managed by a trust controlled by wise individuals with absolute authority and no restrictions. He avoids preconditions, hoping to prevent it from becoming a bureaucratic, traditional fund. He said, \u0026ldquo;If they create a lofty palace and become conservative and closed-minded, my ghost will not let them rest.\u0026rdquo;\nBuffett left his children $3 million each, and they now live happily as farmers. I admire his perspective: \u0026ldquo;True happiness isn\u0026rsquo;t living in a palace but adding a room to your house each year, because happiness is a process, not a result.\u0026rdquo;\nBuffett\u0026rsquo;s estate planning is unique. As America\u0026rsquo;s richest man, his financial decisions draw attention. Some criticize his perceived stinginess towards philanthropy. He countered, \u0026ldquo;When I die, societal problems will remain. Society will benefit more from my wealth then than now.\u0026rdquo; He remains steadfast despite public opinion.\nBuffett essentially ensures that his wealth, acquired from society, returns to it upon his death – a remarkably detached approach compared to many Eastern tycoons.\nAcquiring wealth is difficult. Maintaining wealth is harder. Utilizing wealth is the hardest.\nThe Three Keys to Wealth Management: Earning, Managing, and Utilizing # Wealth management comprises three levels: earning, managing, and utilizing money. Technically, earning is the hardest, followed by managing, then utilizing. However, my experience as a financial advisor suggests that teaching people how to earn is difficult, teaching them to manage is harder, and teaching them to utilize is the hardest.\nFew Spend Wisely\nSome challenge this: \u0026ldquo;Spending is easy! Give me your money, and I\u0026rsquo;ll spend it all quickly.\u0026rdquo; True, spending other people\u0026rsquo;s money is easy; spending your life\u0026rsquo;s earnings is not. Many wealthy individuals struggle to use their money meaningfully.\nMany lifelong savers find it incredibly difficult to change their habits and spend appropriately, even after becoming wealthy. When asked, \u0026ldquo;What are you saving for?\u0026rdquo; they often reply, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo;\nMany people tirelessly pursue wealth without clarifying their goals. They blindly follow the mantra \u0026ldquo;Money is important.\u0026rdquo; No one takes their wealth to the grave. Many become so consumed with earning that they forget their initial purpose, mistaking the means for the end. They fail to use their wealth for greater happiness, joy, or societal good, becoming slaves to money. Their wealth becomes meaningless, bringing more harm than benefit.\n1. Money is a means to achieve life goals. Don\u0026rsquo;t mistake the means for the end and blindly chase money. 2. Learn to utilize your money to become a truly happy and wealthy individual. 3. Save when young, manage wisely in middle age, and spend thoughtfully in old age.\nThe Wealth Journey of Chen Ding-chuan, Chairman of Everlight Chemical\n\u0026ldquo;Before seeking wealth, cultivate the ability to manage money and control yourself.\u0026rdquo; Chen Ding-chuan believes that those who don\u0026rsquo;t understand how to use money become its slaves, losing themselves in the pursuit. Those who master the art of utilizing money become its masters, prioritizing self-growth and attracting wealth naturally.\nChen founded Everlight Chemical at 40, transforming it from a producer of basic dyes to a supplier of advanced specialty chemicals and pharmaceutical ingredients. By 1995, the company\u0026rsquo;s revenue reached over NT$2.4 billion. A devout Christian and former director of the International Foundation Taiwan, Chen holds a unique perspective on money. He believes earning is easy, but spending wisely is not. He\u0026rsquo;s witnessed countless wealthy individuals squander their fortunes and lose themselves, while others hoard their wealth, living like paupers and inflicting misery on those around them. He believes most people don\u0026rsquo;t understand how to use money.\nDeeply religious, Chen dedicates himself to God and spreading the Gospel. Despite his success, he\u0026rsquo;s traveled a difficult path. He left school after elementary to work, studying diligently at night school for seven years, never missing a class except due to illness. While others took on extra jobs, he prioritized education, graduating with a degree in international trade at 35. Who would have predicted his future as a billionaire?\nWho Paid the Highest Estate Tax?\n\u0026ldquo;Who paid the highest estate tax in Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s history?\u0026rdquo; I often ask this during lectures. Few know the correct answer: Chen De-shen.\n\u0026ldquo;Chen De-shen? Who is he?\u0026rdquo; Audiences always murmur after the reveal. It\u0026rsquo;s a shame that someone who paid nearly NT$2 billion in estate tax remains relatively unknown. How? The only explanation is that Chen mastered earning and managing money, but not utilizing it.\nChen died in 1991, leaving an estate valued at NT$10 billion, resulting in a record NT$1.9 billion estate tax bill. He lived a remarkably frugal life, using public transportation, sleeping on a cot, and living in his office to avoid buying a house. His sister recounted how he even refused to replace worn-out underwear.\nUnmarried and childless, his vast fortune went to his siblings, sparking a highly publicized inheritance dispute. He exemplifies the saying, \u0026ldquo;Those enslaved by wealth are pitiable even in their riches.\u0026rdquo;\nI often wonder, had he allocated a portion of his wealth to establish a \u0026ldquo;De-shen College\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;De-shen Hospital,\u0026rdquo; or donated even 1% (NT$100 million) to Tunghai University\u0026rsquo;s business school, his name would be remembered for generations. Such philanthropy would have benefited society and avoided family conflict.\nStanford University, a prestigious institution nestled between San Francisco and Silicon Valley, owes its existence to a generous donation from the Stanford family a century ago. What a profound and lasting impact! We marvel at the wisdom and foresight behind such giving.\n","date":"15 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005973/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Wealth Management","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"15 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/quality-of-life/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Quality of Life","type":"tags"},{"content":" Appendix 1: Understanding Compound Interest # Accumulating wealth isn\u0026rsquo;t about cutting expenses,\nbut about the compounding power of money making money.\nAlbert Einstein, considered one of history\u0026rsquo;s greatest scientists, was once asked, \u0026ldquo;What is the most powerful force in the world?\u0026rdquo; His answer wasn\u0026rsquo;t the force of colliding planets or the power of a nuclear explosion, but \u0026ldquo;compound interest.\u0026rdquo;\nAs the previous examples demonstrate, the factor that allows a yearly saving of 14,000 yuan to grow to over 100 million yuan in 40 years is \u0026ldquo;compound interest.\u0026rdquo; Since compound interest is the primary driver of accelerated wealth growth, understanding it is crucial for achieving financial success.\nImagine two job offers: one with a monthly salary of 100,000 yuan, and another starting at 1 yuan in the first month, doubling each subsequent month. Assuming both jobs last two years (24 months), which would you choose?\nAt first glance, the first offer seems better. 100,000 yuan monthly yields 2.4 million yuan over 24 months. However, anyone understanding compound interest would choose the second job, which yields over 16.77 million yuan after 24 months! This is the effect of compounding. While this is an extreme example, such high growth rates are unlikely in reality. Nevertheless, it clearly demonstrates the power of compound interest.\nMost people have a basic understanding of compound interest. Depositing money in a bank generates interest over time, a common understanding in modern society. Since Einstein considered compound interest the most powerful force, and it can help us become millionaires with modest investments, a deeper understanding of its workings is essential, especially for those interested in financial management.\nSimply put, compound interest is \u0026ldquo;interest on interest.\u0026rdquo; We know bank deposits earn interest, calculated using compound interest. For instance, with a 10% interest rate, a 1,000 yuan deposit earns 100 yuan in interest in the first year, resulting in 1,100 yuan. If left in the bank, the second year\u0026rsquo;s interest is 110 yuan (on 1,100 yuan), totaling 1,210 yuan. The third year yields 121 yuan in interest, reaching 1,331 yuan.\nNotice the increasing interest earned each year. This is because the first year\u0026rsquo;s interest earns interest in the second year, and so on, leading to an ever-increasing return. This \u0026ldquo;interest on interest\u0026rdquo; phenomenon is compound interest.\nThe table below shows that after the 26th year, the annual interest earned surpasses the principal, and by the 40th year, the interest of 4,114 yuan is more than four times the initial 1,000 yuan principal.\nFuture Value of 1,000 Yuan at 10% Interest Rate (Compounded Annually)\nYear Beginning Value Ending Value Interest 1 1000 1100 100 2 1100 1210 110 3 1210 1331 121 \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 26 10835 11918 1083 \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 39 37404 41145 3740 40 41145 45259 4114 Compound interest\u0026rsquo;s effect varies with different interest rates and durations. These variations are presented in compound interest tables (refer to this appendix). These tables, composed of interest rates, years, and future value factors (the growth multiplier calculated by the formula), might seem daunting with their numerous figures. However, understanding them is invaluable for investment and financial management. Renowned American financial advisor Venita VanCaspel calls the compound interest table the \u0026ldquo;eighth wonder of the world.\u0026rdquo; If you don\u0026rsquo;t have the opportunity to travel the world, studying this table can be just as rewarding. Understanding the characteristics of compound interest is key to leveraging its power for wealth creation.\nThe compound interest table reveals that the values increase with time and interest rate. However, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the whole story. Observing compound interest graphs derived from these tables reveals further insights. Figure 1-1 assumes a yearly deposit of 1 yuan at different interest rates, plotting asset growth over 10 years. Figure 1-2 uses the same assumptions but extends the time horizon to 40 years.\nFigure 1-1: Future Value Growth of 1 Yuan Annuity at Different Interest Rates over 10 Years\nFigure 1-2: Future Value Growth of 1 Yuan Annuity at Different Interest Rates over 40 Years\nThese graphs illustrate the growth of 1 yuan over time at various interest rates and durations. Comparing them reveals two key characteristics of compound interest:\nAs the duration (time) increases, the future value rises continuously, and the rate of increase accelerates. This is known as exponential growth. Given sufficient time, the growth becomes dramatic, with the curve eventually approaching a straight upward line. Different interest rates result in significantly different growth curves. Over decades, the disparity between high and low interest rate curves becomes immense. In summary, the secret to accumulating significant wealth from small beginnings lies in leveraging the \u0026ldquo;money making money\u0026rdquo; power of compound interest. Compounding has two key features: its effect is more pronounced over longer periods, and higher returns amplify its impact. Applying these principles to investing leads to two conclusions:\nInvest in high-return assets like stocks and real estate. Higher returns maximize the effect of compounding, while low returns yield minimal benefits. To fully harness the power of compound interest, capital must be invested in high-return assets. Hold investments long-term. The longer the investment horizon, the more significant the compounding effect. Short-term investments don\u0026rsquo;t allow sufficient time for compounding to work its magic. Therefore, long-term holdings in high-return assets are crucial for maximizing the benefits of compound interest. Appendix 2: Blueprint for Financial Success # Everyone\u0026rsquo;s age, personality, and applicable tax rates differ. Therefore, each individual needs a tailored approach to wealth accumulation. I can\u0026rsquo;t provide personalized financial planning advice based on your specific circumstances, nor can I encompass everyone\u0026rsquo;s financial situation and plans with a few generic examples.\nTo help you design your own \u0026ldquo;Blueprint for Financial Success,\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve combined the future value and annuity future value formulas from finance to create a universal \u0026ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula.\u0026rdquo; This formula empowers readers to plan their lifelong financial strategies based on their unique circumstances and objectives.\nFuture Wealth=Current Wealth×(1+R)n+Annual Savings×(1+R)n−1R=Current Wealth×Future Value Factor+Annual Savings×Annuity Future Value FactorWhere:n:Number of yearsR:Average annual investment rate of return\nThe values for the complex calculations in the formula above (Future Value Factor and Annuity Future Value Factor) can be found in Appendix 1 of this book.\nFuture Value Factor: The future value of 1 yuan today, after N years, at an interest rate (or rate of return) of R%. Annuity Future Value Factor: The future value of an annuity of 1 yuan deposited at the end of each year, after N years, at an interest rate (or rate of return) of R%. Using this formula, you can project your future wealth by inputting your current assets, average annual savings for investment, planned investment period, and expected annual rate of return. You can calculate the result or look it up in a table.\nThis formula simplifies the real-world situation, as investment returns are unlikely to remain constant each year, and annual savings might fluctuate. However, using the \u0026ldquo;average\u0026rdquo; annual rate of return and \u0026ldquo;average\u0026rdquo; annual investment amount generally provides a reasonable approximation of future wealth.\nThe purpose of the \u0026ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t to predict future wealth precisely but to illustrate how investment builds wealth and how financial management leads to prosperity. It aims to bolster your confidence in financial planning, enabling you to focus on key principles, maintain perseverance, and steadily progress towards your financial goals throughout market fluctuations.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t a foolproof formula for riches. Following this method may lead to becoming a millionaire, but success isn\u0026rsquo;t guaranteed. However, inaction guarantees zero chance of success. The most valuable aspect of this wealth-building concept is the message: \u0026ldquo;Investment and financial management can lead to wealth.\u0026rdquo; This knowledge fosters optimism and hope. Regardless of your current wealth, age, annual savings, or investment skills, with dedication, determination, and a willingness to learn, you can leverage investing to grow your wealth.\nAfter understanding this formula, follow these steps for financial planning:\nI. Data Collection:\nWhat is your current total asset value? (Include bank deposits, stocks, real estate, etc.) How much do you anticipate saving annually for investment? What is your expected average annual investment rate of return? How many years do you plan to invest before reaching your financial goal? What is your future wealth target? II. Calculation and Analysis:\nUse the five data points above with the \u0026ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula\u0026rdquo; to assess the feasibility of your wealth plan. If it\u0026rsquo;s not feasible, how will you adjust? Will you increase savings? Improve investment skills to boost returns? Lower your wealth target? Or extend your time horizon? Adjust the variables and recalculate until you find a realistic and achievable plan. Calculate your projected accumulated wealth based on your current assets, investment period, annual savings, and expected rate of return. You can also use any four of the five variables (current wealth, target year, annual savings, rate of return, wealth target) to calculate the remaining variable. (Calculating the target year or rate of return using the other four variables requires a financial calculator or trial and error to find an approximate value.) While the \u0026ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula\u0026rdquo; involves a seemingly complex mathematical formula, its primary purpose is to explain the principles of wealth building, not to complicate financial management or confuse readers. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a calculator or prefer not to delve into the formula\u0026rsquo;s calculations, feel free to disregard it.\nUsing the \u0026ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula\u0026rdquo; can help you plan your future finances and boost your confidence in financial management. However, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee investment success. Pre-planning is just the beginning; the key lies in mastering investment principles and consistent action. When starting your financial journey, clarify your financial situation, set realistic wealth goals, then use the \u0026ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula\u0026rdquo; to evaluate your investment strategy and timeline. Remember, the path to wealth is in your hands.\nExample: Zhang San is 30 years old with 200,000 yuan in savings. After reading this book, he resolves to become a millionaire (meaning having 100 million yuan). He plans to invest 100,000 yuan annually in stocks and real estate with an expected 20% annual return, aiming to reach his goal by age 50. Let\u0026rsquo;s use the \u0026ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula\u0026rdquo; to assess the feasibility.\nFuture Wealth=200,000×(1+20%)20+100,000×(1+20%)20−120%=200,000×38.338+100,000×228.98(Corrected Annuity Factor)=30,435,600(Corrected Calculation)\nBased on the calculation, Zhang San\u0026rsquo;s 200,000 yuan initial investment, along with 100,000 yuan annual investments over 20 years at a 20% average return, will yield approximately 26 million yuan, less than one-third of his 100 million yuan goal. To become a millionaire, he can improve his return, increase his annual investment, or extend his time horizon. A 20% return is already quite good and realistic, even for seasoned investors. Increasing his returns further might be challenging. Since he doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to extend the timeline, he decides to increase his annual investment. Through frugality and a part-time job, he manages to save 200,000 yuan annually. Let\u0026rsquo;s recalculate his future wealth after 20 years.\nFuture Wealth=200000×(1+20%)20+200000×(1+20%)2020%−1=200000×38.338+200000×186.96=45005600\nEven with doubled annual savings, his wealth after 20 years still falls short of half his goal. With both his 20% return and 200,000 yuan annual investment maxed out, he has to extend his timeline. He decides to aim for 25 years. Let\u0026rsquo;s calculate his projected wealth then.\nFuture Wealth=200000×(1+20%)25+200000×(1+20%)2520%−1=200000×95.396+200000×471.98=113475200\nHe finally achieves his goal of becoming a millionaire after 25 years. Extending the timeline by just five years makes a significant difference. With a longer time horizon, his required annual investment could be even lower. This example validates the book\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on \u0026ldquo;youth being an asset in wealth building\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;the importance of long-term investing for realizing the power of compound interest.\u0026rdquo; Experiment with different variables to understand their impact. You\u0026rsquo;ll discover that the initial wealth and annual investment amount have a relatively small impact, while time and rate of return are the key drivers of wealth accumulation.\nYour circumstances might be better or worse than Zhang San\u0026rsquo;s. Regardless, everyone has different starting points, but anyone can become a millionaire. Calculate your own path to becoming a millionaire based on your current situation. Remember, with a modest initial investment, allocation to high-return assets like stocks and real estate, and long-term holding, becoming a millionaire is absolutely achievable.\nNow, set your financial goal. Write down your target wealth, your desired timeline, and how you plan to use your wealth to achieve your broader life goals.\nRemember: \u0026ldquo;Money is a means to an end, not the end itself.\u0026rdquo;\nAccumulating more money isn\u0026rsquo;t always better, and having more financial goals isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily advantageous. Such an approach may prevent you from ever reaching your goals and trap you in a cycle of dissatisfaction and greed. You could become a slave to money and potentially harm future generations with excessive wealth, contributing nothing to yourself, your loved ones, or society.\nOnce you have a financial goal, use the \u0026ldquo;Wealth Formula\u0026rdquo; to calculate your path, including required annual savings and average rate of return. This will inform your investment strategy and timeline. More importantly, determine how you will utilize your wealth once you achieve your goal. This concretizes your aspirations. You\u0026rsquo;ll discover that by applying the principles in this book and remaining consistent, becoming a millionaire is within reach. A clear goal leads to a happier life, and a positive attitude contributes to success in all areas of life.\n","date":"15 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005975/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"the Personal Investment Bible: Appendix","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"15 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/values/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Values","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/warren-buffett/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Warren Buffett","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/wealth-building/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Wealth Building","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-15","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E4%BB%B7%E5%80%BC%E8%A7%82/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"价值观","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-15","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/%E7%90%86%E8%B4%A2%E5%9C%A3%E7%BB%8F/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"理财圣经","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-15","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E7%90%86%E8%B4%A2%E5%9C%A3%E7%BB%8F/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"理财圣经","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-15","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E7%94%9F%E6%B4%BB%E5%93%81%E8%B4%A8/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"生活品质","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-15","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E8%87%B4%E5%AF%8C/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"致富","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-15","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E9%81%97%E4%BA%A7/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"遗产","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-15","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E9%87%91%E9%92%B1%E8%A7%82/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"金钱观","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/action/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Action","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/experience/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Experience","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/failure/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Failure","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/financial-leverage/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Financial Leverage","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/inflation/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Inflation","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/leveraged-investment/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Leveraged Investment","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/location-selection/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Location Selection","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/long-term-holding/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Long-Term Holding","type":"tags"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law XIII: Act Now # Those who require a fully justified reason for every action are never practitioners.\nTaking Action is Better Than Just Researching # A group of friends worked hard from sunrise to sunset, but their income remained meager. They envied others who invested in stocks, real estate, or other ventures and became wealthy. They lamented, \u0026ldquo;We toil all day, earning so little, while those investors make easy money.\u0026rdquo; Finally, they decided to seek guidance from an investment guru.\nKnowledge Without Action is Useless\nTouched by their sincerity, the guru agreed to teach them. The first lesson was \u0026ldquo;Investment Principles,\u0026rdquo; covering compound interest, returns, and risk management. The second lesson was \u0026ldquo;Investment Practice,\u0026rdquo; where the guru demonstrated how to invest in stocks, real estate, and other assets. He then asked, \u0026ldquo;Do you understand?\u0026rdquo; They all replied, \u0026ldquo;Yes!\u0026rdquo; The guru said, \u0026ldquo;Congratulations, you\u0026rsquo;ve graduated!\u0026rdquo; The group rejoiced and returned to their jobs.\nDecades later, at a reunion, they complained, \u0026ldquo;Is there any way to make good money? Why do we always have to work so hard?\u0026rdquo; They revisited the guru, who asked, \u0026ldquo;Where did you put your earnings?\u0026rdquo; They answered, \u0026ldquo;In bank savings accounts.\u0026rdquo;\nThis story illustrates that education can change thinking but not necessarily behavior. Possessing knowledge and wisdom without action is no different from lacking them; you\u0026rsquo;ll still rely on physical labor and skills for a living. Wisdom without action is useless; one must be willing to act.\nA survey of wealthy Americans revealed that one of their key traits is \u0026ldquo;proactive action.\u0026rdquo; In other words, financial success depends on what we do, not what we know.\nInvestment professors sometimes face student skepticism: \u0026ldquo;If you know so much, why aren\u0026rsquo;t you rich from investing?\u0026rdquo; A common response is, \u0026ldquo;A teacher\u0026rsquo;s duty is to impart knowledge, not necessarily to practice it. Just like the best coach isn\u0026rsquo;t always the best athlete.\u0026rdquo;\nI often ponder this: Many teachers desire wealth. Wealth accumulation and educating the next generation aren\u0026rsquo;t mutually exclusive. Why don\u0026rsquo;t most investment professors, armed with financial knowledge, become wealthy?\nAnother common question is: \u0026ldquo;Some uneducated, idle speculators get rich through investing without ever taking an investment course. How?\u0026rdquo; The difference between professors and these speculators is simple: some professors know but don\u0026rsquo;t act, while speculators act but don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily know. Financial knowledge alone doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee wealth; action is key.\nAction is the Key to Investment Success\nCan investment skills be taught? No. True skill comes from practice. I often compare investing to ice skating, swimming, or cycling. Can reading books on \u0026ldquo;How to Ice Skate\u0026rdquo; make you a skater? The best teacher is experience – falling hundreds of times, getting back up, and persevering.\nFear is the biggest obstacle to learning about investing. A student once asked, \u0026ldquo;What if I lose all my money before I learn how to invest?\u0026rdquo; I countered, \u0026ldquo;Did you study fluid dynamics before learning to ride a bike, fearing you\u0026rsquo;d crash before mastering it?\u0026rdquo; Investors must understand that even extensive reading won\u0026rsquo;t prevent losses; just like a perfect score in fluid dynamics doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee perfect cycling.\nPractice and experience are essential for practical skills. Investing can\u0026rsquo;t be taught. The key is to step away from books, enter the market, experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them. Start small with a limited amount of money.\nAchieving wealth through investing involves two stages: 1) acquiring correct investment knowledge, and 2) continuous practice and action. Both are essential. Reading this book and understanding the principles is just the first step.\nKnowledge Becomes Power Through Action\nKnowledge is potential power. Only through absorption, internalization, and action does it become real power. \u0026ldquo;Knowledge is power\u0026rdquo; needs amending.\nCorrect understanding alone is insufficient. Achieving wealth requires consistent action and practice. Otherwise, knowledge remains theoretical. Investing is a skill honed through constant practice, like entrepreneur Wang Yung-ching, who continued massive investments in his 70s.\nWe instinctively avoid risk; it\u0026rsquo;s uncomfortable. But investing for wealth requires calculated risks, learned through experience. Dear reader, action is paramount. Initial fear and anxiety are natural. The best way to overcome them is to act.\n1. Those who put ideas and methods into action possess a competitive edge and grasp the opportunity for success.\n2. In today\u0026rsquo;s knowledge-rich world, the biggest obstacle to success is not knowing what to do, but doing what we know.\n3. Many excel at thinking, analyzing, and identifying opportunities, but few act upon them.\nA Farmer Outperforms Market Veterans\nIn early 1996, amid cross-strait tensions, Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s stock market slumped. A farmer walked into a brokerage, placed a bag of cash (around 3-4 million NTD) on the counter, and said, \u0026ldquo;I want to buy San Shang Yin.\u0026rdquo;\nThe clerk, baffled, asked for his account number, which stock he wanted (San Shang Yin refers to three different bank stocks), and his desired price. He knew none of this, saying only, \u0026ldquo;My friend said San Shang Yin is good. Here\u0026rsquo;s the money.\u0026rdquo;\nThe clerk explained the situation, helped him open an account, and bought 10 shares of each bank stock at around 90 NTD. Two months later, the prices rose to 160 NTD.\nThis farmer, lacking knowledge but daring to act, profited. Meanwhile, market experts who thoroughly analyzed San Shang Yin missed out because they hesitated to act.\nDoes knowledge or action bring wealth? The farmer\u0026rsquo;s lack of knowledge might have been his advantage, while overthinking paralyzed the experts. How much do analysis and knowledge truly contribute to wealth creation? It\u0026rsquo;s worth pondering.\nActive action makes dreams come true. A strong desire for wealth fuels action.\nYour Future Wealth is in Your Hands # Many attendees at my seminars nod in agreement but fail to act. Remember, action, not knowledge, determines your future. This book is useless unless you act upon it.\nDreams Alone Won\u0026rsquo;t Make You Rich\nMany dream of wealth, but few succeed. It\u0026rsquo;s not luck or intelligence, but the unity of thought and action. Success and wealth are earned through planning, action, and consistent effort.\nFor most, wealth is a fantasy. They think and talk, but don\u0026rsquo;t act. Some lack the know-how, which is understandable. Sadly, others know but don\u0026rsquo;t act. \u0026ldquo;Knowing and not doing is not knowing.\u0026rdquo; Wealth won\u0026rsquo;t come to those who only dream or accumulate knowledge without action. People attribute wealth to luck, but does luck favor those dreaming at home or those actively seeking opportunities?\nReading this book won\u0026rsquo;t magically make you rich. Financial success depends on what we do. We\u0026rsquo;ve all seen seemingly unintelligent, not particularly hard-working, or frugal people who are wealthy.\nThe difference between self-made millionaires and us isn\u0026rsquo;t intellect, effort, frugality, or knowledge, but where our money is placed. They invest in high-return assets, while we often settle for low returns. Most make excuses: not enough money, time, knowledge, or opportunity, or blaming age. These are merely excuses preventing wealth accumulation.\n1. The principles of financial management are simple; the difficulty lies in overcoming fear, greed, and laziness to do what we know we should.\n2. Investing is an art and a science, but more art. The best way to learn is by doing.\n3. Without putting money to work, you\u0026rsquo;ll rely on physical labor and skills your entire life.\nThe First Step: Open a Brokerage Account and Buy Stocks\nAn elderly British writer lamented, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve seen many talented young people remain obscure, their potential unfulfilled because they lacked the courage to try. Guidance and encouragement to take risks could have unleashed their talents and benefited society.\u0026rdquo;\nOver 13% of seniors in Taiwan rely on continued work or family support. Many ended up this way because they didn\u0026rsquo;t invest in risky assets like stocks or real estate in their youth. Had they been guided to invest wisely, they could be enjoying retirement, reducing social inequality and promoting harmony.\nInspired by this writer, I now encourage my students to open brokerage accounts and buy stocks (or closed-end funds if unsure) on the first day of my investment courses. I advise them to hold long-term, regardless of price fluctuations, aiming for practical experience over theoretical knowledge.\nPaying for Experience\nIn 1983, while pursuing my PhD at UC Berkeley, a Wall Street analyst lectured at the university. I asked him for book recommendations on stock investing. He advised, \u0026ldquo;The best way to learn is to invest. You\u0026rsquo;ll learn more from one real investment than from several books.\u0026rdquo; I followed his advice, lost money, and learned valuable lessons that shaped my future investment approach.\nFinancial management can\u0026rsquo;t be learned solely in the classroom. Can attending ten lectures on swimming theory and reading ten books on \u0026ldquo;Swimming Secrets\u0026rdquo; make you a swimmer? The first step is to get in the water. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s education system overemphasizes book learning and neglects practical experience.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the first step in learning to invest? Some suggest reading books, subscribing to financial magazines, or taking courses. My advice: after reading this book, invest a small amount in stocks or mutual funds (especially index funds) if unsure.\nMutual funds offer diversification and professional management, generally performing close to market averages, minimizing potential losses and discouraging fear.\nOutperforming mutual funds through individual stock picking is challenging. Fund managers have experience, expertise, and research teams. Consider mutual funds, especially index funds like CTBC Harmony Fund or China 100 Fund, in the initial stages. \u0026ldquo;Beating the index\u0026rdquo; is every fund manager\u0026rsquo;s dream, but most admit it\u0026rsquo;s incredibly difficult. If so, mirroring the market through index funds is a viable strategy.\nIf you have savings and don\u0026rsquo;t own property, consider buying a home as your first investment.\nWe learn more from failure than from success. Success is built upon countless failures.\nLearning from Mistakes # Successful American investors share two traits: 1) they don\u0026rsquo;t strive for perfection, and 2) they don\u0026rsquo;t dwell on failures, focusing instead on future challenges. High returns come with high risks. Failure is inevitable and part of the learning process. Most successful investors have experienced multiple failures.\nNo Success Without Failure\nAnyone claiming to have never lost money in investing is either lying or has never invested. It\u0026rsquo;s like a baseball player claiming to have never missed a swing. Even the best hitters don\u0026rsquo;t have a 100% batting average.\nA top baseball player once attributed his success to \u0026ldquo;missing more swings than others.\u0026rdquo; To achieve a high batting average, he must have swung and missed more times than others. Biographies of successful people often reveal that they\u0026rsquo;ve experienced more failures than those less successful. Failure is the mother of success, especially in investing.\nAspiring investors must withstand losses. Those who haven\u0026rsquo;t failed can\u0026rsquo;t achieve greatness; those who haven\u0026rsquo;t experienced losses can\u0026rsquo;t expect to make a fortune. Demanding a perfect track record leads to extreme conservatism and eliminates opportunities for success.\nThe biggest failure is to never fail. Avoiding mistakes eliminates chances for success. The best path to success is through failure and learning from it. Never forget your losses; they are the keys to victory. Successful investors analyze failures, learn from them, and improve their strategies.\nReflect and Restart\nMy failures have led to reflection, reassessment, and improved investment strategies. Most failures bring unexpected benefits. Treat failure as a necessary lesson, and your courage will grow.\nFailure can\u0026rsquo;t be learned secondhand. You won\u0026rsquo;t find books on \u0026ldquo;How to Lose 10 Million in Investments.\u0026rdquo; People brag about successes, not failures. Therefore, lessons from failure must come from personal experience.\nEveryone makes mistakes in investing. Even correct decisions can lead to losses. Since losses and failures are inevitable, accepting them and learning from them is crucial. Failure is not shameful or terrifying. Face it, overcome it, and success will follow.\n1. Take calculated risks for high rewards, be prepared for losses, and avoid undue self-blame.\n2. Learn from every failure, identify flawed decision-making habits, and avoid repeating them.\n3. Study valuable lessons from failures and discover opportunities for wealth creation.\n","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005972/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible - Investment Iron Law XIII","type":"posts"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law XII: Prosperity Comes From Land Ownership # Land possesses the characteristic of scarcity.\nWhy Real Estate Offers High Returns # Real estate prices have a long-term upward trend. Numerous research institutions in Taiwan have shown that the average annual return on real estate investment in Taiwan is around 22% to 25% or more, the highest among all investment tools. According to reports, real estate prices in Taipei\u0026rsquo;s Songshan and Xinyi districts have increased by as much as nine times in 10 years, translating to an average annual return of about 23%.\nThe Rise of Land Prices: There\u0026rsquo;s a Reason\nIn the long run, there are three main reasons why real estate prices rise and offer high returns:\nFirst, the supply of land is limited. Land is inherently scarce, and Taiwan, being an island, has limited land resources. With continuous development, the available land for construction is dwindling. Moreover, land cannot be imported, so the supply is decreasing rather than increasing, and this problem will become increasingly severe. Therefore, real estate prices are bound to increase year by year.\nSecond, demand continues to grow. Real estate can be generally divided into commercial and residential uses. Commercial real estate (such as shops and factories) can be considered a means of production. When a company\u0026rsquo;s profitability increases, it is willing to pay higher rent, which drives up the price of the property. As the company grows, its space requirements also increase annually.\nFor personal and family use, as the economy grows and incomes rise, the demand for living space and quality also increases. In the past, a family of seven, eight, or even more than ten people would be content to squeeze into a 70-100 square foot apartment. Now, with increased income, an average family of four needs a 130-165 square foot apartment or larger to be satisfied.\nA survey released in May 1996 showed that the homeownership rate in Taiwan was as high as 80%, but most were mixed-use properties with generally poor living quality, especially in metropolitan areas where the proportion of privately owned parking spaces was low. Despite the shrinking family size and high housing prices, the average living space per household has increased. In 1995, the average living space per household was 109 square feet, an increase of 20 square feet compared to 1990. As we move towards an information-based society, activities like working from home, online shopping, and banking from home will increase, further raising the demand for higher quality living spaces. Perhaps in 10 years, a 330 square foot apartment will no longer be sufficient.\nThird, inflation. Real estate not only satisfies the need for housing but also serves as a hedge against inflation. Inflation drives up the prices of tangible assets (like real estate) while devaluing intangible assets (like cash). The reason why real estate prices rise with inflation is simple: its costs, including land acquisition, building materials, and labor, are constantly increasing. These costs are inevitably reflected in the price of the property, and with sustained demand, real estate prices are bound to rise continuously.\nTherefore, the faster a country\u0026rsquo;s corporate profits increase (higher economic growth rate) and the faster national income rises, the faster real estate rents and prices will increase in the long run. Short-term real estate prices may not rise in tandem, but in the long term, prices will naturally reflect demand, and the average return on investment will be considerable.\nCan Real Estate Maintain High Returns in the Future?\nInvestors often question: \u0026ldquo;Real estate has indeed created many wealthy individuals in the past, but will it continue to rise in the future? The average annual return on real estate investment in the past was over 20%, mainly due to Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s rapid economic growth. Can Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s real estate maintain this high growth rate in the future?\u0026rdquo;\nTaiwan\u0026rsquo;s economy has transitioned from a period of rapid growth to a more stable growth phase. The average annual economic growth rate has decreased from around 9% over a decade ago to around 6% in recent years. Although economic growth has slowed significantly compared to the past, Taiwan still ranks among the top 10 globally in terms of economic growth. This is advantageous for real estate investment.\nMoreover, due to continuous population growth, Taiwan has a population density of 534 people per square kilometer, the second-highest in the world, making land even more valuable. The high savings rate among ordinary people and limited investment options mean that real estate and stocks are the primary investment channels for most. However, due to the volatility of stock prices, many prefer investing in real estate. The common belief is that leaving land or a house to the next generation provides a foundation for their future. Therefore, with limited supply and continuously increasing demand, real estate should still maintain a return rate of 15% to 20%. Furthermore, the government\u0026rsquo;s gradual relaxation of restrictions on foreign investment in Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s real estate market will further increase demand, leading to even better market performance.\nTaiwan has experienced multiple cycles of economic growth and recession, and real estate prices have gone through periods of rapid increases and long-term consolidation. Many investors questioned whether Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s housing prices would continue to rise. Especially during periods of domestic and cross-strait instability, many believed that Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s real estate market would collapse, leading them to sell their properties. Now, they regret their decisions. Facts have proven that as long as demand continues to grow and exceeds supply, prices will inevitably rise. This is an undeniable economic law. The cycle of \u0026ldquo;prices rise for a long time, then consolidate, then rise again\u0026rdquo; will continue to occur.\nIn conclusion, whether in the past, present, or future, real estate remains an indispensable investment tool for individuals, families, and businesses.\nThe three secrets to real estate investment:\nLocation, 2. Location, 3. Location. Lee Shau Kee\u0026rsquo;s Real Estate Investment Strategy # Hong Kong real estate tycoon Lee Shau Kee was ranked the richest Chinese in the world by Forbes magazine in 1996, with a net worth of US$12.7 billion, making him the fourth richest person globally. He ranked ahead of Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s richest man, Tsai Wan-lin, the fifth richest globally, and Li Ka-shing, the sixth richest and long-time wealthiest man in Hong Kong.\nLee Shau Kee is not well-known in Taiwan. Now 68 years old, he is the chairman of Henderson Land Development and Hong Kong and China Gas Company. His wealth primarily comes from Henderson Land, the second-largest listed company in Hong Kong in 1996, with a market capitalization of over NT$350 billion.\nAcquiring and Redeveloping Old Buildings at Low Prices\nAfter moving from Guangzhou to Hong Kong in 1948, Lee Shau Kee started in real estate sales, specializing in acquiring small plots of land, redeveloping them, and selling them using a then-novel sales method: \u0026ldquo;Stratified sales with ten-year installment payments.\u0026rdquo; This proved highly successful, making him famous. In 1976, he founded Henderson Land Development, focusing on real estate development, rebuilding old buildings, and developing small and medium-sized residential properties. By 1988, the company had expanded considerably, and Lee focused on real estate investment.\nLee Shau Kee\u0026rsquo;s unique skill lies in persuading owners of old buildings in bustling areas to sell their properties, acquiring them at low prices, demolishing them, and then rebuilding. Henderson Land\u0026rsquo;s vast land holdings also include farmland acquired from farmers in the early days and properties bought from overseas Chinese through advertisements in Chinese newspapers in the US and Canada.\nHe believes the best real estate investment strategy is to choose the right location, focusing on densely populated areas with convenient transportation. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s stratified sales or renting for personal use, such locations offer excellent returns on investment. He emphasizes that choosing an investment location requires the ability to turn one dollar into three.\nProsperity Comes From Land Ownership\nAfter years of research, the author has found that today\u0026rsquo;s wealthy individuals primarily accumulate their wealth through three avenues: inheritance, entrepreneurship, or investment. Among those who achieve wealth through investment, a vast majority do so through real estate.\nIndeed, most wealthy individuals have made their fortunes in real estate. In 1996, half of the world\u0026rsquo;s top ten richest individuals derived their wealth from land, including Hong Kong\u0026rsquo;s Lee Shau Kee, Li Ka-shing, Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s Tsai Wan-lin, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi of Japan\u0026rsquo;s Seibu Railway Group (ranked seventh globally), and Cheng Chou-ming (ranked tenth globally).\nAccording to the 1996 Forbes Rich List, 179 individuals involved in real estate controlled approximately US$257.2 billion in wealth, accounting for 64% of the total wealth on the list. This demonstrates that \u0026ldquo;prosperity comes from land ownership\u0026rdquo; is a timeless principle. This phenomenon is most pronounced in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan, where land is scarce and appreciation potential is high. Hong Kong\u0026rsquo;s top three richest individuals, Lee Shau Kee, Li Ka-shing, and Raymond Kwok of Sun Hung Kai Properties, all made their fortunes in real estate. Taiwan is no exception. Besides Tsai Wan-lin, prominent tycoons like Lin Rong-san, Lin Yu-lin, and Lin Hsieh-chen also built their empires on real estate. Most listed companies in Taiwan and Hong Kong are related to real estate. Even if their core business is not real estate, they have real estate investments. Companies like Yulon Motor, Shin Kong Life Insurance, Fubon Insurance, Chinatrust, and Yuanta Securities all derive significant income from real estate.\nTsai Wan-tsai, chairman of Fubon Group and one of Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s top ten richest individuals, primarily built his wealth through insurance, but stocks and real estate remain key investment tools. Tsai owns land in many bustling areas of Taipei, including a large plot near Nanyang Street, currently under development, and the newly opened Fubon Financial Center on Ren\u0026rsquo;ai Road, which he purchased in 1986 for over NT$1 billion. The 12,000 square foot property is now worth NT$4 billion. The 5,000 square foot Fubon Bank on Minsheng East Road, purchased in 1996 for NT$400,000 per ping (36 square feet), has now doubled in value. \u0026ldquo;Real estate makes money faster,\u0026rdquo; says Tsai Wan-tsai, who spends his free time looking for and buying land whenever he has the funds.\nThese examples demonstrate that for those seeking wealth through investment, real estate is an essential component of their portfolio, and should even be the primary focus. The success of financial management often depends on real estate ownership. Therefore, readers with sufficient funds should prioritize purchasing a home for personal use. Those with insufficient funds should consider leveraged investing to achieve homeownership and potentially higher returns. It\u0026rsquo;s worth reiterating: \u0026ldquo;Prosperity comes from land ownership.\u0026rdquo; Throughout history and across the globe, the vast majority of those who have achieved financial success have done so through real estate.\nFrom many perspectives, real estate is a better investment than stocks. While stocks can be a good investment, their prices fluctuate significantly. Listed stocks are traded centrally on exchanges with transparent pricing, leading to daily ups and downs that can be nerve-wracking for investors, especially when prices drop immediately after purchase. Holding stocks requires enduring the shock of substantial price swings, bringing joy during rises and pain during falls. Unfortunately, stock prices inevitably fluctuate.\nSome people experience pain regardless of whether prices rise or fall. During downturns, they regret their initial investment and don\u0026rsquo;t buy more at lower prices. During upturns, they regret not buying more initially. Their emotions are constantly affected by price movements. Real estate investment, on the other hand, doesn\u0026rsquo;t have these problems. Even if real estate prices fluctuate daily, it\u0026rsquo;s not readily apparent, allowing for a \u0026ldquo;buy and hold\u0026rdquo; strategy and enjoying the benefits of economic growth.\nLand near mountains or at the edge of development will inevitably appreciate in value.\nTsai Wan-lin\u0026rsquo;s Secret to Real Estate Riches # Tsai Wan-lin, Honorary Chairman of Cathay Life Insurance, is one of Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s richest individuals and among the top ten wealthiest globally, with a fortune of NT$180 billion. Despite his ordinary appearance and lack of exceptional academic credentials, how did Tsai Wan-lin build such a vast empire and create an extraordinary life? Where did his wealth come from? It\u0026rsquo;s widely known that he owns a \u0026ldquo;golden goose\u0026rdquo; company—Cathay Life Insurance—the largest listed company in Taiwan by market capitalization. With over NT$500 billion in available funds for investment in real estate, securities, and loans, Cathay Life\u0026rsquo;s assets have grown rapidly, allowing Tsai Wan-lin\u0026rsquo;s wealth to snowball.\nBuy Land, Rent, Don\u0026rsquo;t Sell\nTsai Wan-lin\u0026rsquo;s secret to wealth lies in familiar investment tools: stocks and real estate. He keeps nearly 50% of the shares of his wealth-generating companies, Cathay Life Insurance and Cathay Real Estate Development, locked away, allowing them to appreciate naturally. Stocks have become his \u0026ldquo;real estate.\u0026rdquo; How did he turn actual real estate into a gold mine?\nTsai Wan-lin consistently invested his money in real estate and adopted a \u0026ldquo;buy-to-rent\u0026rdquo; strategy. Now in his 70s and semi-retired, he continues to look for and buy land, his lifelong passion. According to his third son, Tsai Chen-yu, Chairman of First Commercial Bank: \u0026ldquo;We mostly choose corner lots because they offer larger buildable areas and are lively. We moved to Ren\u0026rsquo;ai Road Section 4 in 1961. Back then, it was all shooting ranges and military factories, and there was no Fudan Bridge. Looking from Ximending, the East District was the edge of development.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In the past in Taiwan, land near mountains or at the edge of development would inevitably appreciate. Sure enough, in recent years, development has extended beyond the mountains to Xizhi and Nangang, so the suburban land we bought has now become prime real estate. Our land acquisition strategy has remained consistent over the years, and now our focus has shifted to Xizhi and Tucheng, buying large tracts of suburban land for gradual development.\u0026rdquo;\nElaborating on Tsai Wan-lin\u0026rsquo;s philosophy of leasing rather than selling real estate, he added: \u0026ldquo;Real estate is called \u0026lsquo;immovable property\u0026rsquo; because you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t move it. If you sell in the short term, you\u0026rsquo;ll only make a 10% or 20% profit. Hold it for the long term, and after decades, it becomes many times its original value. Therefore, the highest level of real estate investment is renting, not buying and selling.\u0026rdquo; Tsai Chen-yu, who studied in Japan, cites Japanese century-old businesses as examples. He observed that the success of Mitsubishi Estate and Mitsui Fudosan lies in owning real estate and holding onto it. More than 65% of their operating income comes from rental income.\nBecause Tsai Wan-lin acquired his land at very low costs, he then had Cathay Real Estate Development develop it and lease it to Cathay Life Insurance, creating a stable stream of rental income and land appreciation. Cathay Life Insurance invests billions of dollars in buying and selling real estate annually. Since they buy much more than they sell, they now own over 180 buildings throughout Taiwan. In short, Tsai Wan-lin\u0026rsquo;s secret to wealth lies in holding onto real estate for the long term.\nReal Estate and Stock Investment Strategies Are Similar\nThe strategies mentioned above for stock investment also apply to real estate investment. From an investment perspective, \u0026ldquo;buy anything, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; is also an excellent strategy for real estate.\n\u0026ldquo;Buy anything\u0026rdquo; emphasizes that selecting investment targets isn\u0026rsquo;t as difficult as it seems. It\u0026rsquo;s not necessary to have predictive abilities or advanced analytical skills. Diversification is key. The impact of individual investments isn\u0026rsquo;t that significant, so buying anything can work. However, because real estate investments are larger, diversification is harder to achieve. Also, purchasing real estate often involves multiple considerations, limiting the applicability of this \u0026ldquo;buy anything\u0026rdquo; approach.\n\u0026ldquo;Buy anytime\u0026rdquo; means investing in real estate whenever you have money, without waiting for the perfect timing, because you can never predict the market perfectly. For most people, \u0026ldquo;buy anytime\u0026rdquo; seems unrealistic given the high cost of real estate. Being able to buy one house in a lifetime is already considered a significant achievement. Real estate isn\u0026rsquo;t like stocks, which can be bought in smaller amounts anytime. However, don\u0026rsquo;t underestimate yourself. Invest small amounts in stocks regularly, and when you\u0026rsquo;ve saved enough, consider leveraged investment. By following the investment principles in this book, buying three or four houses in a lifetime is achievable.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; is difficult to achieve with stocks, but easier with real estate because price fluctuations are less visible and less likely to influence decisions. Many \u0026ldquo;land rich\u0026rdquo; individuals became wealthy by adhering to this principle. Real estate is also known as \u0026ldquo;immovable property.\u0026rdquo; If you can adopt a mindset of \u0026ldquo;own the property, ignore the price,\u0026rdquo; buying and holding long-term will naturally yield high returns. Moreover, transaction costs for real estate are higher than for stocks, including taxes like land value increment tax, capital gains tax, and deed tax. If you use an agent, you\u0026rsquo;ll incur additional fees, making the overall transaction costs quite high.\nFor real estate investment, value investing, growth investing, and contrarian investing are even better strategies than \u0026ldquo;buy anything, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell.\u0026rdquo; Value investing involves buying when the intrinsic value of the property exceeds its price. As mentioned earlier, value is difficult to measure precisely for real estate, relying on subjective judgment, though market trends can provide guidance. For instance, if real estate prices decline significantly, the intrinsic value likely exceeds the market price, creating a good buying opportunity.\nChoosing the Right Location is Crucial\nContrarian investing in real estate means selecting locations that others are currently overlooking but have future growth potential. If these areas develop as anticipated, the initial low purchase price will generate substantial profits. Avoid buying when everyone else is rushing into the market, as prices are likely inflated. Conversely, when everyone believes prices will continue to fall and market activity is low, it might be the best time to invest.\nGrowth investing is perhaps the most important and easiest of the three strategies for real estate. The three secrets to real estate investment are location, location, location. The key is to consider the future growth potential of the location. Don\u0026rsquo;t choose the cheapest or currently best areas, but those with future development prospects.\nHow do you choose a good location? It requires some imagination. Real estate development is like a ripple effect from a stone thrown into a calm lake. Initially, development centers around the city center, but the surrounding areas become the fastest-growing and most promising investment targets. Growth investors can sell their properties in the city center at high prices and reinvest in cheaper outlying areas to enjoy significant future appreciation. In Taipei, the best investment location 20 years ago was Ximending. Now it\u0026rsquo;s the Eastern District, and future development will likely focus on suburban areas like Xizhi and Tucheng. Those looking to buy real estate should explore the outskirts, envisioning future development directions.\nBuy Now, Hold Long-Term: The Best Strategy\nReal estate is a cyclical industry with predictable price patterns. Short-term price fluctuations are inevitable, but in the long run, prices tend to rise. The characteristic pattern is a long period of rising prices followed by consolidation, then another period of rising prices. Real estate also exhibits a common market characteristic: the faster prices rise, the faster demand increases.\nHistorically, Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s real estate market cycles have lasted between three and nine years, averaging seven years. One characteristic of rising prices is a substantial increase of two to four times at the beginning of each cycle, followed by years of consolidation. Some hope to buy at the very beginning of a price increase, but no one can accurately predict the exact starting point. By the time you realize prices are rising, they\u0026rsquo;ve already increased substantially, and by the time you place an order, the price might be double or even more. Since no one can predict the start of a price increase, the smartest and best approach is to act promptly, buy property, and hold it long-term for substantial profits.\nGenerally, there are several signs of an impending price increase: rising stock prices, favorable government policies, and the central bank lowering interest rates to loosen monetary policy. Stock prices are a good predictor of economic activity. Rising stock prices increase available funds, which often fuels real estate price increases.\nReal estate is a \u0026ldquo;locomotive\u0026rdquo; industry. To stimulate an economy, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to stimulate real estate prices. When the government injects capital into the market and lowers interest rates to boost the economy, it often presents an excellent opportunity to invest in both real estate and stocks.\nThe two secrets to land investment are \u0026ldquo;wait\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;endure.\u0026rdquo; The right time to develop can often take two decades.\nCheng Chou-ming\u0026rsquo;s Real Estate Investment Strategy # Cheng Chou-ming, the richest man in the Philippines, has seen his wealth surge due to the recent boom in the Philippine real estate market. In 1996, Forbes estimated his net worth at US$7 billion, placing him among the world\u0026rsquo;s top ten richest individuals. His secret to success lies in stocks and real estate, and his investment strategy involves contrarian investing: buying the best assets at the lowest prices during times of low market confidence and holding them long-term.\nCheng Chou-ming owns land in Taiwan, the Philippines, mainland China, and Houston, Texas. His holdings include 32 plots of land in Taiwan totaling 135 acres and 362 plots in the Philippines exceeding 50,000 acres, where he is currently building skyscrapers. He also has a large-scale project on Fuga Island in the northern Philippines, a 250,000-acre island larger than Hong Kong by one-third, where he plans to build a free port with docks, an airport, and hotels.\nPatience and Endurance Yield Hundredfold Returns\nCheng Chou-ming, a keen real estate investor, bought large tracts of land in the Philippines 20 years ago for NT$0.2 per ping, which has now appreciated to over NT$600. This is his philosophy of \u0026ldquo;endurance,\u0026rdquo; patiently waiting 20 years for a two- to three-thousandfold return. Cheng Chou-ming says: \u0026ldquo;There are four types of people in real estate development: land investors, land developers, constructors, and builders.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Land investment takes longer, so land investors generally make larger profits, while the latter three, with shorter investment horizons, earn smaller margins, often just making money from developing the land. Land investment requires initial capital and a keen eye for location selection. Entering the market at the right time allows you to acquire land cheaply.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Future purchases of new land and interest payments on existing land can be covered by selling a small portion of the existing holdings. For example, selling one plot of land for the Asiaworld Group currently covers the acquisition cost of all our land. So, with patience and endurance, future returns can be hundreds or even thousands of times the initial investment.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the early 1970s, Cheng Chou-ming acquired the current site of the Grand Hyatt Taipei on Nanjing East Road for a very low price. While others were selling their properties and preparing to emigrate, Cheng Chou-ming decisively purchased this overgrown and neglected land, which became his base for future development in Taiwan.\nCheng Chou-ming excels at recognizing that the worst of times offer the best opportunities. During the cross-strait crisis, which caused a plunge in real estate and stock prices, he quietly acquired large amounts of stock. He said: \u0026ldquo;At that time, many stock prices were very low, and some offered annual dividends of over 20%, higher than bank interest rates. Such stocks are rare globally. With long-term investment, even just collecting dividends is worthwhile. As long as you choose the right stocks and invest long-term, you\u0026rsquo;re bound to make a lot of money.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Importance of Brand in Real Estate Investment\nMost people\u0026rsquo;s first real estate investment is a home for personal use, often buying pre-sale properties. There are three secrets to investing in a home: location, location, location.\nChoosing a home should prioritize the environment. The story of Mencius\u0026rsquo;s mother moving three times highlights the importance of the surrounding environment, safety, and the quality of neighbors, all of which impact quality of life and children\u0026rsquo;s development. Transportation, amenities, and other factors should also be considered. When purchasing pre-sale properties, focus on the \u0026ldquo;brand.\u0026rdquo; Such investments carry high risks, so the developer\u0026rsquo;s reputation and financial health are paramount, followed by practicality and growth potential.\nIn the past, when average incomes were lower, people bought cars that simply ran, were affordable, and looked decent. As demand increased and economic conditions improved, attention shifted to details, and brand and quality became more important. Cars require maintenance and repairs. Choosing a random repair shop can be problematic, with mechanics unfamiliar with the car model and a lack of available parts. Therefore, buyers began to consider the after-sales service offered by the car manufacturer.\nSimilarly, people used to buy homes that were simply livable, affordable, and in a reasonably acceptable environment. With economic growth and rising incomes, people are more demanding of quality of life, and the concept of \u0026ldquo;brand\u0026rdquo; has become increasingly important in real estate. According to the Consumers\u0026rsquo; Foundation in Taiwan, real estate litigation cases are rampant, and most cases end without resolution.\nMany construction companies in Taiwan are \u0026ldquo;one-project companies,\u0026rdquo; dissolving after completing a single project. Therefore, after purchasing a property, if any issues arise (such as unclear property rights, substandard building materials, or discrepancies in area), buyers often have no recourse. Furthermore, problems with the internal structure of a house may not be apparent initially, surfacing only after some time, such as water leaks, wall cracks, or plumbing issues. By then, there might be no one to hold accountable, highlighting the importance of brand reputation.\nReal estate investment is a major life decision. For a home, comfort is essential. Even if the purchase is for investment purposes, a \u0026ldquo;quality-guaranteed\u0026rdquo; property will be easier to sell and fetch a better price.\nAfter-sales service is another crucial factor in real estate investment. Many construction companies disengage after handing over the property, leaving the management committee to the homeowners. Due to a lack of authority and resources, these committees often struggle to address issues, leading to dissatisfaction among residents.\nSeveral reputable construction companies in Taiwan are now emphasizing community management and after-sales service. For instance, Taichung\u0026rsquo;s Sancai Construction, the company where the author currently works, entrusts community management to an affiliated company, integrating software and hardware services to create a safe and comfortable living environment. Sancai Construction also provides security, repairs, bill payment services, and housekeeping services.\nTherefore, future real estate investors should consider not only location and environment but also the developer\u0026rsquo;s brand, quality, and after-sales service. Choosing a reputable company with quality assurance, good after-sales service, and effective management is crucial for successful real estate investment.\nAs long as you avoid buying during periods of rapidly rising prices, the risk of leveraged investment is relatively low.\nLeveraged Investment in Real Estate # The substantial investment required for real estate often deters potential investors. The fact that property prices often rise faster than wages further contributes to the increasing wealth gap. However, real estate investment is relatively low-risk as long as you avoid the frenzy of buying during periods of soaring prices. Real estate, being a tangible asset, is easy to mortgage. Coupled with its high long-term returns and less visible price volatility, it\u0026rsquo;s an ideal candidate for leveraged investment.\nThe Benefit of Spreading Out Payments\nHome mortgages typically span 20 years, effectively spreading out the total cost of the property plus interest over two decades. For instance, purchasing a NT$5 million house with a 70% mortgage at a 9% interest rate over 20 years results in a monthly payment of NT$31,490.\nTherefore, if you have NT$1.5 million in savings and can afford the monthly payments, you should consider buying a property. The government often provides preferential interest rates for first-time homebuyers to promote homeownership. Those without a house should take advantage of these programs.\nSome argue that renting is more cost-effective than buying in Taiwan. A NT$5 million house might rent for only NT$20,000 per month, while buying requires a NT$1.5 million down payment and monthly mortgage payments exceeding NT$30,000. This argument usually arises during market downturns or periods of stagnation. However, it\u0026rsquo;s flawed because it ignores the long-term upward trend of real estate prices. Renting would indeed be better if prices remained constant, but they don\u0026rsquo;t. Given long-term price appreciation, buying is more cost-effective than renting, especially because leveraging magnifies returns, making real estate a high-yield investment. Many have become wealthy through real estate ownership. In short, if you can afford to buy, it\u0026rsquo;s better than renting, offering greater security and an excellent investment opportunity.\nMortgage Pressure is Manageable\nSome are reluctant to take on a mortgage due to the perceived burden of monthly payments. Twenty years ago, NT$1 million could buy a 50+ ping luxury apartment in Taipei. A 70% mortgage at a 9% interest rate translated to monthly payments of over NT$4,000. Back then, a university graduate\u0026rsquo;s starting salary was around NT$8,000 to NT$10,000, making NT$4,000 a significant burden. However, 20 years later, with inflation, experience, and increased earning power, the average monthly salary should be above NT$50,000, making the same mortgage payment much less burdensome.\nTherefore, young people investing in real estate with leverage shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be overly concerned about the initial mortgage pressure. While NT$30,000+ per month might seem daunting, future income growth will gradually ease the burden within five to ten years.\nA manager at an American bank said: \u0026ldquo;The biggest problem with mortgages in the US is people defaulting on their loans. In Taiwan, the biggest problem is people paying off their mortgages early.\u0026rdquo;\nModerate mortgage pressure can be beneficial for financial management, promoting forced savings and reduced spending. As mentioned earlier, starting early with diligent saving and investing in high-yield assets like stocks and real estate lays a solid foundation for future financial success.\nTherefore, young people with sufficient down payment and the ability to manage monthly payments should consider leveraged investment in a home. As long as borrowing is within reasonable limits, avoiding foreclosure, long-term leveraged investment in real estate is undoubtedly advantageous.\n","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005971/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law XII","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/real-estate-investment/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Real Estate Investment","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/real-estate-wealth/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Real Estate Wealth","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/success/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Success","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E4%B8%BE%E5%80%BA%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"举债投资","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%9C%B0%E6%AE%B5%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"地段选择","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%A4%B1%E8%B4%A5/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"失败","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%88%BF%E5%9C%B0%E4%BA%A7%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"房地产投资","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%88%BF%E5%9C%B0%E4%BA%A7%E8%87%B4%E5%AF%8C/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"房地产致富","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E7%BB%8F%E9%AA%8C/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"经验","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E8%A1%8C%E5%8A%A8%E5%8A%9B/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"行动力","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E8%B4%A2%E5%8A%A1%E6%9D%A0%E6%9D%86/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"财务杠杆","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E9%80%9A%E8%B4%A7%E8%86%A8%E8%83%80/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"通货膨胀","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E9%95%BF%E6%9C%9F%E6%8C%81%E6%9C%89/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"长期持有","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"13 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/contrarian-investing/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Contrarian Investing","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"13 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/growth-investing/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Growth Investing","type":"tags"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law X: Mastering the Tools of Stock Market Offense and Defense # Buy when Value is higher than Price. Sell when Value is lower than Price.\nValue Investing # The strategy of \u0026ldquo;buy any stock, buy at any time, and don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; sounds simple, but most people can\u0026rsquo;t follow it. Even if they acknowledge its potential for wealth creation, they lack the courage to implement it because it seems to contradict common investment beliefs and principles. Therefore, the author presents three superior investment strategies: value investing, growth investing, and contrarian investing. Before investing, using these strategies, you must ask yourself: Does the investment target hold this value? What is its future growth potential? Is everyone investing in it? These three investment strategies can help you make better decisions.\nVerifying Value Ensures Profitability\nDuring the 1920s, Florida\u0026rsquo;s real estate prices skyrocketed daily, triggering a buying frenzy. One fortunate investor managed to secure a plot of land. Most buyers didn\u0026rsquo;t care about the land\u0026rsquo;s quality, but this investor prudently asked a real estate agent to show him the purchased land. He was shocked to discover it was swampland. \u0026ldquo;Can anyone live here?\u0026rdquo; he exclaimed. The agent calmly replied, \u0026ldquo;Why worry about that? As long as the price goes up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Human behavior and decision-making are perfectly rational\u0026rdquo; is a fundamental assumption in academic research and theoretical development. Generally, consumers won\u0026rsquo;t rush to buy unless a product offers exceptional value. For instance, no one would pay $5 million for a car worth $500,000 unless they were foolish. Investment decisions, involving money and future wealth, are even more critical than buying a car. Logically, people should be more rational and cautious, making decisions only after careful calculations.\nHowever, are investors truly rational? In July 1985, China Development Corporation\u0026rsquo;s stock price was NT$14 per share. Four years later, in September 1989, it reached NT$1075, a nearly 80-fold increase. Remarkably, in 1985, when the price was low, investors shunned the stock, resulting in low trading volume. Conversely, in 1989, when the price soared to over NT$1000, investors rushed in, fearing they would miss out, driving trading volume to its peak.\nAre these investment behaviors rational? Consider the difference between China Development Corporation at NT$14 in 1985, at over NT$1000 in 1989, or even at NT$50 in 1983. Essentially, the difference was minimal; it was the same company, managed by practically the same people, with similar assets. Why such a drastic price difference? The answer lies not in the company\u0026rsquo;s intrinsic changes but in investors\u0026rsquo; behavioral and decision-making biases.\nBetween 1989 and 1990, during the Taiwan stock market\u0026rsquo;s peak, investors continued pouring in. The author often asked friends and family, \u0026ldquo;Do you think the stocks you\u0026rsquo;re buying are worth the price?\u0026rdquo; Most found the question perplexing and avoided answering. Some reluctantly admitted, \u0026ldquo;Probably not.\u0026rdquo; The author would then ask, \u0026ldquo;Why buy them then?\u0026rdquo; Their confident reply: \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;ll go up!\u0026rdquo;\nSome also questioned the author\u0026rsquo;s lack of participation in this lucrative market. The response: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll wait until after 4000 points to invest.\u0026rdquo; The author believed the Taiwan stock market\u0026rsquo;s true value was below 4000 points (in 1989). Those who heard this scoffed, \u0026ldquo;Keep waiting.\u0026rdquo; As it turned out, overvalued assets cannot rise indefinitely. In August 1990, the Taiwan stock index plummeted to around 2000 points, proving the author\u0026rsquo;s point. No investment\u0026rsquo;s price can remain perpetually above or below its true value.\nBuy When Value Exceeds Price\nValue investing, introduced by Benjamin Graham in his 1933 book Security Analysis, was later championed by his students, including Warren Buffett and John Templeton. In the 1980s, value investing gained prominence in the US, becoming the strategy of choice for many successful long-term investors.\nValue investing posits that every stock has an intrinsic value. Price fluctuations arise from investor trading. Prices exceeding intrinsic value will eventually revert, and prices falling below will eventually recover.\nThe principle is simple: buy when the value is higher than the price, regardless of market fluctuations. If it\u0026rsquo;s cheap, buy it. Conversely, sell when the value is lower than the price. In short, buy low, sell high. Sell when prices significantly exceed value amidst widespread buying, minimizing holdings. Buy when prices fall drastically below value amidst widespread fear, increasing holdings.\nTypically, investors focus solely on price appreciation, neglecting value. People meticulously research cars, refrigerators, or stereos for months, comparing models, reading reviews, and seeking advice, constantly evaluating value for money. They\u0026rsquo;ll wait for a sale if the price is too high. Yet, when buying stocks, often on a whim based on a tip or hearsay, they overlook value, making hasty decisions involving sums far exceeding appliance purchases.\nInvest with an Owner\u0026rsquo;s Mindset\nWarren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy emphasizes investing with an owner\u0026rsquo;s mindset and a long-term perspective. This involves buying stocks of companies with stable earnings growth, positive prospects, high asset value, or simply when the intrinsic value exceeds the price.\nCrowds flock to department stores during sales and clearances. The steeper the discounts, the larger the crowds. Conversely, shopping is most pleasant when there are no sales, as stores are less crowded. This is because consumers are motivated by value, buying when prices are below perceived worth.\nHowever, in stock markets, the opposite occurs. Brokerage houses are deserted when stock prices are at their lowest. Conversely, they are packed when prices are soaring. Investors are motivated by rising prices. A stock falling from $100 to $50 attracts little interest, while rapid price increases fuel buying frenzy.\nThe assumption of rational economic behavior applies well to consumer choices but not to investment behavior. As illustrated, investment decisions are often driven by irrational emotions, impulses, and intuition.\nValue investing advises emulating consumer behavior: buy when stocks are \u0026ldquo;on sale,\u0026rdquo; and avoid the herd when prices are inflated.\nDeveloping the Ability to Calculate Asset and Earnings Value\nThe key to successful value investing is the ability to calculate a company\u0026rsquo;s intrinsic value, encompassing asset value and earnings value. Asset value represents the liquidation value of the company\u0026rsquo;s assets per share. Earnings value represents the present value of the company\u0026rsquo;s projected future earnings. Estimating future earnings is challenging, requiring the development of forecasting skills.\nCalculating intrinsic value is not easy. Investing in familiar companies simplifies this process. Taiwanese businesswoman Shirley Wang, CEO of FIC Global, primarily invested in FIC and related IT and semiconductor companies. Her familiarity with the industry allowed her to better grasp its dynamics.\nMany successful investors adhere to Buffett\u0026rsquo;s philosophy, investing only in familiar companies. Li-Ching Hsu, former Taiwan head of ING Group, frequently advised investors to focus on companies in their own industry or related sectors.\nInvestment decisions should always involve value analysis. Buy when the value is present or the price is attractive; sell otherwise. Value investing encourages adopting consumer-like behavior in the stock market, buying low and selling high.\n1. When investing in stocks, ask \u0026ldquo;Is it worth buying?\u0026rdquo; not just \u0026ldquo;Will it go up?\u0026rdquo;\n2. Learn from consumer behavior: buy when prices are discounted.\nChoose a great company, and if it keeps growing, you\u0026rsquo;ll almost never have to sell.\nGrowth Investing # Valuing a company is challenging. Some professional investors therefore focus on earnings growth rate, a primary driver of value, as their investment criterion. Growth investing has been successfully employed by renowned investors, notably Peter Lynch, former manager of Fidelity\u0026rsquo;s Magellan Fund, who achieved the highest 15-year return among hundreds of US mutual funds.\nInvesting in High-Growth Potential Stocks\nSimply put, growth investing involves buying stocks of companies with high future growth potential and selling when that potential diminishes. A key characteristic is maintaining full investment, ideally diversified. Growth investors acknowledge their inability to predict short-term market movements but believe in the long-term upward trend of stocks, especially those with high growth potential.\nThey invest all their capital in high-growth stocks. Peter Lynch maintained a nearly 100% invested portfolio during his tenure at Magellan Fund, keeping minimal cash reserves for redemptions.\nThe key to successful growth investing lies in identifying companies with high growth potential. This is the challenge: finding high-growth stocks. Investing in IBM 30 years ago, Microsoft 15 years ago, or Cathay Life Insurance in Taiwan would have yielded multifold returns.\nHowever, countless seemingly high-growth companies fizzle out. No one can predict the future with certainty. Even Peter Lynch admitted that only half of his stock picks were truly successful, but that was enough. Therefore, diversification is crucial for mitigating the higher risks of growth investing.\nGrowth investing believes that a company\u0026rsquo;s real growth drives stock price appreciation. Investment returns depend on the earnings over the next few years. For high returns, choose investments with 5-10 year growth potential. Invest in companies in high-growth industries with excellent performance and a sustainable growth outlook. Their stock prices are likely to rise with the company\u0026rsquo;s growth, offering substantial long-term gains.\nChoosing the Right Industry is More Important Than Choosing the Right Company\nGrowth investors prioritize future earnings growth potential. Industry growth is crucial for a company\u0026rsquo;s earnings. Choosing the right industry is therefore more important than choosing the right company. Consider the future 5-10 year demand for the company\u0026rsquo;s products, focusing on the industry\u0026rsquo;s growth potential. Peter Lynch advised against selling good stocks prematurely for small profits and recommended selling stocks of companies with deteriorating growth prospects, even at a loss. This approach allows gains from successful picks to offset losses from unsuccessful ones, resulting in overall profit.\nPeter Lynch advocated for a \u0026ldquo;common sense\u0026rdquo; approach to investing, illustrated in his book One Up On Wall Street. He profited from observing his wife\u0026rsquo;s preference for certain hosiery and dish soap brands, and his children\u0026rsquo;s preference for certain sneakers, leading him to invest in those companies. This approach can be explained by market efficiency theory. Retailers and observant consumers are often the first to notice a product\u0026rsquo;s popularity, before analysts. By adopting a consumer perspective and noticing trends overlooked by experts, investors can gain an edge.\nIn early 1996, after a frugal, retired court clerk passed away, her family discovered her substantial wealth. She had consistently invested small amounts in Coca-Cola stock for decades, capitalizing on its growth and share price appreciation. This illustrates the power of long-term investment in growing companies.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Just Focus on Price Fluctuations\nMany investors are unclear about their investment rationale. If you can\u0026rsquo;t explain your investment\u0026rsquo;s business and growth potential in five minutes, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t own it. Focus on monitoring the validity of your investment thesis, not daily price fluctuations.\nMany investors prefer startups or pre-IPO companies. However, established, profitable companies with growth potential are often better investments. Peter Lynch suggested capturing the middle five years of a company\u0026rsquo;s 15-year growth trajectory, rather than the initial or mature phases. If a stock has the potential to rise from $2 to $200, wait until it reaches $8 before buying. The potential gains are still substantial, and the risk is lower. Losing money in the stock market is quick, but making money takes time. Most stocks take 3-5 years to rise significantly.\nRegarding industry growth potential, in Taiwan, IT, communications, and semiconductors within the electronics industry are promising. Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology are also attractive due to increasing health consciousness. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s ten emerging industries (specialty chemicals, environmental protection, aerospace, telecommunications, semiconductors, IT, pharmaceuticals, precision machinery, etc.) offer future growth opportunities. In the service sector, securities and investment trust, construction, and shipping also have good prospects. Savvy investors should anticipate future trends, popular products, internet-driven products, and leverage their own consumer insights to identify investment opportunities.\nGrowth investing is suitable for non-professional investors. It requires no specialized training or constant monitoring. To identify growth stocks, consider a company\u0026rsquo;s potential performance over the next 5-10 years. Invest in companies with strong growth potential and hold them long-term, selling only when they transition from growth to maturity. This strategy allows even amateur investors with limited time and expertise to achieve good results.\n1. Real earnings growth drives stock price appreciation.\n2. Diversify investments in companies with sustainable 5-10 year growth potential, patiently awaiting substantial returns.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t follow the crowd; be rational. Figure out what most people are doing, then don\u0026rsquo;t do it.\nContrarian Investing # Many ask, \u0026ldquo;Is there a better time to buy than \u0026lsquo;any time\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo; Research suggests there is: contrarian investing, a time-tested and remarkably effective strategy.\nBuy Straw Hats in Winter, Boats in a Drought\nA 19th-century American tycoon, when asked about his wealth-building secret, replied, \u0026ldquo;Buy straw hats in winter.\u0026rdquo; Similarly, Fan Li, a wealthy merchant in ancient China, followed the principle of \u0026ldquo;buying fur coats in summer, selling in winter; buying boats in a drought, selling when it rains.\u0026rdquo; These are examples of contrarian investing.\nThis investment concept originated in ancient China. According to Records of the Grand Historian, Ji Ran, an economist during the Warring States period, proposed the contrarian strategy of \u0026ldquo;invest in boats during drought, invest in carts during floods.\u0026rdquo; He argued that during droughts, when everyone invests in cart production, one should invest in boats. The oversupply of carts would lower prices and profits. When the rains return, boat demand would surge, raising prices and profits. Conversely, during floods, when everyone invests in boats, one should invest in carts.\nContrarian investing means investing when most people aren\u0026rsquo;t and selling when everyone is eager to buy. The concept is simple: go against the crowd. However, implementing it is challenging. It requires overcoming human nature, resisting herd mentality, cultivating independent judgment, and enduring loneliness. Most investors follow the crowd, while contrarian investors look for opportunities when others are fearful. This strategy relies on the belief that widespread consensus is often wrong and that reversals can be powerful.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Be Deceived by Net Buying or Selling\nContrarian investing works because when most people are bullish, available capital is already invested, leading to overinflated prices. With everyone already in the market, poised to sell, potential supply outweighs demand. Any negative news can trigger a sharp decline.\nConversely, when most people are bearish, selling pressure is minimal as most have already sold. With potential buyers waiting on the sidelines, demand outweighs supply. Any positive news can trigger a sharp rise.\nInvestors tend to extrapolate past trends, especially when reinforced by market sentiment. During initial market declines, most see it as temporary, while a few predict further declines. As the market continues falling, bears are rewarded, and bulls suffer. At severely oversold levels, widespread pessimism creates buying opportunities. Conversely, during initial market rallies, most see it as temporary, while a few predict further gains. As the market continues rising, bulls are rewarded, and bears suffer. At severely overbought levels, widespread optimism leads to overvaluation.\nBullish When Rising, Bearish When Falling\nPeople tend to become more optimistic during optimistic periods and more pessimistic during pessimistic periods. They rely on memory to predict the future. A rising market breeds bullishness, and a falling market breeds bearishness.\nAt the peak of the Taiwan stock market in late 1989, the author taught an investment course. During one lecture, a student requested the author refrain from discussing stocks. Surprised, the author asked why. The student explained that every class, from political science to calculus, included discussions about stocks.\nAnother anecdote from that period involves a professor asking his class the time. A student instinctively replied, \u0026ldquo;9865 points, up 65 points.\u0026rdquo; Students were constantly monitoring stock prices during lectures. This illustrates the pervasive stock market mania at the time. As it turned out, this widespread obsession was a harbinger of the impending crash.\nGreat investments often involve defying conventional wisdom, selling when others are buying, and buying when others are selling. Be bearish before others when everyone is bullish, and be bullish before others when everyone is bearish. As a Wall Street adage goes, \u0026ldquo;Markets are born in despair, grow in skepticism, mature in optimism, and die in euphoria.\u0026rdquo;\nContrarian investing doesn\u0026rsquo;t require constantly opposing the majority. It encourages resisting herd mentality and cultivating independent thinking. The best buying opportunities may arise when most are afraid to buy, but buying solely for that reason is as foolish as following the crowd. The crowd isn\u0026rsquo;t always wrong. Develop independent judgment. True contrarians don\u0026rsquo;t blindly oppose the majority but wait for the dust to settle and buy when no one is paying attention.\nContrarian investing applies to stock selection. David Dreman, in his book Contrarian Investment Strategies, argued that unpopular companies often outperform expectations, while popular companies are susceptible to minor setbacks.\nTiming the market is difficult. Mastering the principles of contrarian investing can be highly rewarding.\n1. Invest when others aren\u0026rsquo;t; sell when everyone is eager to invest.\n2. Don\u0026rsquo;t follow the crowd; buy when investor sentiment has cooled and no one is paying attention.\nValue, Growth, and Contrarian Strategies are Best Suited for Experts\nThese seemingly disparate strategies are not mutually exclusive. Investors can choose or combine strategies based on their individual characteristics. The most effective strategy is subjective and depends on individual circumstances. The author recommends value investing for those skilled in financial analysis, growth investing for those with foresight, and contrarian investing for independent, emotionally disciplined individuals.\nValue investing is considered the most sophisticated technique, requiring strong financial knowledge and valuation skills. Most investors lack this expertise. Even among analysts, few truly understand valuation. Growth investing requires foresight to identify high-growth industries and companies, which is also challenging. Contrarian investing requires no specialized knowledge but is the hardest to implement due to its counterintuitive nature. Most people are trend followers. Few can buy when everyone is selling or sell when everyone is buying.\nThese three strategies can enhance returns if mastered and applied correctly. Countless self-proclaimed \u0026ldquo;investment experts\u0026rdquo; populate the market, but few consistently outperform using these strategies. Misapplied, these strategies can lead to short-term speculation and losses. Therefore, the author still recommends the simple, yet effective, long-term buy-and-hold strategy of \u0026ldquo;buy any stock, buy at any time, and don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; for most investors.\n","date":"13 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005969/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law X","type":"posts"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law XI: Avoid Short-Term Trading # The greatest enemy of investment activity is human weakness: greed, fear, and herd mentality.\nThe Pitfalls of Buying Low and Selling High # Stock prices fluctuate in the short term, leading many investors to intuitively believe that profits can be made by simply \u0026ldquo;buying low and selling high.\u0026rdquo; Undeniably, the allure of price differences is strong. A limit-up day can bring thousands of dollars in profit, and buying ten lots could cover a month\u0026rsquo;s salary. However, once captivated by this temptation and engaging in the game of short-term trading, you unknowingly enter a losing battle. While luck might bring short-term gains, long-term losses are inevitable.\nStock Profits Are More Than Just Price Differences\nMany stock investors hold the misconception that profits come solely from price fluctuations. In reality, the primary source of profit lies in sharing the company\u0026rsquo;s earnings, not capitalizing on short-term price swings. Stock investments generate returns because the invested companies\u0026rsquo; earnings are ultimately distributed to investors. The immense time and effort spent researching entry and exit points, diligently watching the market, and constantly chasing trends contribute nothing to the company\u0026rsquo;s earnings.\nThe Taiwan Weighted Stock Index rose from 100 points in early 1967 to 6200 points at the end of August 1996, a 62-fold increase. Using the end of 1986 as a base period, when the index was around 700 points, the rise to 6200 points by the end of August 1996 represents an increase of over 8 times. The Taiwan stock market\u0026rsquo;s astonishing growth and substantial returns should have made every investor wealthy. However, the reality is quite the opposite. Few Taiwanese investors have profited from stocks, while countless have suffered losses. According to a 1988 survey by Professor Lin Quanyuan, 27% of investors experienced losses, and 78% earned returns below the market average. Private surveys suggest even higher loss rates. The question arises: \u0026ldquo;Where did the substantial stock market profits go?\u0026rdquo;\nShort-Term Trading is Gambling\nShort-term stock trading is speculation and gambling, both characterized by a high probability of loss. We often see short-term traders boastful after successful speculations but disappear or remain silent after losses. This creates the false impression that short-term trading is profitable. In truth, these traders usually end up losing money.\nLong-term stock holding yields an average annual return of over 15%, but only if the stocks are held and not sold. The biggest problem with short-term trading is the transaction costs incurred with each trade. Investors often overlook these costs, believing they are insignificant compared to potential price differences. In the Taiwanese securities market, the transaction cost for each round trip (buy and sell) is approximately 0.6% of the transaction amount. While a single transaction cost seems small, the cumulative effect is substantial. Imagine trading more than 25 times a year, or every two weeks. The 15% annual return would be almost entirely eroded, making it worse than keeping the money in a bank. Moreover, short-term traders often exceed 25 trades per year. Factor in a few losses, and the return becomes negative. Frequent trading inevitably diminishes returns, and negative returns are no different from gambling.\nTherefore, if you cannot resist the urge to chase short-term price differences, it\u0026rsquo;s best to avoid stock investment altogether and keep your money in the bank. While you may not become rich, it\u0026rsquo;s better than losing it all in the stock market.\nIn 1989, the total after-tax earnings of all listed companies in Taiwan were 110.3 billion NTD. In the same year, securities transaction taxes were 152.4 billion NTD, and transaction fees totaled 76.2 billion NTD. This means the combined earnings of listed companies were insufficient to cover these costs, leaving investors with an additional 118.3 billion NTD in transaction costs. It\u0026rsquo;s no wonder most stock investors suffer losses. The solution is simple: adopt a long-term holding strategy and minimize unnecessary trading. Long-term stock market investment offers high returns and lower risk. By holding long term, there\u0026rsquo;s no need for worry or fear, and wealth can be accumulated over one or two decades.\nShort-Term Trading Creates Wealth for Intermediaries\nTo achieve investment success, one must overcome \u0026ldquo;greed during market upswings and fear during downswings.\u0026rdquo;\nA book from the 1940s in the US, titled Where Are the Customer\u0026rsquo;s Yachts?, tells the story of a stockbroker taking a major client to a marina. Pointing at the luxurious yachts, the broker says, \u0026ldquo;These yachts belong to our firm\u0026rsquo;s brokers.\u0026rdquo; The client then asks, \u0026ldquo;Are any of them owned by your clients?\u0026rdquo; The broker is speechless, as none of the yachts belonged to clients. (Note: yachts were a status symbol of wealth in American society at that time).\nIt seems unlikely that valuable clients of brokerage firms would be wealthy. This story illustrates that while stock market profits are substantial, most are earned by intermediaries. Those who frequently trade and generate significant profits for brokerage firms rarely become yacht owners themselves.\nMerrill Lynch annually has a dozen or so brokers earning over a million dollars. However, their truly valuable clients are not exceptionally wealthy individuals. Wealthy people are usually busy making money and don\u0026rsquo;t have the time for frequent trading. They wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be considered valuable clients. Only those who constantly engage in short-term trading are the major contributors to transaction fees and the most loyal customers of brokerage firms.\nIn 1990, a scholar wrote a bestselling book on securities investment, earning about 1 million NTD. He was overjoyed, as it was a considerable sum for a writer. However, his friend at a brokerage firm mocked him, saying, \u0026ldquo;Your three years of hard work only earned you the equivalent of one month\u0026rsquo;s salary for a broker in our company.\u0026rdquo;\nRetail investors, your name is weakness.\nA Losing Game # The stock market comprises four main participants: intermediaries, major shareholders, large investors, and retail investors. Intermediaries include brokerage firms, the government, and information providers like newspapers, magazines, financial channels, and software companies. Regardless of market outcomes, intermediaries always profit, and their profits increase with trading volume and frequency. Major shareholders are company management or those with significant equity stakes. They have ample capital, resources, and information, giving them a winning edge. Large investors have more capital than retail investors, affording them a higher probability of success.\nIntermediaries and Large Investors Are the Winners\nThe original purpose of financial markets was to channel funds from the public to businesses, which then invest and share profits with investors. However, based on the analysis above, listed companies\u0026rsquo; earnings are insufficient to cover the costs of intermediaries, let alone distribute profits to retail investors. For retail investors to profit, they must outperform the other three players. In short-term trading, retail investors face intermediaries who always win, major shareholders who are guaranteed to win, and large investors with a higher probability of winning. In this game, retail investors have no chance.\nMost short-term trading failures are attributed to lack of skill or bad luck. In reality, a calm analysis reveals a guaranteed losing game.\nHow to Win Without Fighting\nAs a retail investor, how can you navigate this game against major shareholders, intermediaries, and large investors? The simplest solution: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t play!\u0026rdquo;\nListed companies, on average, generate profits annually, and successful companies grow increasingly profitable. Therefore, not investing idle funds means missing out on long-term gains. The \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t play\u0026rdquo; strategy doesn\u0026rsquo;t advocate avoiding the stock market altogether. Instead, it encourages investing and then leaving it alone, minimizing short-term trading.\nBy consistently investing available funds and holding long-term, investors can benefit from both company earnings and overall economic growth. This long-term holding strategy, avoiding the trading game played by intermediaries and large investors, can dramatically shift the investment landscape. If investors buy and hold, intermediaries and major shareholders lose their advantage. Even with substantial capital and insider information, their attempts to manipulate prices won\u0026rsquo;t lure disciplined retail investors into their traps, eliminating the disadvantage faced by smaller investors. Major shareholders, large investors, and retail investors would then stand on equal footing, sharing the benefits of long-term market growth.\nThis \u0026ldquo;immovable mountain\u0026rdquo; strategy transforms retail investors\u0026rsquo; disadvantage into an advantage, shifting the disadvantage to the other players, particularly intermediaries. If investors stop trading frequently, brokerage firms lose transaction fees, the government loses taxes, and financial information providers lose business. With no one to \u0026ldquo;feed\u0026rdquo; them, they might be forced to become buy-and-hold investors themselves.\nThe correct investment philosophy is to profit together, not to defeat others. The truly intelligent strategy is to avoid the competition. As Sun Tzu\u0026rsquo;s Art of War states, \u0026ldquo;The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.\u0026rdquo; The primary consideration in investment strategy should not be defeating others but maximizing profits.\nHow can everyone win? If every investor adopts the strategy presented in this book—\u0026ldquo;buy any stock, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo;—and adheres to this simple principle, a win-win situation for all can be achieved.\nFutures markets make casinos pale in comparison.\nAvoid Futures and Margin Trading # In 1995, a single trader\u0026rsquo;s mismanagement of futures trading resulted in a $1.1 billion loss, causing the collapse of Barings Bank, one of Britain\u0026rsquo;s oldest banks. This is not an isolated incident. With the rise of derivative financial products like futures and margin trading (forex, bond margin trading, etc.), such incidents of company collapses or personal bankruptcies due to mismanagement have become increasingly common. Several high-performing listed companies in Taiwan have also faced near-bankruptcy due to losses in futures or margin trading.\nEither Big Wins or Big Losses\nWhat makes futures and margin trading so dangerous? The core issue is the margin trading system itself, which has a high degree of leverage, leading to either significant gains or devastating losses in the short term. The high risk also encourages frequent trading, often multiple times a day. These transaction costs, relative to the margin, are extremely high. The combined effect of frequent trading and high transaction costs pushes the returns from futures and margin trading into significant negative territory.\nA saying circulates in the US securities market: \u0026ldquo;Futures markets make casinos pale in comparison.\u0026rdquo; In other words, futures markets are even more of a gamble than casinos. After paying substantial transaction costs to intermediaries, what profits are left for investors? The author has extensively studied investment history across various countries and has personally participated in the securities market for over a decade. I have never heard of any investor consistently profiting from long-term participation in futures or margin trading. On the contrary, almost everyone I know involved in such activities has ultimately lost money.\nThe purpose of futures and margin trading markets is to provide hedging tools for businesses. Individual investors rarely have such hedging needs. For them, these markets become \u0026ldquo;even more of a gamble than casinos\u0026rdquo; due to the temptation of short-term trading. The author strongly advises readers to avoid futures and margin trading entirely. If reading this book leads you to stay away from these activities, then the book\u0026rsquo;s price has already been repaid, and the author\u0026rsquo;s efforts have been worthwhile.\nOften a Waste of Effort\nThe biggest obstacle to successful financial management is not the difficulty of understanding but the difficulty of implementing what is understood. The principles discussed above are easy to grasp, but understanding doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee implementation. In the volatile investment world, faced with fluctuating prices, investors are often tempted by greed to chase short-term gains or driven by fear to react to price swings. They unknowingly fall into the trap of short-term trading. While the process can be thrilling, it often ends in wasted effort. The true beneficiaries of this game are usually the brokerage firms and the major shareholders manipulating the stocks, leaving retail investors with losses.\nMany people invest in stocks not to build wealth but to prove their intelligence, knowledge, and predictive abilities to others. They constantly analyze and research, overemphasizing market trends and predictions. This leads to impatience, chasing rising prices and selling during dips, attempting to profit from short-term fluctuations. However, this constant buying and selling consumes time, energy, and money in the form of hefty transaction costs, while also creating opportunities for major shareholders and large investors to manipulate stocks. The ultimate result is often a waste of time and money. While knowledge and experience might increase, wealth does not.\nTo succeed in the fast-paced and lucrative investment world, you must cultivate self-discipline. The secret to investment success lies not in knowledge or skill, nor in intelligence or luck, but in self-control. Your investment acumen allows your assets to generate returns, and your patience in long-term holding allows the power of compounding to take you to new levels of wealth. Before succumbing to the temptation of short-term trading, ask yourself: \u0026ldquo;Which wealthy person achieved their fortune through continuous short-term trading?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Which successful stock market investor didn\u0026rsquo;t rely on long-term holding?\u0026rdquo;\nTemporary Glory Leads to Crushing Debt\nIn the history of the Taiwan stock market, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to find examples of individuals who built wealth through short-term trading. There are many who gained fame through short-term speculation, like Lei Bolong, but they often ended up heavily in debt and even faced imprisonment. This is not unique to Taiwan; the same holds true for the US stock market. The author has studied renowned American investors and has never found a prominent figure whose strategy primarily involved short-term trading. Long-term wealth accumulation through short-term trading is virtually unheard of.\nStock investment is a vital path to personal wealth creation and a crucial source of long-term capital for businesses. However, using the wrong approach can lead to financial ruin instead of prosperity. Listed companies issue stocks to raise capital, and if these funds are then misused in speculative games, it can be detrimental to individuals, society, and the nation.\nStockholders are company owners with the inherent rights to profit sharing and residual asset distribution. Therefore, the company\u0026rsquo;s profits will eventually be distributed to shareholders as dividends. With patience, the wealth generated by the company ultimately belongs to the investors.\nTherefore, I urge all readers to avoid the game of short-term trading. Throughout history, no renowned investor has achieved wealth through short-term speculation.

This leads investors to frantically chase the \u0026ldquo;buy low, sell high\u0026rdquo; principle. Let\u0026rsquo;s discuss whether forecasting and analysis are truly effective. Can they genuinely help investors make a fortune?\nIs Technical Analysis Effective?\nIn April 1993, the Taiwan Economic Daily published an article titled, \u0026ldquo;Success in Stocks Depends on Entry and Exit Timing.\u0026rdquo; This led many to believe that the most crucial task in investment analysis is determining the right moments to buy and sell.\nThe average investor believes the golden rule for wealth in the stock market is \u0026ldquo;buy low, sell high.\u0026rdquo; They also believe the key to success lies in accurately grasping these timing opportunities. Consequently, countless investors try every means to predict future stock price trends to determine optimal buying and selling points. In their quest for the Midas touch, various methods, from the scientific to the absurd, and even the supernatural, such as astrology and market horoscopes, have emerged. Currently, the most widely used method is \u0026ldquo;technical analysis.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the author\u0026rsquo;s humble opinion, technical analysis\u0026rsquo;s popularity in the global investment market, and its continued prevalence among Taiwanese investors, stems from the fact that it appears sophisticated yet not overwhelmingly complex, thus attracting many novice investors. These beginners often believe they must possess some secret technique to navigate the stock market, leading them to prioritize learning technical analysis upon entering the market.\nTechnical analysis originated from the Dow Theory in the 1930s, after which various technical analysis methods sprung up like mushrooms. From the 1940s to the 1960s, technical analysis was highly popular in the US stock market. However, with the advent of the Random Walk Theory, and the observation that most users of technical analysis ended up worse off, its popularity began to wane. By the 1980s, when the author was studying investment analysis in the US stock market, established investment analysts rarely mentioned technical analysis. At the time, if an investor claimed to use technical analysis for investment decisions, it implied inexperience and a high probability of losing money.\nTechnical analysis involves studying and analyzing past price trends and volume data to determine buying and selling timings. Its fundamental assumption is that history repeats itself. Therefore, by identifying the patterns of stock price movements, one can accurately predict future trends.\nBeating the Market is a Pipe Dream\nNumerous empirical studies by scholars have revealed many problems and controversies surrounding technical analysis. Briefly summarized:\nHistorical patterns don\u0026rsquo;t always repeat. Even if technical analysis has been effective for decades, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee future success. If a particular technical analysis method consistently succeeds, its widespread adoption will eliminate its potential profits. The collective actions of technical analysts can create price patterns. This means the price isn\u0026rsquo;t reflecting a correct prediction but rather the analysts\u0026rsquo; actions. Some technical indicators rely on comparisons with past data. These values can change due to time and environment, making past standards inapplicable to the present. If you were given a past stock chart and asked to devise a profitable investment strategy, everyone would understand \u0026ldquo;buy low, sell high.\u0026rdquo; Profiting from trading in such a scenario would be easy. However, investing is about the future. Future price movements are complex and unpredictable; no one possesses a future stock chart. So, is \u0026ldquo;buy low, sell high\u0026rdquo; still a suitable investment strategy? The answer is no. The reason is simple: no one can predict market highs and lows in advance.\nUsing previously successful technical analysis methods doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee future success in beating the market, as excess returns can be random. Furthermore, concluding that technical analysis is effective based on occasional or random excess returns is misleading. While technical analysis might yield short-term gains, it cannot consistently outperform the market in the long run.\nA student once asked me, if the market follows a random walk and technical analysis is ineffective, why are some technical analysis methods accurate at times? Claiming technical analysis is ineffective means it can\u0026rsquo;t generate long-term excess profits, not that its predictions are always wrong. Technical analysis can sometimes be accurate, just like random guesses can be accurate. Therefore, technical analysis isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily inaccurate; its accuracy is comparable to guessing.\nThe Trap of Short-Term Trading\nAnother significant drawback of technical analysis is that its methods focus on identifying buy and sell points. These points constantly emerge, forcing investors to frequently buy and sell, trapping them in short-term trading and eroding returns through transaction costs. The ineffectiveness of technical analysis means that, on average, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t generate excess returns over the long term. In other words, while sometimes accurate, it ultimately underperforms the market\u0026rsquo;s average return (buy-and-hold strategy).\nYou might have used technical analysis methods with seemingly good results. I admit some methods can be effective, but investors often overlook transaction costs. Considering these costs, returns from technical analysis are unlikely to be high. Furthermore, the effectiveness of any technical analysis method is inconsistent, making long-term high returns improbable.\nTechnical analysis exhausts investors, leading to significant losses. Investors should abandon it and adopt a long-term \u0026ldquo;buy-and-hold\u0026rdquo; strategy to benefit from long-term market growth. It\u0026rsquo;s crucial to understand that market risk is inherent in any investment strategy. Investors should be mentally prepared and avoid excessive optimism about short-term returns. Profitable investing relies on correctly judging the overall market direction. Obsessively seeking investment rules from past data, even if profitable, will likely incur time and effort costs exceeding the returns.\nIf you still believe technical analysis can lead to riches, ask yourself: who has become wealthy solely through technical analysis?\nBlind faith in predictions is worse than no prediction at all. Prediction is more art than science.\nThe Only Certainty is Uncertainty # The biggest mistake in investment strategies is overconfidence in prediction. If you\u0026rsquo;ve tirelessly searched for prediction methods without success, or your developed methods are unreliable and unprofitable, don\u0026rsquo;t be discouraged. All predictions face the same challenges.\nLike you, forecasting experts cannot predict the future. If they possessed a crystal ball, they would be wealthy, not making a living from predictions. If this logic isn\u0026rsquo;t convincing, ask yourself: \u0026ldquo;Which self-made millionaire or consistently successful long-term investor has relied solely on prediction?\u0026rdquo; The answer is none.\nInvestment Performance is Unrelated to Predictive Ability\nPeople often assume investment success hinges on predictive ability. Those who predict better supposedly perform better, while investment failures are attributed to poor prediction. However, this isn\u0026rsquo;t true. Most successful investors admit their inability to predict the future. They have no preconceived notions, and their success stems from sound strategies, not accurate predictions.\nDuring my studies in the US, when I first dabbled in the US stock market, I shared the common belief that Wall Street analysts were remarkable and highly skilled at predicting market trends. After graduating from UC Berkeley in 1987, I left academia for a position at a major US brokerage firm, largely driven by the desire to learn from renowned analysts at Merrill Lynch.\nAt Merrill Lynch, I witnessed these analysts firsthand. After numerous interactions, I realized they couldn\u0026rsquo;t accurately predict future stock prices. Some didn\u0026rsquo;t even invest in stocks themselves. I often called analysts, asking which stocks to buy and when the market would rise. One analyst, perhaps tired of my persistent inquiries, frankly told me, \u0026ldquo;Think about it. If I knew which stocks would rise and when the market would go up, would I be stuck working as an analyst?\u0026rdquo; It was then I understood that analysts don\u0026rsquo;t possess predictive powers.\nUpon returning to Taiwan, I observed that local newspapers and magazines were filled with \u0026ldquo;Expert Predictions\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Analyst Market Forecasts.\u0026rdquo; I interacted with several well-known analysts, studying their predictions carefully. My conclusion: there were no superior predictions in the Taiwan stock market. These analysts and experts couldn\u0026rsquo;t accurately grasp the market\u0026rsquo;s future direction.\nAnalysts Rely on Hype\nWhy do so many analysts and experts constantly make predictions in the media? The reason is simple: supply follows demand. Readers crave these predictions, prompting newspapers and magazines to create dedicated columns. Experts often publish predictions not because they possess foresight but because readers believe experts have superior knowledge of the future and eagerly seek their opinions. Newspapers cater to this demand by soliciting expert articles. Similarly, why do brokerage firms employ so many analysts to interpret market trends for clients? To meet customer needs. In a competitive environment, analyst insights are considered a crucial service. Brokerage firms readily provide this service because research indicates that investors guided by experts tend towards short-term trading, generating higher commissions for the firms.\nThis demonstrates investors\u0026rsquo; heavy reliance on expert predictions, which arise from investor demand. The problem is that the stock market is unpredictable. No one can make accurate predictions, a widely acknowledged fact. Yet, most investors still believe in expert forecasts.\nA US poll once asked, \u0026ldquo;Who lies to the public the most?\u0026rdquo; The results: weather forecasters, stock analysts, and economic commentators. This reveals not that expert predictions are always inaccurate but the public\u0026rsquo;s unwavering faith in them, leading to heightened expectations. These professions often require making future predictions under the assumption that \u0026ldquo;experts must be able to predict; those who can\u0026rsquo;t predict aren\u0026rsquo;t experts.\u0026rdquo; This pressure compels many researchers and analysts to publish future predictions, despite the inherent uncertainty. Being wrong is inevitable, and being perceived as liars arises from the public\u0026rsquo;s initial belief in their predictions, leading to feelings of deception when they prove incorrect.\nYou might question this, citing instances of analysts who made remarkably accurate predictions, causing stocks to surge upon their recommendations. However, have you noticed that these seemingly prophetic \u0026ldquo;experts\u0026rdquo; are rarely the same person and often disappear after a while? In reality, these experts, unless backed by market manipulators who profit from deceiving retail investors, are simply experiencing probability at play. Occasional streaks of accuracy are possible but not sustainable.\nStrategies to Lure Retail Investors\nMarket manipulators aiming to pump and dump a stock, besides securing cooperation from major shareholders, must create a forecasting \u0026ldquo;expert\u0026rdquo; who, through media appearances, convinces retail investors to buy in. As major shareholders lock up their shares and more investors join, it creates the illusion that the \u0026ldquo;expert\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; predictions are coming true, causing the stock price to surge.\nJoseph Granville was a popular technical analyst in the early 1980s. His remarkably accurate market predictions in the late 1970s made him famous. His large following gave him considerable market influence; his words could move the market by tens of points. However, in early 1982, he predicted a major market crash, advising his followers to sell all their stocks. Instead, the market surged from around 700 to over 1200 points within five months. Those who heeded his advice missed a significant bull market, and Granville faded into obscurity.\nI advise investors to avoid stocks being manipulated. Even if you make small profits initially, one loss could wipe out all gains and more. Another reason: manipulated stocks involve major shareholder intervention. These shareholders, instead of focusing on business operations and profits, are interested in quick gains through market manipulation, indicating poor management. Such companies aren\u0026rsquo;t worth investing in. Their scheme relies on retail investors\u0026rsquo; money; retail investors have little chance of winning. If retail investors could profit from this game, what would be the point for the major shareholders?\nAnother possibility for accurate predictions is simply probability. Predictions are often diverse and contradictory, with some bullish, some bearish, and some expecting consolidation. Inevitably, someone will be right, purely due to luck or higher guessing probability.\nMore Wrong Guesses Than Right\nHowever, most people don\u0026rsquo;t think this way. When experts make several consecutive correct predictions, they gain credibility and are hailed as \u0026ldquo;prophets.\u0026rdquo; People easily forget past incorrect predictions, treating the \u0026ldquo;prophet\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; words as gospel. This is extremely dangerous. Investors overlook the possibility of future incorrect predictions.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not entirely dismissing analysts and experts. In the unpredictable investment world, many investors need expert guidance. Analyst data and forecasts can be valuable reference material. My point is, regardless of your attitude towards expert predictions, remember: the future is dynamic and unpredictable. Investment risk is an unavoidable reality and must be managed.\nIn early 1990, as the market peaked, most experts predicted continued growth. A prominent \u0026ldquo;market prophet\u0026rdquo; confidently proclaimed the market would reach 15,000 points within six months and 20,000 within a year. Major media outlets reported this prediction. The reality was starkly different. Within six months, the market plummeted 2,000 points, shocking all experts. Did these experts disappear? No. Newspapers and magazines still feature expert market forecasts. The reason is simple: investors are \u0026ldquo;used to\u0026rdquo; hearing these predictions and many remain captivated by them.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t advocate completely ignoring predictions. Predictions have value, and good predictions are worth considering. However, whether you believe in predictions or not, and regardless of the predictor\u0026rsquo;s reputation, remember: the future is fluid and unpredictable. Investment risk is an inherent part of investing and must be managed.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need predictive abilities to invest well or make money in the market. In this complex and volatile market, the only certainty is uncertainty. In the investment world, profits come from choosing the right investments and holding them long-term, not from predicting market movements. In summary, consider expert predictions, but remember they are just predictions. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly trust them.\nThere are no experts in the stock market, only winners and losers.\nTrust Yourself, Not the Experts # Some believe that lacking professional expertise makes achieving wealth through investment incredibly difficult. Yet, many who don\u0026rsquo;t understand stocks or real estate still achieve financial success through investing. Most successful investors aren\u0026rsquo;t investment professionals, and investment professionals aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily successful investors. This shows that expertise isn\u0026rsquo;t a prerequisite for wealth creation through investment.\nInvestment and financial management aren\u0026rsquo;t inherently complex. The perceived complexity and reliance on experts stem from investors\u0026rsquo; inability to cope with uncertainty, overcomplicating simple matters and turning financial management into a source of anxiety and confusion. This anxiety hinders rational decision-making, leading people to constantly seek external opinions.\n10 Experts, 11 Opinions\nThe inability to handle uncertainty creates the illusion that foresight or profound analytical skills are necessary for successful investing, leading to the belief that only \u0026ldquo;experts\u0026rdquo; can manage finances effectively. Consequently, many entrust their financial decisions to experts, who often offer conflicting \u0026ldquo;expert opinions.\u0026rdquo; Ten experts can have eleven different views, further complicating the investment world and adding to investor confusion.\nBasing your financial decisions solely on expert opinions is extremely dangerous. Ultimately, investment responsibility lies with the individual. Investors should enhance their financial literacy and become their own experts. Financial management doesn\u0026rsquo;t require extensive professional knowledge. By following a few basic principles outlined in this book and acting accordingly, you can achieve wealth without relying on experts. With the right investment philosophy, you might even outperform them.\nTherefore, I urge investors to take immediate action, start investing, and stop asking questions like \u0026ldquo;When will the market rise?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Which stock should I buy?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Should I sell my xxx stock now?\u0026rdquo; These questions are pointless; no one knows the correct answers.\nIn 1983, when I began my doctoral studies at UC Berkeley, I started helping Taiwanese entrepreneurs invest in US stocks. To excel at this, I dedicated immense effort to stock analysis, often neglecting sleep and meals. For one to two years, I practically lived in the Berkeley Haas School of Business library, devouring every investment book and analyzing all available stock information. I learned various technical, fundamental, and market analysis techniques. To develop my unique investment analysis and prediction methods, I utilized Berkeley\u0026rsquo;s advanced computers and extensive stock databases, writing programs to simulate various investment approaches. This proved futile; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a satisfactory method. It was all for naught.\nIf anyone truly knew when the market would rise or which stock to buy, they would be wealthy enough not to need a job as an analyst or expert. I reiterate: even without knowing \u0026ldquo;when the market will rise\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;which stock to buy,\u0026rdquo; you can still achieve wealth through investing. Stop wasting time on these questions. Countless people have dedicated their lives to researching them since the inception of the stock market. They became stock experts but didn\u0026rsquo;t achieve wealth through investing.\nInaction and Effortless Gains\nFinancial management doesn\u0026rsquo;t require excessive time. Those who spend less time on it often perform better.\nStatistics show that Taiwanese stock investors spend an average of 3.12 hours daily on stock analysis and market watching. Is stock picking difficult? Is making money in the stock market challenging? Constantly chasing price fluctuations, what are your returns? Those who diligently study stocks often lose the most money.\nA common investor mistake is giving up. They eagerly enter during bull markets and become disheartened during bear markets, abandoning the market entirely. Lacking patience and perseverance, they rarely succeed. Conversely, those with less financial acumen, admitting their inability to time the market, often persevere and ultimately fare better.\nThe path to investment wealth is simple: effortless gains. The investment strategy presented—\u0026ldquo;buy any stock, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo;—can be summarized as \u0026ldquo;do nothing, gain effortlessly.\u0026rdquo;\nWho wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want effortless gains? Surprisingly, most investors can\u0026rsquo;t achieve this. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no such thing as a free lunch\u0026rdquo; is a widely known principle. Applying this to investment, people assume they must master complex techniques and work harder than others to profit. Intuitively, they believe more knowledge and effort equate to higher returns. This might hold true in other areas, but in finance, the opposite is often true. Knowledge and effort don\u0026rsquo;t significantly contribute to investment returns. Knowing more and constantly monitoring the market encourages impulsive trading, leading to \u0026ldquo;effort without gain.\u0026rdquo;\nInaction is Superior to Action\nEven investment gurus like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch admit they can\u0026rsquo;t predict market movements. Admitting ignorance might seem foolish, but it\u0026rsquo;s the beginning of financial wisdom. Being \u0026ldquo;foolish\u0026rdquo; enough to \u0026ldquo;buy any stock, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; is the starting point of wealth creation. Confucius said, \u0026ldquo;Great wisdom appears foolish.\u0026rdquo; This refers to highly learned individuals who achieve mastery through natural means, without contrivance or cunning. They appear unintelligent but are truly wise. Lao Tzu also said, \u0026ldquo;Great skill appears clumsy,\u0026rdquo; and advocated for \u0026ldquo;governing by non-interference.\u0026rdquo; This strategy, applied to the volatile investment environment, is a sound approach. Unless you have strong conviction about future trends, it\u0026rsquo;s better to ignore the chaos and remain inactive.\nTherefore, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to be an investment expert or possess sophisticated techniques. \u0026ldquo;Do nothing, gain effortlessly\u0026rdquo; is the key to financial wealth. You might think this sounds too simple, even boring. Indeed, it is. But this simplicity is the path to riches and becoming a millionaire. Before acting, ask yourself: \u0026ldquo;Do I want wealth or to be a stock market expert?\u0026rdquo; If you want wealth through stocks, emulate the many who became rich by simply investing and then ignoring the market. Decades later, compounding will make you wealthy. You could also dedicate yourself to becoming a stock market expert, but this rarely leads to riches.\nMy point is, even without knowing \u0026ldquo;when the market will rise\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;which stock to buy,\u0026rdquo; you can still achieve wealth through investing. Short-term market fluctuations are unpredictable, but the long-term trend is upward. Long-term investing is the key to profit.\n\u0026ldquo;Buy any stock, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo;—so simple, effortless, and seemingly undeserved. While it feels like unearned gain, don\u0026rsquo;t feel guilty. Investing in stocks contributes to economic development. Constant trading harms individual wealth and offers no benefit to the overall economy or society.\nEasier Said Than Done\nSome worry and ask, \u0026ldquo;You advise against saving money in banks. If your book becomes a bestseller and this idea spreads, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it cause a nationwide bank run?\u0026rdquo; This is an unnecessary concern. I\u0026rsquo;ve been advocating against saving money in banks for three years, even before this book\u0026rsquo;s publication. Many who hear this idea nod in agreement, as if enlightened, yet days, months, or years later, their money remains untouched in bank accounts.\nOthers question whether my \u0026ldquo;buy any stock, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; theory, if widely adopted, would force brokerage firms to close, depriving the government of transaction taxes. Again, there\u0026rsquo;s no need for such concerns. Those who frequently engage in short-term trading in stocks, futures, or margin accounts, even after understanding that it only benefits intermediaries, often can\u0026rsquo;t resist continuing their behavior. Like gambling, everyone knows the odds are stacked against them, yet gambling persists.\nI understand that \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t save money in banks,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;avoid short-term trading,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;diversify and hold long-term,\u0026rdquo; are simple in theory but difficult in practice. Nevertheless, I sincerely hope readers can integrate knowledge and action, diversifying most of their assets into stocks and real estate, holding them long-term. Achieving financial freedom is within reach.\n","date":"12 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005968/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law Ⅸ","type":"posts"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law VIII: Profit When You Buy, Profit When You Sell # Some people do nothing all day,\nunderstand nothing about investing,\nyet become billionaires.\nBuy Randomly, Buy Anytime, Don\u0026rsquo;t Sell # You may already understand the principle of wealth creation: invest money in high-return investment vehicles and hold them for the long term. But you might still have questions: How should you invest? When should you buy? What should you buy? When should you sell?\nThe Highest Realm of Financial Management\nI propose an investment strategy here. This method is arguably the simplest, as everyone can do it; yet it is also the hardest, as few can truly follow it. This strategy is: \u0026ldquo;Buy randomly, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell.\u0026rdquo; You might ask, \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s so difficult about buying randomly, buying anytime, and not selling?\u0026rdquo; If you think it\u0026rsquo;s easy, try it yourself. If you can genuinely do it, then congratulations! You have grasped the essence of investment and financial management, reaching the highest level of investing prowess.\nThe average investor\u0026rsquo;s favorite questions are: \u0026ldquo;What to buy?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;When to buy?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;When to sell?\u0026rdquo; Imagine if someone knew the answers, they would surely keep it a secret and profit themselves. Would they tell you first? Investors often assume experts know when the market will rise or fall, and which stocks to buy. It\u0026rsquo;s as if those who don\u0026rsquo;t know these things are not worthy of being called experts or analysts. However, only true experts admit they don\u0026rsquo;t know when the market will rise or fall. Precisely because no one knows future market movements, investing is worthwhile. It\u0026rsquo;s this uncertainty that creates the potential for high returns. Otherwise, all investment profits would be taken by those with foreknowledge.\nMost people believe that to profit from investing, you must accurately predict market timing, select the right investment targets, and know when to sell. But based on my more than ten years of experience in investment, investment management, and investment research, capturing the perfect entry point is nearly impossible. Even investment gurus like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch admit they don\u0026rsquo;t know when stocks will rise or when to sell.\nYou might be puzzled by how some people, seemingly doing nothing and lacking investment knowledge, become incredibly wealthy. The three principles presented in this book – \u0026ldquo;buy randomly, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; – are the key factors to their success.\nThe Wealth Creation Method of Hou Boming, Executive Director of Tainan Spinning\nThe three Hou brothers, Boming, Boyu, and Boyi, are the largest shareholders of Tainan Spinning, possessing a fortune exceeding 15 billion. Despite being major tycoons in Southern Taiwan, they maintain a low profile. Hou Boming, in his 40s, can sometimes be found playing pinball at night markets.\nHou Boming\u0026rsquo;s grandfather, Hou Yuli, was a founding figure of Tainan Spinning. After the successive deaths of his grandfather and father, Hou Yongdu, Hou Boming, his two older brothers, and his mother inherited a quarter of Tainan Spinning\u0026rsquo;s shares. They remained passive shareholders, not participating in the company\u0026rsquo;s management, staying completely silent. Their immense wealth only came to light when Hou Yuli\u0026rsquo;s daughter, Hou Yingzu, sued her brothers, Hou Yongdu and Hou Yongsong, and her nephew, Hou Boming, for allegedly misappropriating family assets.\nThe Hou brothers\u0026rsquo; investment strategy is simple: buy stocks and hold them long-term, accumulating wealth through dividends. Some criticize them for lacking business acumen and real estate development skills, but with this simple method, they became one of the top 20 richest families in Taiwan.\nHad they heeded others\u0026rsquo; advice and sold their stocks to pursue business ventures, they might have lost their position among the top 20 wealthiest, perhaps becoming another example of \u0026ldquo;wealth not lasting three generations.\u0026rdquo; If they had deposited their money in the bank, the wealth accumulated by their grandfather 40 years ago might have dwindled to almost nothing due to inflation. With a real return rate of zero in a bank, depositing NT$500,000 annually would take 200 years to reach NT$100 million.\nTo the average person, the Hou brothers\u0026rsquo; approach may seem unremarkable. Yet, their wealth hasn\u0026rsquo;t diminished due to inflation; instead, it has grown year after year. Their grandfather was a multi-millionaire 30 years ago, but their generation has become multi-billionaires. The key lies in investing in high-return vehicles – stocks – and holding them long-term.\nBlindfolded, throw a dart,\nBuy whichever stock it hits.\nWhat to Buy - Buy Randomly # Everyone says choosing the right investment target is crucial for success, and I agree. But how to choose is a difficult and complex question. The strategy I propose is exceptionally simple, so simple that you might not be able to follow it: \u0026ldquo;Buy randomly.\u0026rdquo;\nMore Accurate than a Broker\u0026rsquo;s Eye\n\u0026ldquo;Buy randomly\u0026rdquo; is so simple! Some suggest pinning the stock market section of The Wall Street Journal to a wall and throwing darts at it, buying whichever stock the dart hits. Scholars conducted an experiment where a monkey, blindfolded, threw darts at stock listings. The resulting portfolio performed remarkably well, even outperforming portfolios managed by professional fund managers.\nWhy is \u0026ldquo;buying randomly\u0026rdquo; a good stock selection method? If you\u0026rsquo;ve studied portfolio diversification theory in finance, you\u0026rsquo;ll understand that as the number of stocks in a portfolio increases (beyond 10), the impact of individual stock factors diminishes. In other words, as long as you diversify, stock selection ability becomes less important. Random selection works. Especially with 30 or 40 different stocks, the overall performance will closely mirror the market.\nBuying randomly sounds simple, even a monkey or a fool could do it. But in reality, it\u0026rsquo;s extremely difficult, so difficult that only a fool could actually do it. I must admit, while I believe in the principle of \u0026ldquo;buying randomly,\u0026rdquo; I can\u0026rsquo;t bring myself to do it when investing my own money.\nAs mentioned earlier, to help my child reach billionaire status by their 40s, I buy them stocks worth tens of thousands of dollars annually. To practice \u0026ldquo;buying randomly,\u0026rdquo; I spread out the stock market section of the newspaper and ask my 4-year-old to pick a stock. However, each time they point to one, I move their hand, saying, \u0026ldquo;Why did you pick this one?\u0026rdquo; Then I ask them to pick another, but I\u0026rsquo;m still not satisfied. This is because I can\u0026rsquo;t bring myself to buy the stocks my child randomly selects. In the end, it\u0026rsquo;s me, the self-proclaimed \u0026ldquo;investment expert\u0026rdquo; dad, who selects a stock after careful analysis and research.\nDespite this, I record the first stock my child picks each year. It\u0026rsquo;s been five years now, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t sold any of the five stocks. Surprisingly, the performance of the five stocks I carefully selected is about the same as the five randomly picked by my child. This further validates that \u0026ldquo;random selection\u0026rdquo; is not only simple but also performs well in the long run.\nNo One Can Guarantee Gains or Losses\nThe purpose of suggesting \u0026ldquo;random selection\u0026rdquo; is not to encourage you to literally throw darts at stock listings, though it\u0026rsquo;s not a bad method. My real intention is to highlight that random selection is sufficient when choosing investments. You don\u0026rsquo;t need excessive caution or to follow expert advice that demands painstaking research. The reason is simple: as mentioned, if you had chosen Cathay Life Insurance 20 years ago and held it, you would be a billionaire today. Conversely, if you had chosen Kuosheng 10 years ago and held it, you would have lost everything. Many experts use this to justify advising investors to be extremely cautious and meticulous in stock selection. The problem is, no matter how knowledgeable or cautious you are, you can\u0026rsquo;t guarantee picking the next Cathay Life Insurance or avoiding the next Kuosheng.\nA key point to consider: You don\u0026rsquo;t need to pick the perfect stock like Cathay Life Insurance to become wealthy. As long as your investment returns are close to the overall market average, you can still become a billionaire. To achieve this, you simply need to \u0026ldquo;diversify and choose randomly.\u0026rdquo;\nAverage investors often fail to understand this, leading them to be overly cautious, spending significant time, effort, and money on analysis, research, seeking hot tips, and consulting experts. This usually leads to two outcomes:\nConfusion: Opinions on which investments are good vary widely, leading to indecision. Unable to find a \u0026ldquo;safe\u0026rdquo; investment, investors often resort to the riskiest long-term move – leaving their money in the bank. False Sense of Security: Sometimes, an investment appears excellent from all angles, with most experts endorsing it. This perceived safety often attracts cautious investors, but these \u0026ldquo;safe\u0026rdquo; investments can be the most dangerous. Remember: Investments everyone considers good are often the worst. In mid-1995, almost everyone viewed semiconductor stocks like TSMC and UMC favorably. Many cautious investors flocked to these stocks. A year later, the market was up 30% on average, while TSMC and UMC plummeted, halving in value. While simple, buying randomly is a difficult investment philosophy to embrace. But it teaches us a valuable lesson: Don\u0026rsquo;t overthink stock selection. Diversify your portfolio and choose randomly. Investing can be that simple.\nThe ratio of up days to down days in the stock market is approximately 55:45.\nWhen to Buy - Buy Anytime # Many claim that choosing the right entry point is crucial for investment success, and I agree. However, timing the market is equally difficult and complex. My proposed strategy is simple, so simple you might find it hard to follow: \u0026ldquo;Buy anytime.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Buy anytime\u0026rdquo; means investing your money whenever you have it, regardless of the day or time. In other words, don\u0026rsquo;t keep your money in the bank. Invest any surplus funds beyond your daily needs, regardless of whether you think prices will rise or fall.\nBuy and Wait for the Opportunity\nInvestors often ask, \u0026ldquo;When should I start investing?\u0026rdquo; My answer is \u0026ldquo;Now!\u0026rdquo; Short-term stock prices fluctuate wildly and are unpredictable. You could say, \u0026ldquo;The only predictable thing is unpredictability.\u0026rdquo; Since stocks generally rise in the long term, and future price movements are uncertain, the best approach is to invest and hold long-term, regardless of short-term fluctuations, and wait for the long-term upward trend to emerge.\nStocks tend to have higher returns over the long term, with a higher probability of rising than falling. Statistically, the ratio of up days to down days is approximately 55:45. Therefore, if you ask me if the market will rise or fall tomorrow, my answer is usually: \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know, and nobody in the world knows.\u0026rdquo; But if you insist on a guess, the statistically safer bet is that it will rise.\nSince the guess is always for a rise, the safest approach is to buy whenever you have money. When the probability of rising is higher than falling, and you can\u0026rsquo;t predict tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s movement, the best strategy is to \u0026ldquo;buy and wait for the opportunity,\u0026rdquo; not \u0026ldquo;wait for the opportunity to buy.\u0026rdquo;\nWe often hear older people lamenting, \u0026ldquo;If only I had invested in that stock 30 years ago, I would be\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Perhaps the best time to invest was 20 or 30 years ago, but the second-best time is now. Act as soon as you have the funds, lest you have the same regrets in a few decades. Life is short; how many decades can we afford to waste? How long can we allow ourselves to squander precious time?\nBuying anytime sounds simple, but it\u0026rsquo;s also very difficult. Try it yourself. If you can do it, you possess the basic qualities for investment success. As long as you adhere to the principles of long-term holding and diversified timing, you can buy stocks anytime.\nWhen to Sell - Don\u0026rsquo;t Sell\nBefore investing, prepare to hold for 20 years, research carefully, and after buying, put it aside and forget about it.\nA common investor dilemma is: \u0026ldquo;When should I sell?\u0026rdquo; Some experts say, \u0026ldquo;Choosing the right entry point is hard, choosing the right exit point is even harder.\u0026rdquo; Investment guru Philip Fisher famously advised, \u0026ldquo;If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is—almost never.\u0026rdquo; Warren Buffett, who became the richest man in America in 1982 through stock investments, exemplifies this. He holds stocks for an average of 4.5 years. So, my advice on when to sell is: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t sell.\u0026rdquo; Hold long-term and minimize trading.\nLong-term holding avoids frequent trading costs that erode returns. My research shows that with high-return investments like stocks, the longer the holding period, the lower the risk of loss. For example, with sufficient diversification, investing in the Taiwan stock market has never resulted in returns lower than bank interest rates for holding periods exceeding 11 years. This demonstrates that \u0026ldquo;diversify and hold long-term,\u0026rdquo; while seemingly simple, is an optimal investment strategy.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s so hard about not selling? It seems easy enough. But this is the most challenging of all investment rules and the most crucial factor for investment success. The difficulty lies in remaining unwavering, regardless of price fluctuations. This requires achieving the highest realm of financial management: \u0026ldquo;Own the stock, but not the stock price.\u0026rdquo;\nThe typical investor\u0026rsquo;s habit is to ignore a stock after buying it if the price falls, allowing it to continue declining and becoming a long-term loss. Conversely, if the price rises, they happily calculate their profits and readily sell after a 5% to 20% gain. Thus, \u0026ldquo;long-term investing\u0026rdquo; becomes synonymous with being trapped at a high price. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing remarkable about holding a losing stock long-term. The real key to investment success is remaining steadfast even when you\u0026rsquo;re profiting.\nJesse Livermore, author of Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, wrote: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been in Wall Street for many years, made fortunes, and lost them. My fortune-making has never depended on my forecasting ability but on my ability to hold positions firmly, unfazed by market fluctuations. You might find many people in the stock market who are incredibly accurate at predicting entry and exit points, yet they don\u0026rsquo;t make much money. It\u0026rsquo;s rare to find someone who can remain unmoved during a sustained market rally, and I\u0026rsquo;ve found this to be the hardest thing to learn in stock investing. Only by mastering this essence can investors make a fortune.\u0026rdquo;\nEndure the Falls, Wait Out the Rises\nTraditional thinking dictates: Buy low, sell high. However, a new perspective redefines investing as: selecting appropriate investment targets and holding them long-term. Successful investing requires mastering the eight-character mantra: \u0026ldquo;Endure the falls, wait out the rises.\u0026rdquo; Never be disheartened by price drops or tempted to sell at the first sign of a rally. Maintain a long-term perspective.\nWhy do most fortunes come from real estate, while fewer are made from stocks? The key is visibility. Real estate prices are largely invisible, while stock prices are constantly displayed. Real estate investors often achieve the \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; mentality, while stock investors, influenced by price fluctuations, rarely do. If stock investors could embrace the \u0026ldquo;buy and hold\u0026rdquo; approach, stock investing would be as powerful as real estate.\nIn the past 20 years, Cathay Life Insurance has consistently been among the top-performing listed companies in Taiwan. What\u0026rsquo;s their secret? They own real estate and stocks, and they buy and hold. This is their business philosophy, and it also applies to personal finance.\nLook at the success stories of investors like Lien Chan, Tsai Wan-lin, and Wang Yung-ching. They all adhered to the principle of \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t sell.\u0026rdquo; Tsai Wan-lin\u0026rsquo;s success stemmed from treating stocks like real estate. The Lien family\u0026rsquo;s success in stocks and real estate comes from their ability to hold long-term and remain unmoved.\nThe more complex the market fluctuations, the simpler the investment method.\nRandom Walk and Efficient Market Hypothesis # I must emphasize that \u0026ldquo;buy randomly, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t just a catchy phrase; it has a theoretical basis. In the 1950s, the American financial and investment community developed a prominent theory: the Random Walk Hypothesis.\nRandom Selection is the Best Strategy\nIt\u0026rsquo;s generally agreed that stock prices, like other commodities, fluctuate unpredictably. The Random Walk Hypothesis states that stock price movements are so complex that they resemble random changes, nearly impossible to predict. This hypothesis highlights the unpredictable nature of stock prices and, more importantly, leads to a simple yet crucial investment method: the Buy-and-Hold strategy, which is essentially \u0026ldquo;buy randomly, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Buy-and-Hold strategy means investing available funds immediately upon availability (rather than predicting market upswings), holding those investments long-term without selling (locking them away and ignoring short-term fluctuations), and selling only when funds are needed (not in anticipation of market downturns). In short, the Buy-and-Hold strategy advocates investing consistently, holding long-term, and selling only when necessary, without trying to time the market. If stock price movements follow the Random Walk Hypothesis, the best investment strategy is random selection and long-term holding – the very essence of \u0026ldquo;buy randomly, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell.\u0026rdquo;\nAnother implication of \u0026ldquo;buy randomly, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; is that analysis and prediction are futile. The Efficient Market Hypothesis states that in an efficient market, all information that could affect stock prices is quickly and fully reflected in those prices. By the time you receive information from analysis reports or publications, it\u0026rsquo;s already outdated and incorporated into the price. In other words, in an efficient market, stock prices are always in equilibrium, and no investor can consistently beat the market by collecting and analyzing information to gain excess returns.\nIn-depth Analysis is a Waste of Time\nThe Efficient Market Hypothesis, introduced by renowned financial expert Eugene Fama in the 1970s, emphasizes that you don\u0026rsquo;t need to be an analyst or expert to build wealth through investing. Painstakingly researching and analyzing stocks is a waste of time because most useful information is already reflected in the price. Studying this information offers no advantage. It\u0026rsquo;s better to invest your money and hold long-term.\nThe Efficient Market Hypothesis teaches us: Ignore the noise. Don\u0026rsquo;t waste time, effort, and money gathering information, as it\u0026rsquo;s mostly already priced in and thus worthless. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to learn complex analysis methods because most are ineffective.\nBy adopting the strategy advocated in this book – diversification, buying randomly, buying anytime, and not selling – you can achieve excellent returns.\n1. Short-term stock price movements are random, making it impossible to predict when prices will rise or fall.\n2. Although short-term stock prices are unpredictable, the long-term trend is upward due to continuous economic growth. Buying and holding stocks long-term, with the compounding effect offsetting risks over time, yields considerable average returns.\n3. Almost all publicly available information is already reflected in stock prices, making it unhelpful for investors.\n4. Most analytical methods used by investors are already factored into stock prices. Using commonly employed analysis techniques will not generate excess returns, meaning you won\u0026rsquo;t outperform the buy-and-hold strategy in the long run.\nFor years, facing the ever-changing investment world, I\u0026rsquo;ve sought a method that transcends the \u0026ldquo;busyness and blindness\u0026rdquo; of financial management. \u0026ldquo;Buy randomly, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; is the principle of simplifying complex problems.\n","date":"12 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005967/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law VIII","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"12 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/random-walk-hypothesis/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Random Walk Hypothesis","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/technical-analysis/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Technical Analysis","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-12","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%88%86%E6%95%A3%E9%A3%8E%E9%99%A9/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"分散风险","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-12","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E9%A2%84%E6%B5%8B/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"市场预测","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-12","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"技术分析","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-12","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%95%88%E7%8E%87%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E5%81%87%E8%AF%B4/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"效率市场假说","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-12","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E9%9A%8F%E6%9C%BA%E6%BC%AB%E6%AD%A5%E7%90%86%E8%AE%BA/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"随机漫步理论","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/blue-chip-stocks/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Blue-Chip Stocks","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/books/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Books","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/margin-trading/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Margin Trading","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/mutual-funds/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mutual Funds","type":"tags"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law Ⅵ: Escaping the Trap of Locked-in Investments # Don\u0026rsquo;t put all your eggs in one basket.\nDiversification and Long-Term Holding # Many investors often ask me: \u0026ldquo;Even if I believe that stocks and real estate have high returns and will rise in the long run, their prices fluctuate. Some investments will make a lot of money, while others will lose a lot of money. What should I invest in? What if the company I invest in goes bankrupt?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;When should I invest? What if I invest at the highest price point?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;When should I sell? What if I sell at the wrong time?\u0026rdquo; These questions reflect the risks inherent in investment and financial management.\nIncrease Returns, Reduce Risks\nThe eight-character mantra of investment and financial management is: Increase returns, reduce risks. The simplest way to increase returns is to invest assets in high-return instruments, such as stocks and real estate. However, high-return investments come with high risks. For example, stock and real estate prices fluctuate, leading to both profits and losses. Therefore, investors seeking high returns must bear the accompanying risks. However, these risks are generally undesirable for most investors. The correct financial management concept is not to avoid investment because of these risks. To achieve high returns, one should venture into investments with these risks, and then find ways to mitigate and minimize their impact.\nTherefore, reducing risks to avoid losses and increasing returns to create wealth are equally important for successful financial management. The primary goal of risk management is to find ways to reduce the risk of loss while increasing investment returns.\nInvesting in high-return targets faces three main risks:\nChoosing the wrong investment target. Choosing the wrong investment timing. Choosing the wrong selling timing. So how can we reduce these risks?\n1. Reduce the risk of choosing the wrong investment target - Diversify investment targets. 2. Reduce the risk of choosing the wrong investment timing - Diversify investment timing. 3. Reduce the risk of choosing the wrong selling timing - Long-term holding.\nReduce the Risk of Choosing the Wrong Investment Target - Diversify Investment Targets\nA conglomerate that owned a private jet once required its CEO and second-in-command to attend an international conference simultaneously. The conference organizers held a cocktail party to welcome these two VIPs. Guests and media eagerly awaited their arrival. Amidst the cheers, only the second-in-command, who had arrived on a private jet, was present. The CEO was still at the international airport going through customs. It turned out that they had taken separate planes to mitigate risk. Indeed, with frequent air disasters, if they had taken the same flight and an accident occurred, it would have severely impacted the company.\nThree thousand years ago, the Phoenicians invested heavily in building ships for international trade, venturing across the oceans. Successful voyages brought immense wealth; shipwrecks caused by hurricanes or typhoons resulted in total loss. Thus, the risks of overseas trade were enormous. A small group became incredibly wealthy through successful trade, while a few were ruined. However, the vast majority, fearing potential disasters, hesitated and missed out on substantial profits. Because few dared to take the risk, the limited supply of ships led to higher profits in maritime trade, benefiting those who invested.\nSomeone then devised an investment method that not only generated trade profits but also mitigated risks: diversification. The approach involved dividing the capital for one ship into ten parts, investing one-tenth in each of ten ships. This diversified the risk.\nDespite precautions, on average, three out of ten invested ships would sink due to storms. However, the profits from the remaining seven ships not only covered the losses but also yielded substantial returns. Diversification reduced risk while maintaining the return rate. The possibility of all ten ships encountering mishaps still existed, but it was minimal, significantly lower than the risk of investing in a single ship.\nThe most effective and widely adopted method for risk reduction is \u0026ldquo;diversification.\u0026rdquo; Diversification simply means increasing the variety of investments. Mark Twain once said, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t put all your eggs in one basket.\u0026rdquo; Distributing eggs across multiple baskets ensures that even if one basket falls, the remaining eggs are safe. This approach aims to reduce risk.\nThe investment environment is unpredictable and constantly changing. Fortuitous investments can yield high returns in the short term, but there\u0026rsquo;s also a high probability that chosen investments could plummet immediately after purchase. Most people avoid this risk by keeping their funds in risk-free instruments like bank deposits or government bonds. However, the correct investment perspective is to invest in \u0026ldquo;high-risk, high-expected return\u0026rdquo; targets to achieve high returns, while employing diversification to mitigate risks.\nInvest in ten ships. Three sink. The remaining ones still generate profits.\nPrinciples of Diversification # The method of diversifying risk has been practiced for millennia. The principle of diversification was introduced in the \u0026ldquo;Portfolio Theory\u0026rdquo; published in 1950 by Dr. Harry Markowitz, the 1990 Nobel laureate in economics. Diversification means increasing the types of investments. For example, when buying stocks, don\u0026rsquo;t buy just one; divide the investment amount and purchase multiple stocks. With sufficient capital, diversify beyond stocks into real estate, gold, art, and other asset classes.\nIncreasing Investment Types Offsets Relative Risk\nDiversification reduces risk because different investment targets don\u0026rsquo;t rise and fall in perfect unison. Even if they do, the magnitude of change varies. When several investments form a portfolio, the portfolio\u0026rsquo;s return is the weighted average of individual investments. Therefore, combining several high-return investments maintains high returns, while the portfolio\u0026rsquo;s risk is reduced as the fluctuations of individual investments offset each other. Increasing the variety of investments in a portfolio decreases the overall portfolio risk. This explains why diversification – increasing the types of investments – reduces risk.\nTherefore, when investing in stocks, don\u0026rsquo;t just buy one type. Purchase several different stocks. Adequate diversification typically involves investing in ten or more stocks. For investors with limited funds who want diversification, mutual funds are recommended. Most mutual funds invest in 30 or more stocks, so investing $10,000 in a mutual fund is equivalent to buying more than 30 stocks, providing sufficient diversification.\nPrinciples of Diversification\n1. Choose Investment Targets with Greater Negative Correlation\nThe less synchronized the price movements of investments in a portfolio, or the more they move in opposite directions, the better the diversification. Choose investments whose price trends are inversely related to the existing portfolio. For example, gold is a good tool for diversification. Historically, gold has been a high-risk investment, but its price tends to move inversely to stock prices. During major international events like wars, political turmoil, or inflation, stock prices often fall while gold prices rise. Applying this principle to stock investment, choose stocks from different industries for better diversification.\n2. Avoid Excessive Diversification\nWhile working as a consultant at a securities firm, I observed a woman in the VIP room with papers scattered across the table, gesturing frantically as if commanding an army. Assuming she was a major investor, I discreetly inquired with a broker and discovered her total investment was around $300,000, spread across over 30 stocks. While aiming for diversification, she over-diversified, increasing management costs and diminishing returns. Excessive diversification is counterproductive. Even Warren Buffett, with his vast portfolio, invests in only about a dozen stocks.\nGenerally, increasing investment types reduces portfolio risk, but the risk reduction effect diminishes with each added type. Holding numerous investments for fun is acceptable, but if the goal is risk reduction, understand that the diversification effect diminishes with increasing variety. The difference in risk between holding 30 stocks and 20 stocks is negligible. Beyond a certain point, risk reduction plateaus, and further diversification offers no additional benefit.\nBalance diversification against management costs. Diversification aims to reduce risk by increasing investment types across different instruments and targets. While increasing types reduces risk, it increases management costs as tracking multiple assets becomes complex.\nPeter Lynch, in his book \u0026ldquo;One Up On Wall Street,\u0026rdquo; stated: \u0026ldquo;Investing in stocks is like having children – if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the ability to raise them, don\u0026rsquo;t have too many. No one says you have to invest in five or more stocks every time.\u0026rdquo;\nMethods of Diversification\nDiversification methods include various investment instruments, targets, and regions:\n1. Diversification of Investment Instruments: Invest in different instruments, such as stocks, real estate, overseas mutual funds, art, and gold.\n2. Diversification of Investment Targets: Invest in various targets. For example, when investing in stocks, don\u0026rsquo;t focus on just one. Spread funds across four or five or more stocks. Avoid concentrating on a few industries, as stocks within the same industry tend to move together. In real estate, if funds allow, invest in different property types like apartments, offices, shops, and studios, and diversify locations.\n3. Diversification of Investment Regions: Diversify investments across different countries or regions. Some investors worry about concentrating assets in one region due to political, war, and exchange rate risks. Distributing assets geographically mitigates these risks.\nConcentrated Investment Requires Confidence\nDiversification reduces the likelihood of worst-case scenarios, but it also eliminates the possibility of the best-case scenarios. Full diversification makes extreme outcomes unlikely, resulting in returns close to the average.\nSome argue for concentrating investments: \u0026ldquo;Put all your eggs in one basket and watch it carefully.\u0026rdquo; Admittedly, many successful investors concentrate their holdings. Few individuals are experts in both stocks and real estate. The choice between diversification and concentration depends on individual circumstances. If you\u0026rsquo;re proficient in a specific investment area, concentration might be preferable, offering potentially higher returns. For example, a real estate expert wouldn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily diversify into stocks. Over-diversification could have hindered their success.\nIf you lack confidence in most investment areas, diversification is recommended. While it might not yield exceptional returns, it protects against significant losses. Diversified returns are close to average returns. As long as the chosen investments tend to appreciate over the long term, like stocks and real estate, achieving average returns is sufficient for wealth building.\nMitigate the risk of incorrect investment timing by diversifying investment timing.\nDiversifying Investment Timing # Diversification applies to both investment targets and timing. To mitigate the risk of mistiming the market, distribute investments over time. Instead of investing a lump sum at once, divide it into portions and invest at different times.\nFoolproof Method for Investment Timing\nTwo methods achieve diversified investment timing. The first is to invest whenever funds are available. A friend of mine invests $10,000 in stocks whenever his bank balance reaches $15,000, keeping his balance below $5,000. He also buys different stocks each time, diversifying both target and timing.\nAnother method is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), which is regularly investing a fixed amount in mutual funds. Investors contribute a set amount at regular intervals (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or annually) at the prevailing net asset value (NAV). A specified amount is automatically deducted from a designated bank account on a specific date each month and invested in a pre-selected mutual fund. Since the investment amount is fixed, but the NAV fluctuates, the number of units purchased varies. This naturally leads to buying more units when prices are low and fewer when prices are high. Over the long term, DCA offers considerable returns and mitigates price fluctuation risks.\nReducing the Risk of Choosing the Wrong Selling Timing - Long-Term Holding\nLong-term holding reduces the likelihood of losses. Choose long-term investment instead of being forced into it after becoming trapped.\nYears ago, during training at Merrill Lynch, a securities analyst stated: \u0026ldquo;Statistically, the stock market rises 55% of the days and falls 45%. The problem is, we don\u0026rsquo;t know which days will be up.\u0026rdquo; The ratio of gains and losses in the Taiwan stock market is similar.\nTherefore, if you, like the experts, don\u0026rsquo;t know whether the market will rise or fall tomorrow, the smartest approach is to guess it will rise. The more you guess, the higher your probability of being correct. If you consistently predict a market rise, the best strategy is: Buy whenever you have money, and hold. This seemingly simple approach is often the most effective. Many fortunes have been built this way.\nStocks and real estate are characterized by high returns and high risks. Due to their inherent risk, prices fluctuate in the short term, but their high returns generate a long-term upward trend. The longer the holding period, the lower the probability of loss. My research on the Taiwan stock market showed that the probability of gains and losses changes with the holding period, as shown below:\nRelationship between Stock Holding Period and Probability of Gain\nHolding Period Probability of Gain (%) Probability of Loss (%) 1 Day 55 45 1 Month 60 40 1 Year 66 34 5 Years 99 1 10 Years 100 0 The table demonstrates that while stock prices fluctuate in the short term, the probability of loss decreases with longer holding periods. A one-day holding has a 45% chance of loss, which decreases to 40% for one month, 34% for one year, and a mere 1% for five years, making a loss almost impossible. Holding for ten years or more eliminates the possibility of loss entirely. Long-term holding not only reduces the likelihood of loss but is also crucial for increasing returns.\nHow can we build wealth from small investments? The key is the power of compounding, which requires both high returns and time. Investing in high-return instruments like stocks and real estate and holding them long-term allows compounding to work its magic, accelerating wealth growth. The longer the holding period (decades), the more apparent the high return rate becomes, and the investment loss risk rapidly decreases.\nThe goal of risk management isn\u0026rsquo;t to eliminate all risk, but to acknowledge its inevitable presence, understand it, analyze it, and then mitigate it. Never wait for absolute safety; it\u0026rsquo;s an illusion. High-expected return investments always carry risk, and no strategy can eliminate all risks.\nDiversification reduces individual investment fluctuations, while long-term holding neutralizes short-term price swings. Investing in stocks and real estate requires accepting short-term and individual investment volatility. By diversifying and holding long-term, these risks are mitigated, reducing overall investment risk. In the long run, this strategy allows investors to benefit from the high returns offered by stocks and real estate.\n","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005965/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law Ⅵ","type":"posts"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law Seven: Mastering Stock Investment # Choose the right stocks, hold them long-term, and watch their value grow.\nThe Secret to Liu Qiude\u0026rsquo;s Fortune # It is said that Tsai Wan-lin, once Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s richest man and the world\u0026rsquo;s fifth wealthiest individual, declared at a Cathay Life Insurance executive meeting, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t just want to be rich; I want those who strive with me to be rich as well. Those of you present with less than ten million in assets, please raise your hands.\u0026rdquo; The executives remained silent. Not because no one dared to raise their hands, nor because no one possessed such wealth, but because for Cathay Life\u0026rsquo;s senior management, many boasted fortunes exceeding one hundred million.\nLiu Qiude, the current Vice President, who joined Cathay Life in his twenties, became a billionaire by following the right person and investing in the right stock. From the beginning of his career, besides the company\u0026rsquo;s stock options, he consistently invested any spare cash in buying shares from colleagues looking to sell. When Taiwan faced political or economic crises, and some Cathay employees rushed to sell their holdings, he bought them all. Holding these shares for two to three decades, without ever selling, he effortlessly became a billionaire. He himself couldn\u0026rsquo;t say exactly how many shares he owned, stating, \u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t know the exact number of Cathay Life shares until they are all transferred.\u0026rdquo;\nUnsure of His Own Dividend Earnings\nIn 1981, the average price of a Cathay Life share (1000 shares) was about NT$45,000. After 15 years of stock dividends, by 1996, this had increased to 48.7 shares (see table below). Calculated at a market price of NT$160,000 per share, the market value would be approximately NT$7.795 million, a 171-fold increase in 15 years. This impressive growth doesn\u0026rsquo;t even include the cash dividends received over the years. With such a staggering rate of return, it\u0026rsquo;s no wonder Liu Qiude is unsure of his exact share count. He\u0026rsquo;s likely worth well over a billion, perhaps even ten billion or more.\nCathay Life Insurance 15-Year Stock Dividend and Capital Increase\nYear Cash Dividend Stock Dividend Accumulated Shares (Assuming 1 share purchased in 1981) 1981 3 - 1 1982 2 0 1 1983 1 150 1.15 1984 1 300 1.50 1985 1 300 1.94 1986 1.2 300 2.53 1987 1 300 3.28 1988 1 400 4.60 1989 1 500 6.90 1990 1 500 10.35 1991 1.5 500 15.52 1992 1.2 300 20.18 1993 0 250 25.22 1994 1.5 400 35.31 1995 1.5 200 42.37 1996 1.5 150 48.42 Source: (Taiwan) Economic Daily News\nThe Tsai family themselves followed a similar strategy. To maintain control of Cathay Life, they held their shares long-term through investment companies. Tsai Chen-yu, Chairman of First Commercial Bank, pointed out that selling these shares was practically impossible; they had become like real estate. One of the main reasons Tsai Wan-lin became Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s richest man was his ability to hold Cathay Life stock long-term.\nCathay Life isn\u0026rsquo;t the only company that has created immense wealth for ordinary white-collar workers. Professional managers at several other large Taiwanese companies also accumulated significant fortunes. According to the Taiwan Stock Exchange, from the end of 1990 to April 30, 1996, the average return on all stocks was 35.41%. During this period, holding United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) stock would have yielded a return of 726.04%, Acer 421.54%, Tatung 335.88%, China Development Financial Holding Corporation 225.55%, Uni-President Enterprises Corporation 191.30%, and Nan Ya Plastics Corporation 123.77%. These examples demonstrate that long-term investment in blue-chip stocks can lead to substantial gains.\nThe higher the economic growth rate, the higher the average long-term stock market return.\nWhy Stocks Offer High Returns # Why is long-term stock investment profitable? First, I must clarify a key concept that all stock investors should understand. Investing in stocks generates profits primarily because the companies you invest in earn money, which ultimately belongs to the shareholders. Your profit doesn\u0026rsquo;t rely on other investors losing money.\nStocks represent ownership in a company. Stockholders are shareholders of the enterprise, and they have two inherent rights: the right to share in the company\u0026rsquo;s profits and the right to distribute remaining assets. If the company is profitable, the profits ultimately go to the shareholders. Similarly, when a company owns assets, those assets ultimately belong to the shareholders. Therefore, investing in profitable or asset-rich companies can, in the long run, not only yield dividends from corporate earnings but also a share of the value when assets are liquidated.\nAverage Stock Market Return of 17%-18%\nThe long-term price appreciation of stocks is primarily based on two factors:\n(1) Increased corporate profitability leads to higher dividends for shareholders, thus driving up stock prices.\n(2) An increase in the value of a company\u0026rsquo;s assets, such as real estate or investments in other stocks, ultimately benefits shareholders, therefore causing stock prices to rise.\nConsequently, if a company\u0026rsquo;s profitability continues to rise, or the value of its assets, like real estate, continues to appreciate, stock prices will inevitably rise in the long run, and shareholder returns will increase accordingly.\nOver the past few decades, Taiwanese companies have experienced stable profit growth and rising real estate prices, resulting in stock market returns far exceeding bank deposit interest rates. Data shows that over the past 25 years, the average annual return on the Taiwan stock market has been around 17%-18%. In Europe, the United States, Japan, and other developed countries, the average annual return over a 10-year period is typically between 12%-17%. Simply put, the higher the economic growth rate, the higher the average long-term stock market return.\nAccording to research by several scholars, the Taiwan Weighted Stock Index, starting at 100 points in 1966, reached 12,682 points over 27 years, before falling back to 2,458 points by the end of 1993. This translates to an average annual return of over 17%. These calculations assume that investors consistently bought stocks whenever they had funds and held them until the present without selling.\nThe Taiwan Stock Exchange conducted another study showing that if you had invested in the stock market 20 years ago and held your investments until the end of 1994 without trading, your return would have been at least 13.7 times your initial investment, with a maximum potential return of 1,384 times. This demonstrates the impressive potential of the Taiwan stock market.\nLearning from the past can inform the future. The Taiwan stock market has historically delivered high long-term returns. Even in recent years, investors who avoided the frenzy of speculative buying and instead opted for diversified, long-term holdings have seen decent returns. Looking ahead, I firmly believe that readers who adhere to the principles of diversification and long-term holding can still achieve substantial results through stock investment.\nStock Investment vs. Real Estate Investment\nThis book recommends two investment tools with high potential returns: stocks and real estate. Which is better? The answer depends on individual financial circumstances, product knowledge, risk tolerance, and tax situation. There\u0026rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all solution. However, stock investment offers several advantages over real estate:\nReal estate investment requires larger capital, often over NT$1 million, which can be a barrier for young people entering the workforce. Stock investment, on the other hand, can be started with just tens of thousands, or even a few thousand NT dollars.\nLong-term stock investment generally incurs lower taxes than real estate. In Taiwan, stock investments are exempt from capital gains tax, with the primary tax being securities transaction tax. Long-term investors who avoid frequent trading pay limited taxes, and capital gains upon selling are tax-free. Real estate investment requires annual property and land taxes, and transaction taxes upon sale.\nStock trading is simpler than real estate transactions. Buying or selling listed stocks requires just a phone call, and payment is made via remittance. Purchased shares are held by a centralized depository, adding to the convenience. Real estate transactions involve complex procedures for transferring ownership, which can be time-consuming. Property management and maintenance can also be demanding.\nIn conclusion, for investors who diversify and hold long-term, stocks are an excellent investment tool for individuals and families. Unfortunately, most stock investors are unable to withstand the fluctuations of the market and the temptation of short-term gains. Frequent trading often leads to losses due to high transaction costs. This explains why, despite the high average long-term returns of the stock market, few people become wealthy through stock investment.\nCan Stocks Maintain High Returns in the Future?\nInvestors often ask me, \u0026ldquo;The high average annual returns of over 20% in the past were due to Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s rapid economic growth over the past two to three decades. Now that Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s economic growth has slowed, can we still expect such high returns in the future?\u0026rdquo;\nIf the question is whether the Taiwan stock market can maintain an average annual return of over 30%, I believe that\u0026rsquo;s unlikely. A country or region\u0026rsquo;s stock market return is directly influenced by the profitability of its companies, which is essentially linked to the economic growth rate. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s economy is maturing. While the average annual growth rate was around 9% for the past few decades, it\u0026rsquo;s now around 6%, and this trend is expected to continue.\nWith a declining economic growth rate, it\u0026rsquo;s improbable that the stock market will maintain returns above 20%. However, I estimate that future stock returns should remain above 15%. This is based on the observation that in developed economies like the US, Japan, and Europe, long-term stock returns remain between 10%-15% even after their economies mature. Although Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s economic growth rate may decrease, a 10% growth rate is still impressive compared to other regions, making Taiwanese stocks a worthwhile investment. Furthermore, Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s increasing financial liberalization is likely to attract foreign investment, which will further boost the stock market\u0026rsquo;s performance.\nUntapped gold mines are plentiful; careful selection leads to boundless profits.\nChoosing the Right Stocks # Generally, stocks can be categorized into four types: listed stocks, over-the-counter (OTC) stocks, unlisted stocks, and mutual funds. Each type has distinct characteristics that investors should understand to avoid regrets.\nVarying Returns, Liquidity, and Security\nListed stocks are traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. They offer high long-term average returns, good liquidity, transparent financial and business operations, centralized trading with fair market pricing, low taxes for long-term investors (exempt from capital gains tax), and dividends eligible for tax exemptions. Listed stocks offer greater security than unlisted stocks. I recommend that readers with long-term savings consider diversifying their investments in listed stocks and holding them long-term.\nOTC stocks are traded on the over-the-counter market through negotiated pricing. The trading mechanism is similar to listed stocks, but with lower trading volume and liquidity. Generally, the listing requirements for OTC stocks are less stringent than for listed stocks, with lower requirements for capital and profitability, resulting in lower security. One disadvantage of OTC stocks is that their dividends are not eligible for tax exemptions.\nUnlisted stocks are not traded on either the stock exchange or the OTC market. They have lower liquidity, no fair market price, lack transparent financial and business operations, and are not subject to regulatory oversight by the Securities and Futures Bureau (SFB) and the stock exchange, resulting in higher risk and lower security. Their dividends are also ineligible for tax exemptions. While unlisted stocks offer higher potential returns and the possibility of discovering hidden gems, their lack of oversight makes them risky. I recommend focusing on listed stocks, which are sufficient for building wealth. Invest in unlisted stocks only if you have a thorough understanding of the company, its valuation, and trust in its management.\nThe Best Tool for Beginner Stock Investors\nMutual funds, or investment trust funds, pool money from small investors, entrusting it to professional investment management companies. Investment experts manage these funds with a diversified approach, and the returns belong to the original investors. Mutual funds are classified into open-end and closed-end funds based on their issuance and trading methods.\nOpen-end funds allow investors to buy and sell shares at any time based on the net asset value. The total amount of the fund fluctuates as investors buy and sell shares. Closed-end funds have a fixed number of shares. Investors wishing to purchase these funds must buy from existing shareholders. Similarly, existing shareholders must sell their shares on the open market; they cannot redeem them from the issuing company. Funds traded on the stock exchange are closed-end funds, and their transaction tax is only 1%.\nMutual funds are professionally managed by experts and offer diversification, generally providing good returns. However, their long-term average returns may be lower than the overall market due to management fees, custodian fees, transaction fees, and other expenses. Because of their smaller investment units and lower risk compared to listed stocks, mutual funds are an ideal investment tool for beginners. To avoid long-term fees, I recommend index funds, such as the Formosa Fund or CTBC Financial ETF 0050, which offer better long-term returns.\nThis book primarily recommends investing in listed stocks due to their stable long-term average returns. Unless you have specific reasons for investing in other types of stocks, you should allocate most of your funds to listed stocks or stock mutual funds. The most important reason is that long-term investment in listed stocks is sufficient for building wealth.\nMargin Trading is Unsuitable for Listed Stock Investment\nSome investors ask, \u0026ldquo;If the long-term return on stocks is higher than the margin interest rate, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t margin trading accelerate wealth accumulation?\u0026rdquo; Theoretically, yes. If you can diversify and hold listed stocks long-term, margin trading can leverage financial leverage to accelerate wealth growth. However, in practice, most people who use margin trading for stock investment lose money.\nWhy? The reason is simple. It\u0026rsquo;s the same reason why many investors lose money in the stock market despite its high long-term average returns. Daily stock price fluctuations tempt investors to chase short-term gains. They become driven by greed and fear, leading to frequent trading, often buying high and selling low, which ultimately results in losses.\nThis behavior is already prevalent with fully funded stock purchases. Margin trading exacerbates the problem. The leverage magnifies the gains and losses, further tempting investors to chase short-term profits while increasing the psychological pressure. This leads to even more frequent trading and ultimately greater losses.\nMy research on margin trading balances for listed stocks shows that margin balances are lower when stock prices are low. When prices rise significantly, investors begin using margin, with margin balances peaking when stock prices are high. This indicates that investors are often hesitant to use margin when they should, and aggressively use it when they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t, when prices are already high. In short, margin trading for listed stocks often leads to mistakes and should generally be avoided.\n","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005966/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law Ⅶ","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/stock-investment/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Stock Investment","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/taiwan-stock-market/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Taiwan Stock Market","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-11","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%85%B1%E5%90%8C%E5%9F%BA%E9%87%91/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"共同基金","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-11","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%88%86%E6%95%A3%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"分散投资","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-11","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%8F%B0%E6%B9%BE%E8%82%A1%E5%B8%82/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"台湾股市","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-11","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E7%BB%A9%E4%BC%98%E8%82%A1/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"绩优股","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-11","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E8%82%A1%E7%A5%A8%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"股票投资","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-11","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E8%9E%8D%E8%B5%84/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"融资","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/credit/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Credit","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/loan/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Loan","type":"tags"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law IV: Making Money with Other People\u0026rsquo;s Money # By applying the principle of financial leverage, an investment of 500 million can double your business.\nUtilizing Leveraged Investing # The path to wealth through investment relies on \u0026ldquo;making money with money.\u0026rdquo; Therefore, the prerequisite for investment is having capital. A common dilemma faced by individuals when investing is, \u0026ldquo;What if I don\u0026rsquo;t have enough money?\u0026rdquo; This can lead to missed opportunities. This book proposes a solution: \u0026ldquo;If you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough money, but someone else does and is willing to lend it to you, then borrow it.\u0026rdquo; This is the highest realm of investment management—leveraged investing.\nChen Youhao, President of the Tuntex Group: The Money-Making Method of Borrowing and Rolling\nStarting in the textile industry, Chen Youhao used financial leverage to rapidly expand the Tuntex Group into chemical fibers, construction, cement, hotels, petrochemicals, and other fields. With over 30 affiliated companies, it became one of the top 15 largest corporate groups in Taiwan. He also planned to invest nearly 7 billion USD in Taiwan and Thailand to expand chemical fiber plants.\nTuntex\u0026rsquo;s growth never stopped, and its debt continued to rise. In 1995, Tuntex Group\u0026rsquo;s core business, Tonwin Construction, had total assets of 59.6 billion TWD, revenue of 15.7 billion TWD, and net profit after tax of 2.6 billion TWD, but its debt ratio was still as high as 60.99%.\nA graduate of the Department of Economics at National Taiwan University, Chen Youhao always prided himself on his sophisticated money-making method of borrowing and rolling. He had full confidence in Tuntex\u0026rsquo;s financial management. His financial principles were: 1/3 self-owned capital, the rest borrowed from financial institutions; current assets must be greater than current liabilities, with a current ratio greater than 100%; and the ratio of self-owned capital to debt must not exceed 1/2.\nChen Youhao emphasized that whenever the company\u0026rsquo;s debt ratio approached its limit, he would strictly control it, so the company\u0026rsquo;s financial situation remained normal. However, whenever the construction industry was in a downturn, Tuntex would be plagued by rumors of financial difficulties. In June 1995, due to capital needs, Chen Youhao pledged 46.5 million shares of Tonwin, setting a record for the highest number of shares pledged by directors and supervisors that month. Chen Youhao repeatedly assured the public that Tuntex\u0026rsquo;s finances were absolutely sound.\nDespite the rumors damaging the company\u0026rsquo;s image, Chen Youhao firmly believed that reasonable borrowing could enable the company to earn more profits. He was also confident that businesses funded by loans would be profitable because the return on investment was higher than the interest rate on loans.\nIs Borrowing to Invest Wrong?\nIs borrowing money for investment appropriate? Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet, \u0026ldquo;Neither a borrower nor a lender be.\u0026rdquo; This was once considered a golden rule. Our elders often warned their children not to borrow money from others or lend money to others; borrowing was not considered respectable and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.\nIndeed, most stories of financial ruin are caused by debt, such as the cases of Tsai Chen-chou of the Tenth Credit Cooperative and the stock market tycoon Lei Borong. Countless examples of bankruptcy caused by debt make people fear and avoid it.\nHowever, among the famous wealthy individuals we know, such as Wang Yongqing, Kao Ching-yuan, Chang Yung-fa, and Wu Ho-Su, who didn\u0026rsquo;t rely on borrowing to invest in their journey from rags to riches? The answer is \u0026ldquo;none.\u0026rdquo; Moreover, the more successful people are at making money, the more they tend to borrow. Looking at the financial statements of listed companies, are there any renowned high-performing enterprises in Taiwan, such as Formosa Plastics, Uni-President, and Evergreen, that have zero debt? The message is clear: successful tycoons, like successful businesses, rarely achieve their wealth without using other people\u0026rsquo;s money. In business management, appropriate borrowing is not only necessary but also reasonable.\nIf Shakespeare were alive in the 21st century and understood how capitalism works and how people become wealthy, he might change his words to: \u0026ldquo;If you have no money, but others do and are willing to lend it to you, then borrow.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter reviewing these characteristics of success, reflect on your own financial situation. What percentage of your investment funds comes from borrowing? If, like most people, 100% of your investments are made with your own funds, you are overlooking an important tool for building wealth: borrowing.\nBorrowing is a Crucial Tool for Wealth Creation\nAmerican investment consultant Robert Allen repeatedly emphasizes in his bestselling book Creating Wealth: \u0026ldquo;You cannot become rich by investing without borrowing.\u0026rdquo; I disagree with this argument. The examples in Chapter 1 of this book clearly demonstrate that with proper financial management, one can become a billionaire without relying on borrowed investments. The American investment master Warren Buffett does not advocate leveraged investing. Without debt, he is a prime example of building wealth solely through his own funds. However, there is a prerequisite for accumulating wealth using only your own funds: long-term patient waiting. Warren Buffett only rose to prominence after three to four decades of investing.\nAlthough Robert Allen\u0026rsquo;s argument that \u0026ldquo;you cannot become rich without borrowing\u0026rdquo; is incorrect, I must admit that the \u0026ldquo;leveraged investing\u0026rdquo; he advocates is an important means of building wealth, especially for those who want to accelerate the speed of wealth creation. Leveraged investing is a tool that should not be ignored.\nIn conclusion, whether you want to accelerate wealth accumulation or can tolerate the pressure of leveraged investing, you must understand the nature and impact of leveraged investing before deciding if this tool is right for you.\nLeveraged investing is a powerful tool, but it must be used wisely. It is possible to build wealth without borrowing. Leveraged investing, when used correctly, can accelerate wealth accumulation. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of leveraged investing, but be very careful. Aim high with your business goals, Once decided, go for it and never back down. The key to success in business lies in courage and strategy.\nWeng Damming\u0026rsquo;s Revival of the Family Business # In Taiwan, there are quite a few entrepreneurs skilled in financial leverage. Besides Chen Youhao, the president of the Tuntex Group, Weng Damming, the head of the Hualon Group, is also a master of this art.\nWeng Damming, the head of the Hualon Group, became a highly controversial figure due to his unconventional style. After the death of his father, Weng Mingchang, Weng Damming shouldered the heavy responsibility of reviving the family business. Starting in textiles, the Hualon Group owned Hualon Textile, Hualon Microelectronics, Yixin Trading, Jiashin Livestock, and Kuo Hua Life Insurance, among other affiliated companies.\nWeng Damming adopted a high-leverage approach to business management. In 1994, the Hualon Group had total assets of 130 billion TWD and debts as high as over 50 billion TWD, of which over 30 billion TWD were short-term debts. He used the stocks or real estate of affiliated companies as collateral for bank loans, with a pledge ratio of nearly 60%. Therefore, during the stock market crash and the real estate downturn, Weng Damming was troubled by rumors of financial difficulties. Due to the sluggish stock and real estate markets, the collateral value of the Hualon Group was insufficient, requiring him to supplement the collateral or face the pressure of being \u0026ldquo;liquidated.\u0026rdquo; However, the seasoned Weng Damming, with his flexible financial management, once again demonstrated that the financial crisis was just a false alarm.\nAs Hualon Textile, the parent company of the Hualon Group, enjoyed stable profits and increased earnings with the gradual recovery of the textile industry, Weng Damming was able to borrow money fearlessly and aggressively expand into new businesses. With a gambler\u0026rsquo;s mentality, Weng Damming can be said to have maximized the principle of financial leverage. The story of this legendary figure shows us both the rewards and risks of leveraged investing.\nThe Principle of Financial Leverage\nAct within your means; don\u0026rsquo;t over-leverage, or you risk being shaken out. In finance, borrowing is known as \u0026ldquo;financial leverage.\u0026rdquo; Simply put, leverage is the principle of using a small force to achieve a large effect. Humans discovered the power of leverage early on and used it to move or lift heavy objects. The ancients used the principle of leverage to create magnificent engineering marvels such as the Great Wall and the pyramids. Modern wealthy individuals use the principle of financial leverage to create immense fortunes. Archimedes once said, \u0026ldquo;Give me a place to stand, and I shall move the earth.\u0026rdquo; In investment management, financial leverage implies: \u0026ldquo;Lend me enough money, and I can make any large investment.\u0026rdquo;\nLeveraged investing involves borrowing other people\u0026rsquo;s money to make larger investments, thus utilizing the leverage effect. Proper use of leverage can turn small amounts of money into large profits. Conversely, improper use can also lead to significant losses with small amounts of money. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example to help readers understand how financial leverage works. Suppose you buy a house with 10 million in cash. A year later, you are fortunate enough to sell it for 13 million, making a 30% profit (R1). If you only paid 3 million in cash for the house and borrowed the remaining 7 million from the bank at a 10% interest rate, and then sold it for 13 million a year later, your profit margin would increase to 77% (R2). Conversely, if the house price unfortunately drops by 30% after a year, and you sell it for 7 million, the person who bought it entirely in cash would lose 30% (R3). The investor who borrowed 7 million would see their loss expand to 123% (R4), meaning not only is the original investment lost, but they are also in debt. The calculation of the above rates of return is as follows:\nR1=(1300−1000)/1000=30%R2=(1300−1000−700×10%)/300=77%R3=(700−1000)/1000=−30%R4=(700−1000−700×10%)/300=−123%(Calculations in units of 10,000)\nFrom the above example, we can clearly see how debt leverage exerts the power of \u0026ldquo;using a small force to achieve a large effect.\u0026rdquo; When the return on investment is higher than the interest rate on the loan, leveraged investing will increase the return on investment. When the return on investment is lower than the interest rate on the loan, the return on investment will decrease due to the borrowing.\nThe main reason for the leverage effect is that loan interest is a cost that must be paid under any circumstances. Regardless of the investment return, the interest cost of borrowing remains fixed. Therefore, when the investment return is greater than the loan cost, the excess profit belongs to the borrower, creating a positive leverage effect and naturally increasing the return on investment of the principal. However, when the investment return is less than the loan interest cost, the borrower must bear the difference, resulting in a negative leverage effect, which reduces the return on the principal. This is especially true when the investment incurs a loss, as the borrowing cost will magnify the loss.\nFinancial leverage is like a seesaw, It can lift you very high, It can also cause you to fall hard.\nTwo Major Principles of Borrowing # Financial leverage is like a seesaw: it can lift you very high or cause you to fall hard, depending on whether the leverage effect is positive or negative. The key factor determining the direction of the leverage effect is which is higher: the return on investment or the interest rate on the loan. If the return on investment is greater than the interest rate, the leverage effect is positive. Conversely, if the return on investment is lower than the interest rate, the leverage effect becomes detrimental.\nReturn on Investment Must Be Higher Than the Interest Rate\nTherefore, when deciding whether to use leveraged investing, the first things to consider are: What is the purpose of the loan? What is the expected return on investment for the target investment? Is it higher than the loan interest rate? If the return on investment of the targeted investment is significantly lower than the borrowing rate, the idea of leveraged investing should be dismissed early on. Otherwise, the result will certainly be detrimental rather than beneficial. If you can\u0026rsquo;t understand what the expected return on investment is or whether the return is higher than the interest rate, then I advise you to understand these issues before borrowing!\nDebt is synonymous with risk. Increasing debt increases risk and the possibility of personal or family bankruptcy. There are two major principles of leveraged investing:\nThe expected return on investment must be greater than the interest rate on the loan. For example, if the loan interest rate is 11%, it\u0026rsquo;s only worthwhile if the after-tax return on investment is above 11%. In the worst-case scenario, your cash income must be sufficient to cover the principal and interest payments. For instance, if the investment price falls instead of rises after a few years, you must have enough cash income to repay the principal and interest on time. Furthermore, investors must keep in mind that leveraged investing should not be based on the expectation that the price of the investment target will definitely rise, but rather on the preparation for a price drop. Therefore, you should only engage in leveraged investing if you can still afford the interest payments even if the price continues to fall. You must also be able to withstand the psychological pressure that comes with leveraged investing.\nAvoiding Improper Borrowing\nSome readers may feel smug after reading this section because they are already engaged in what they consider leveraged investing. Upon further inquiry, however, it turns out they are borrowing money to buy lottery tickets, futures, or other speculative products, or even taking out loans to purchase consumer goods. I must emphasize that these actions do not constitute proper \u0026ldquo;leveraged investing.\u0026rdquo;\nFutures markets, margin trading (such as foreign exchange and bonds), or any gambling activities like lotteries and horse racing all have negative expected returns. Long-term participation will inevitably lead to financial ruin. Coupled with the deadly effect of borrowing, the result will undoubtedly be rapid bankruptcy. Therefore, no matter how alluring these games are, remember: It\u0026rsquo;s okay to indulge occasionally for recreational purposes, but never borrow money to participate, or you will accelerate your path to bankruptcy with dire consequences.\nAnother point to remind readers of is to avoid borrowing money to purchase consumer goods. Borrowing to consume is like using future money to create \u0026ldquo;false wealth.\u0026rdquo; Unless absolutely necessary, the concept of borrowing for consumption should be avoided. Otherwise, the family\u0026rsquo;s financial situation will be burdened.\nFor banks, consumer loans are extremely risky and require high interest rates. Generally, consumer loan interest rates are above 10%. Readers should understand that high-return investments have an amazing compounding effect. Similarly, high-interest loans also have a dramatic compounding effect. Take car loans, for example. Assuming a 20% loan interest rate, after three and a half years, you will have to repay double the amount. This means that if you borrow money to buy a car now, three and a half years later, not only will the original car have depreciated significantly, but you will effectively have to pay for two new cars of the same model. My advice on car loans is: don\u0026rsquo;t take them. Wait until you can afford to pay in cash. Car loan interest rates are usually very high, often exceeding 15%, although there are occasional promotional periods with lower rates. Fundamentally, except for commercial vehicles, cars are consumer goods with no investment return. From an investment perspective, borrowing for car purchases is highly inadvisable.\nUncontrolled Consumer Lending Easily Leads to Bankruptcy\nCredit cards, now a ubiquitous form of plastic currency worldwide, are also a typical example of consumer loans. Since the popularization of credit cards, consumer behavior has undergone significant changes. While credit cards offer great convenience, their widespread use has led to a surge in bankruptcy cases among American families, with outstanding credit card debt exceeding 700 billion USD. Some may wonder: how can credit cards lead to bankruptcy if you only spend what you have? In fact, from a borrowing perspective, credit cards have an irresistible allure.\nThe greatest temptation of credit card borrowing lies in its simplicity. With just a signature, you can make purchases in advance and even borrow cash from the bank, subtly inflating your spending power. Remember: when using credit cards, never spend more than you can afford to repay each month. Credit card interest rates are often above 20%, so you should always pay off your credit card balance promptly. My advice is: \u0026ldquo;If you can\u0026rsquo;t control your spending urges, it\u0026rsquo;s best not to apply for a credit card. If you apply for one for convenience, never use it for the sake of credit. Use it only when it truly offers convenience.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile using credit cards for borrowing is convenient, those who entertain this idea should first understand the destructive power of a 20% interest rate. As mentioned earlier, if you save 14,000 per year and invest it in an investment tool with a 20% annual return, after 40 years, the 560,000 invested will grow to 102.81 million due to the power of compounding. Similarly, if someone borrows 14,000 per year on a credit card for 40 years, totaling 560,000, with a 20% interest rate, they will have to repay the bank 102.81 million after 40 years. This explains why the prevalence of credit card debt in the United States has historically led to numerous bankruptcies.\nAnother common type of loan is a mortgage. Generally, mortgages are a sound form of leveraged investing because, in the long run, the average return on real estate is above 20%, while typical mortgage interest rates are around 10%, which meets the first principle of leveraged investing: the expected return on investment is higher than the interest rate on the loan. Whether it meets the second principle depends on the purchase conditions. In recent years, with the real estate market downturn and oversupply, some pre-sale housing promotions offer \u0026ldquo;70% financing,\u0026rdquo; allowing you to own a 10 million house with only a 3 million down payment. This is quite appealing, but investors often overlook the fact that while borrowing 7 million sounds great, they must be able to afford the monthly principal and interest payments of over 70,000. Without considering this, there is a risk of foreclosure and being forced to sell at a low price within months of purchase, suffering losses before enjoying any benefits of leveraged investing. Therefore, when purchasing real estate with borrowed funds, careful calculations must be made beforehand to choose a suitable house price that does not jeopardize the family\u0026rsquo;s normal living expenses.\nAlthough the initial burden of a mortgage is heavy, it becomes lighter over time as work experience and salary increase. If you wait until you have saved enough money to buy a house, you might miss the opportunity entirely due to the rapid appreciation of house prices. Therefore, young people without real estate should consider buying a house as an investment. It not only forces them to save but also effectively combats inflation. Moreover, they can utilize the principle of financial leverage, using the bank\u0026rsquo;s money to expand their credit and accumulate wealth.\nHow Much Debt Should You Take On?\nIf you decide to use leveraged investing, the next question is: how much debt should you take on? This is a crucial question. Too much debt carries high risks, while too little debt fails to fully utilize the potential of making money with other people\u0026rsquo;s money.\nHow much debt should a family take on? Like \u0026ldquo;how much debt should a company have,\u0026rdquo; this is a question without a precise answer. In practice, it depends on the specific circumstances of each family. However, one thing is certain: if a family has the capacity to borrow but chooses not to, it is being too conservative and not managing its finances optimally. Conversely, excessive borrowing is too dangerous. Before taking on debt, each family should consider its actual situation and make a wise judgment about its debt level. As for how much to borrow, I recommend considering the following factors:\nIncome Stability: Loan interest must be paid on time regardless of investment performance. If your income source is unstable, you may not be able to make regular interest payments, making high-leverage investments unsuitable. Similar to companies with stable income, they have a greater capacity to utilize more debt. Personal Assets: Borrowing from financial institutions requires tangible assets as collateral. Therefore, owning more assets suitable as collateral allows for larger leveraged investments. Return on Investment: Other things being equal, the higher the return on investment, the greater the benefits of financial leverage. Inflation Rate: Borrowing is more advantageous during periods of high inflation, as inflation allows you to repay debt with less valuable money. Risk Tolerance: Everyone has a different risk tolerance, related to personality and individual circumstances. Those with low risk tolerance should not over-leverage, even if it could lead to large profits, as the stress could take a toll. Market Interest Rate Levels: Generally, when market interest rates fall and bank funds are ample, not only is it easier for investors to borrow money, but the benefits of financial leverage are also greater. Therefore, falling interest rates present an opportune time for investors to consider leveraged investing. Keeping money in the bank makes a person poor.\nThe Bank is Not a Place for Saving Money # What is the function of a bank to you? Many people believe banks are for saving money. However, for those who truly understand investment management, banks are not a place to save money, but a source of borrowing.\nThe function of a bank is to provide a place for those who are not good at managing money to save, so that those who are good at it can use that money to invest and make profits. Suppose someone deposits 14,000 per year into a bank at a 5% interest rate. After 40 years, the bank will owe this depositor 1.69 million. On the other hand, if an investor borrows 14,000 per year from the same bank at the same 5% interest rate and invests that money in stocks or real estate, achieving an average annual return of 20%, after 40 years, their investment would grow to 102.81 million, while they only need to repay the bank 1.69 million. In other words, the 101.12 million gained was made by utilizing the money of bank depositors.\nHow to Build Credit\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s highly developed financial markets, there are numerous financing channels for businesses. However, for individuals, banks remain the primary source of borrowing. Maintaining a close relationship with the bank and earning their trust is crucial for building personal credit.\nCredit is the ability to borrow. A person with high credit not only demonstrates a strong ability to repay loans but also indicates wealth. How do you build credit? As the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;Loan and repay, and borrowing again is easy.\u0026rdquo; The first rule of building credit is to borrow money and repay it on time. Some people, to establish their creditworthiness (the ability to borrow), even borrow small sums of money for seemingly frivolous reasons, just to build a good borrowing record so they can borrow larger amounts in the future.\nDiscard the outdated notion that \u0026ldquo;borrowing is not respectable.\u0026rdquo; In the past, only those in dire financial straits would borrow money. Nowadays, such individuals can at most borrow small amounts from relatives and friends. They would likely be unable to borrow a cent from a bank. Today, those who can borrow from banks are typically wealthy individuals.\nBased on current bank loan approval standards, without sufficient assets as collateral or evidence of stable future income and repayment ability, can anyone borrow money? Therefore, when I hear about someone heavily in debt, my first question is whether the source of the debt is banks or private loans. If the source is entirely from banks, my immediate thought is: \u0026ldquo;This person must be wealthy.\u0026rdquo;\nBorrowing: A Double-Edged Sword\nThose who don\u0026rsquo;t borrow cannot go bankrupt; similarly, those who don\u0026rsquo;t borrow can hardly become immensely wealthy in a short period. \u0026ldquo;Debt\u0026rdquo; appears in the lives of both the most successful and the most unsuccessful. While many wealthy individuals utilize debt to become rich, many poor people are ruined by misusing debt. Borrowing is a double-edged sword. Used correctly, it is a significant aid to investment and wealth creation. Used improperly, its destructive power can lead to complete ruin. Prudence is essential when using it. It\u0026rsquo;s like a double-edged sword that can save or harm, depending on how it\u0026rsquo;s wielded.\nI advise against rushing into leveraged investing before fully understanding its principles. First, understand the nature of leveraged investing and carefully consider whether to use borrowing for investment. Before borrowing, thoroughly understand how leveraged investing works. Only then can you truly achieve the goal of making money with other people\u0026rsquo;s money without harming yourself.\n","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005963/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law IV","type":"posts"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law V: Mitigating Investment Risk # Investment and financial management should never prioritize returns while neglecting risks.\nAnalyzing Risk, Minimizing Damage # In 1987, while working at Merrill Lynch in the United States, I met a seasoned investment veteran with decades of Wall Street experience. He once said, \u0026ldquo;I can teach you how to pick stocks in an hour, but it would take me more than five years to teach you how to manage investment risk.\u0026rdquo;\nRisk is Unavoidable\nIn the ever-changing and unpredictable world of investment, uncertainties abound. We call these uncertainties risks. How you face these risks when they materialize is a question every investor must confront. Risk is called risk precisely because future outcomes are uncertain and unavoidable. Therefore, investment and financial management should never solely focus on returns while ignoring risks. In fact, managing risk is even more crucial. The purpose of risk management is not to eliminate risk entirely, but to acknowledge its inherent existence and impossibility of complete eradication. It\u0026rsquo;s about analyzing risk and subsequently mitigating it.\nWhile engaging in risk management, investors must understand that \u0026ldquo;you can never be fully prepared for every risk.\u0026rdquo; You can strive to reduce risk, but don\u0026rsquo;t attempt to eliminate it completely. Many try to avoid risk through predictions or expert advice. However, no matter how accurate your forecasting techniques or how insightful the expert predictions, risk can never be fully avoided. The greatest danger of predictions is not their frequent inaccuracy, but the tendency for investors to blindly trust them, losing their risk awareness. They focus solely on whether the prediction comes true, neglecting the potential magnitude of the underlying risks. Relying solely on predictions without thorough risk analysis is extremely dangerous. Any sound investment decision inherently involves unknowns, uncertainties, and risks. Furthermore, investments without uncertainties and a degree of risk are unlikely to be good investments.\nAll High-Return Investments Carry High Risks\nThe key to successful investment and financial management lies in learning to grasp high returns while effectively managing the accompanying risks.\nThe investment environment is constantly changing and unpredictable. The only constant is change. Some external factors (such as interest rates, exchange rates, economic conditions, and inflation rates) are bound to change, although the nature of these changes remains unknown. Additionally, unforeseen events (such as wars, political events, and natural disasters) are uncontrollable variables. To succeed in this volatile investment world, the most important thing is not to lament change but to accept it as inevitable. Prepare for various changes and even anticipate them, because only through change can wealth be redistributed. Change is both a threat and an opportunity, depending on how you respond. Skilled investors often find profitable opportunities amidst change.\nPeople often assume investors love risk. This is not true. Successful investors possess a unique ability to manage risk. They don\u0026rsquo;t see \u0026ldquo;risk-taking\u0026rdquo; as a source of amusement, nor do they find the act of taking risks thrilling or exciting. They take risks solely for the potential of high investment returns. Since all high-return investments inherently carry high risks, risk-taking is an unavoidable part of the journey to financial success.\nMany perceive stock investment as extremely risky, believing stock investors to be risk-seekers. In reality, investing in stocks is not about loving the risk associated with stocks. It\u0026rsquo;s about understanding that all high-return investments carry high risks. To build wealth, you must take the risk of investing in high-return assets and bear the associated risks. Savvy investors understand how to take calculated risks and mitigate them. In fact, if risk mitigation measures are implemented effectively, the actual risks of investment and financial management are relatively small.\nStocks and real estate offer high returns precisely because of their inherent volatility and risk. Because most people are risk-averse and avoid investing in risky assets like stocks and real estate, those who can tolerate risk are better positioned to reap higher returns.\nMany shy away from stocks and real estate primarily because they fear losses, are intimidated by future uncertainties, or can\u0026rsquo;t handle price fluctuations. In fact, short-term price fluctuations are perfectly normal and highlight the high-risk nature of high-return investments. Therefore, to achieve high returns, one must possess a spirit of adventure and be able to withstand significant volatility.\n1. Unpredictable risks allow risk-takers to earn a risk premium.\n2. We miss opportunities because we are afraid to take risks, not because the world doesn\u0026rsquo;t offer them.\n3. To achieve financial success through investment, you must take risks, because high returns always come with high risks.\nI dislike taking unnecessary risks, so before every activity, I do my best to take necessary precautions to mitigate risk.\nThe Forbes Philosophy on Risk # Malcolm Forbes was a legendary figure in the American business world. He amassed a fortune by founding Forbes magazine, possessed a priceless collection, and was listed among the 400 wealthiest Americans. He not only ran a high-risk magazine business but was also a renowned hot air balloonist and motorcycle enthusiast. He once rode a motorcycle across Eurasia from Paris to Beijing. He traveled the world, flying hot air balloons across the United States, and even ventured to Turkey and China, setting multiple world records and attracting widespread media attention, making him a household name.\nAverting Danger Before it Happens, Ensuring Safety\nSome labeled him an \u0026ldquo;adventurer.\u0026rdquo; He offered an insightful explanation of this label, saying, \u0026ldquo;Many people think I\u0026rsquo;m a risk-lover. I\u0026rsquo;m not. Like most people, I strongly dislike risk. The reason I take risks today, despite my aversion to them, is simple: all good things in life come with risks. I take risks purely to live a rich and fulfilling life.” \u0026ldquo;Riding in a hot air balloon or on a motorcycle across different lands broadens one\u0026rsquo;s horizons and exposes one to the world\u0026rsquo;s beauty, enriching life. However, many people, despite yearning for these experiences, hesitate to engage in them because they perceive them as high-risk activities. But, once you actually try them, you\u0026rsquo;ll find that if you take adequate precautions beforehand, the risks involved are quite small.” \u0026ldquo;I dislike taking unnecessary risks, so before every activity, I strive to take the necessary preventative measures to mitigate risk.\u0026rdquo;\nMalcolm Forbes was risk-averse, but he took risks to experience the good things in life, and after taking those risks, he sought ways to mitigate them.\nAssess the Rewards and Risks, If It\u0026rsquo;s Worth It – Take the Risk\nAre you afraid of taking risks? If so, you are not alone. Most people are afraid of taking risks; very few are natural risk-takers. But why are some people so composed in the face of risk, and even achieve success through it? It\u0026rsquo;s because they understand the principles of \u0026ldquo;nothing ventured, nothing gained\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;no high risk, no high return.\u0026rdquo; Indeed, the correct perspective on risk should be: take risks worth taking, and then find ways to mitigate them.\nSuccessful investors are driven by the pursuit of \u0026ldquo;wealth.\u0026rdquo; Although they must be prepared to withstand the pressure of price fluctuations, as long as the expected return is high and there\u0026rsquo;s a risk premium, risk-taking will ultimately lead to success.\nBefore every investment, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to understand the potential risks and develop contingency plans for every possible scenario. Analyze the degree of blind risk-taking, estimate the probability of success, and continuously re-evaluate throughout the process. I recommend investors create a risk-reward assessment table before making any investment, weighing all factors. Ask yourself, \u0026ldquo;Can I bear the consequences if the worst-case scenario unfolds?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Is the potential return of this investment attractive enough?\u0026rdquo;\nAlways plan for the worst and prepare for the best. This is especially true for investment and financial management. Before making any investment, no matter how confident you are, you should ask yourself, \u0026ldquo;What is the worst possible outcome?\u0026rdquo; Then ask, \u0026ldquo;Can I bear the consequences if the worst happens?\u0026rdquo; If the answer to both questions is yes, and the expected return is high enough, then you should invest. If the worst-case scenario is unbearable, then no matter how alluring the potential reward, you should categorically refuse to invest.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Take Unnecessary Risks\nIf you ever visit Las Vegas or Atlantic City, observe the lavishly decorated casinos carefully. You\u0026rsquo;ll notice the absence of clocks and windows, and the ever-present bright lights. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no time in the mountains, and no time in casinos.\u0026rdquo; Why are there no clocks or windows in casinos? It\u0026rsquo;s because casinos leverage the law of large numbers to win your money. The lack of clocks and windows is designed to blur the lines between day and night, encouraging gamblers to play endlessly until they lose track of time. The longer you play, the more times you play, the higher the probability of the casino winning. As the number of games increases, the expected value gradually reveals itself. Gambling inevitably leads to losses because its expected value is negative. This might not be apparent in a few instances, but over time, the expected value becomes increasingly evident. Therefore, prolonged gambling inevitably leads to losses. This explains the saying \u0026ldquo;nine out of ten gamblers lose\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;long-term gambling leads to certain loss,\u0026rdquo; which aligns perfectly with the principle of the law of large numbers. The law of large numbers states that the more times a game is played, the closer the return gets to the expected value of that game.\nI had a classmate in the doctoral program at UC Berkeley who excelled in mathematics and frequented Las Vegas casinos on weekends. Curious, I asked him, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re so smart and you know that gambling is designed against the players. Are you trying to win money?\u0026rdquo; He replied, \u0026ldquo;I never go there to win money. I gamble to relieve stress.\u0026rdquo; He explained that after a heartbreak in college, he tried various methods to cope, such as drinking, speeding, and traveling, but none were effective. He eventually found that only gambling could allow him to truly escape. Gambling can be a form of entertainment, but it\u0026rsquo;s certainly not a way to make money. Its expected average return is lower than bank deposits, making it impossible to build wealth through such activities.\nMany people hold the misconception that \u0026ldquo;high risk always equates to high return.\u0026rdquo; This misunderstanding stems from a misinterpretation of the definition of \u0026ldquo;return.\u0026rdquo; High risk might indeed offer high potential returns, but this represents the maximum possible return, which has a very low probability. However, in the context of \u0026ldquo;high risk, high return,\u0026rdquo; the \u0026ldquo;return\u0026rdquo; refers to the expected return (long-term average return), not the maximum possible return. Indeed, gambling boasts incredibly high maximum potential returns, but its average, or expected, return is negative. Taking such risks is not only unprofitable but also detrimental.\nThere are No High-Return, Zero-Risk Investments\nSuccess requires risk-taking, but risk-taking doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee success. One must take calculated risks. A calculated risk is one that, on average, offers high returns over the long term.\nSome people\u0026rsquo;s problem isn\u0026rsquo;t a lack of risk-taking spirit but a tendency to take unnecessary risks. They don\u0026rsquo;t know what risks to take to achieve financial success. As detailed in previous chapters, the cornerstone of investment success is the power of compounding, which only works effectively with high returns. Over the long term, stocks and real estate are asset classes that offer high expected returns. Therefore, taking calculated risks means investing in assets with high expected returns and bravely bearing the associated risks.\nConsider a game where participants must pay $100. There\u0026rsquo;s a 99.9% chance of losing $100 and a 0.1% chance of winning $95,000. Would you play? In a survey I conducted with hundreds of students, over 65% chose to play this high-risk game. Their reasoning was simple: while the risk was high, the potential loss was capped at $100, while the potential gain was a whopping $95,000. However, the expected return of this game is negative. Even if you get lucky and win once, in the long run, you\u0026rsquo;re bound to lose. This is a classic example of a risk not worth taking.\nAvoid risks that don\u0026rsquo;t offer high returns. Activities like futures trading, margin trading in foreign exchange and bonds, lotteries, and short-term stock trading all carry high risks and often have negative returns. In other words, these are high-risk, negative-return activities. You can engage in these activities for entertainment, but never delude yourself into believing they will bring you wealth.\nThere are no high-return, zero-risk investment opportunities. In a society filled with intelligent individuals, such opportunities are impossible. If someone offers you a high-return, risk-free investment opportunity, they are undoubtedly trying to scam you.\nI remind readers again: don\u0026rsquo;t blindly chase high returns and jump into risky ventures. Speculative activities like those mentioned above are not truly high-return investment tools, but they are definitely high-risk endeavors. These risks are not worth taking.\nAbsolute safety is a myth. The real danger is not taking any risks. In a volatile environment, the biggest risk is not taking any risks.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Shy Away from Risk Entirely # The future world is changing rapidly. Changes will accelerate across all aspects of business, economics, finance, politics, and society, creating a more complex financial landscape. It\u0026rsquo;s foreseeable that wealth redistribution will also accelerate. Risk aversion is human nature. In the past, you could live a stable life without taking risks. However, in the face of the volatile investment environment of the future, not taking risks becomes the biggest risk of all.\nFear of Falling Will Keep You from Running Fast\nFear of risk prevents many from investing, causing them to miss out on the opportunity to build wealth. Keeping money in a bank seems safe and risk-free. However, as previously analyzed, inflation severely erodes the real value of money. From a financial management perspective, keeping money in a bank carries the greatest risk. Decades later, when those around you who invested wisely become millionaires, those who kept their money in banks may face financial hardship. My point is: don\u0026rsquo;t shy away from risk entirely. Risk isn\u0026rsquo;t as terrifying as it seems. Taking calculated risks with high potential returns is absolutely worthwhile.\nI\u0026rsquo;m often asked, \u0026ldquo;Teacher, will the stock market fall again?\u0026rdquo; My answer is, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; Then they ask, \u0026ldquo;When will it start rising?\u0026rdquo; My answer remains, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; They further inquire, \u0026ldquo;Which stock should I buy? Can you give me a hot tip?\u0026rdquo; My answer is still, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; Then they question skeptically, \u0026ldquo;How can you invest when you don\u0026rsquo;t know anything? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that too risky?\u0026rdquo; My response is, \u0026ldquo;You must invest and manage your finances without knowing the answers to these questions to succeed.\u0026rdquo;\nWhy invest when the answers are unknown and the future is uncertain? The reason is simple: While the future is full of risks, one thing is certain: as long as the economy continues to grow and corporate profitability rises, the long-term return on investment in the stock market will inevitably surpass bank deposits, and by a significant margin. Repeatedly avoiding worthwhile risks will prevent you from building wealth.\nHow to Cultivate a Risk-Taking Spirit\nA courageous risk-taker is not someone without fear, but someone with the power to overcome it.\nThe spirit of adventure isn\u0026rsquo;t innate; it\u0026rsquo;s developed through practice, through taking risks, failing, taking risks again, failing again… step by step.\nEveryone is capable of taking risks, and everyone has had the experience of taking bold risks. As toddlers, we dared to stand and learn to walk, falling and getting back up countless times. Learning to ride a bicycle involved numerous falls, followed by getting back up, falling again, and getting back up again, until we finally mastered it. Most life skills, such as swimming, skating, driving, public speaking, and so on, are not innate instincts. Learning these skills requires going through a phase of risk-taking, embracing the spirit of perseverance, and trying repeatedly. Learning investment and financial management is no exception; it requires this standard process of risk-taking. To become a successful investor, you must first discard the habit of risk aversion, rediscover your lost instinct for adventure, and cultivate a healthy risk-taking spirit.\nDoes investing have to be extremely risky? In reality, the risks involved in investment and financial management are no greater than the examples mentioned above. It\u0026rsquo;s just that as we reach an age where we believe we are qualified to manage finances, our risk-taking spirit has diminished significantly. As children, almost everyone learns to walk. A little older, most learn to ride a bicycle. But as we grow older, the number of people who learn more adventurous activities like swimming and skating decreases considerably. In adulthood, the number of people comfortable with public speaking dwindles even further.\nOur risk-taking spirit seems to fade with age. This is partly because experiencing failures and mistakes naturally leads to frustration and discouragement. Without sufficient motivation, we tend to avoid taking risks to minimize the blow of failure. Another contributing factor is traditional education. Out of a desire to protect children, adults often reprimand them for any risky behavior, instilling a habit of prioritizing safety and avoiding mistakes. Children then strive to be \u0026ldquo;good kids\u0026rdquo; who never do anything wrong. As we age, this risk aversion becomes ingrained. While avoiding risk isn\u0026rsquo;t inherently bad, excessive risk aversion becomes a significant obstacle to successful investment and financial management.\nThe First Priority of Financial Management: Overcoming Fear\nWhen individuals can control their fear, they can control their thoughts and actions. Self-control enables them to remain calm in chaotic environments, make necessary decisions without being paralyzed by the uncertainty of the outcomes, and be prepared to bear the consequences of failure when things don\u0026rsquo;t go as planned. This courage and risk-taking spirit in the face of danger are essential qualities for investors.\nCourageous risk-takers are not fearless; they simply recognize risk and overcome their fear of it. Courage stems from controlling fear, and cultivating a risk-taking spirit begins with understanding risk.\nTo become a successful investor, you must first discard the habit of avoiding risk. Admittedly, changing long-held risk-averse habits is no easy feat. However, since risk-taking is an indispensable element of successful financial management, the first priority in learning to manage your finances is to overcome fear and force yourself to take risks. Cultivate a healthy risk-taking spirit, invest bravely in assets with high expected returns, and bear the associated risks.\nTop performers in any field achieve success by bravely facing their fears and taking calculated risks. Those who achieve financial success and fulfill their dreams through investment share this same spirit of adventure. Remember: excessive caution hinders success. Without a spirit of adventure, dreams will forever remain dreams.\nMastering risk is the foundation of successful financial management.\nOvercoming Risk – Start Small # Skilled risk-takers never test the depth of the water by stepping in with both feet. They extend one foot first, and if the situation seems unfavorable, they quickly withdraw. An African proverb states, \u0026ldquo;Only a fool tests the depth of the water with both feet.\u0026rdquo; Similarly, only a fool would go all-in without any investment experience.\nGain Experience with Small Amounts of Money\nWhen faced with unfamiliar investment opportunities, don\u0026rsquo;t put all your eggs in one basket. Start small. Skilled generals don\u0026rsquo;t expose their main forces to unnecessary danger. To gather intelligence and gain an advantage, they deploy small reconnaissance units deep into enemy territory to identify low-risk, high-impact attack strategies.\nThe same principle applies to investment risk-taking strategies. When dealing with unfamiliar investments, unclear situations, or a lack of confidence, avoid going all-in. Start small, using small amounts of money to gain experience and familiarize yourself with the situation. Once you have sufficient experience and confidence, then you can invest larger sums.\nAs the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;All things are difficult before they are easy.\u0026rdquo; The best way to overcome fear is to confront what you fear head-on. Since risk-taking is an essential part of building wealth through investment, don\u0026rsquo;t shy away from it. Start with small investments to build your risk tolerance. With experience, the feeling of fear will gradually dissipate. By progressively overcoming small fears, you can then face larger risks. You\u0026rsquo;ll soon discover that the experience gained through risk-taking is helping you steadily approach your dreams.\nOnce You\u0026rsquo;re Used to Risk, You\u0026rsquo;ll Find It\u0026rsquo;s Not So Scary\nRisk aversion is human nature, but don\u0026rsquo;t let a single investment failure shatter your confidence and prevent you from investing again, turning you into a perpetual loser. Conversely, don\u0026rsquo;t let a stroke of good luck make you forget the existence of risk, leading you to borrow heavily and invest recklessly, resulting in irreparable losses. Successful and unsuccessful investors alike fear risk; they simply react to it differently.\nDear readers, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t tried investing yet, take the plunge for the sake of building wealth! If you take appropriate risk mitigation measures after investing, I can assure you from experience: \u0026ldquo;The risks of investing are actually quite small, even smaller than the risk of riding a bicycle. After 10 or 20 years of investing, when you see your wealth growing rapidly, the feeling will be hundreds of times better than riding a bicycle.\u0026rdquo;\nThe first element of investing is a strong adventurous spirit, seeking to generate substantial risk premiums between risk and safety. No matter what investment you choose, as long as it offers high expected returns, risk is inevitable. Investors should embrace calculated risks and accumulate financial knowledge and experience along the way. Risk naturally decreases with accumulated knowledge, and wealth grows at an increasing pace.\nThis book dedicates significant space to discussing risk because the biggest challenge people face in financial management is their inability to confront risk directly. They don\u0026rsquo;t know how to face or manage risk, and some are even afraid to take any risks. They don\u0026rsquo;t realize that the biggest obstacle to successful investment and financial management is the fear of risk. This mindset is understandable, as most investment and financial management decisions are made amidst uncertainty and change. In short, to achieve financial success through investment, you must be willing to take calculated risks. Currently, many people suffer significant losses due to blind risk-taking and involvement in high-risk speculative activities.\nIf you are unwilling to take risks and prefer a conservative approach, be prepared for a life of mediocrity, as this is unavoidable. Of course, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with a conservative and mediocre life if it brings you happiness. The choice is yours. People usually regret the things they didn\u0026rsquo;t do, not the things they tried. Therefore, my advice is: Take risks, but be cautious and learn how to manage them.\n","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005964/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law V","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/return/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Return","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/risk-premium/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Risk Premium","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/risk-taking/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Risk-Taking","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-10","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E4%BF%A1%E7%94%A8/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"信用","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-10","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%86%92%E9%99%A9%E7%B2%BE%E7%A5%9E/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"冒险精神","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-10","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%8A%A5%E9%85%AC/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"报酬","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-10","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E8%B4%B7%E6%AC%BE/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"贷款","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-10","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E9%A3%8E%E9%99%A9%E6%BA%A2%E4%BB%B7/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"风险溢价","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/entrepreneurship/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Entrepreneurship","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/financial-concepts/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Financial Concepts","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/patience/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Patience","type":"tags"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law II: Patience is Key to Wealth Accumulation # Working hard is not about making more money,\nbut about maintaining a state of mind\n— challenge, goals, struggle, and success.\nHow Did Li Ka-shing Accumulate His Wealth? # Li Ka-shing, ranked among the top ten wealthiest Chinese in the world with a fortune of nearly $7 billion, is the chairman of Cheung Kong Holdings and Hutchison Whampoa Limited in Hong Kong. His legendary journey to wealth and his influence in Hong Kong\u0026rsquo;s political and business circles have earned him another nickname — \u0026ldquo;Superman Li.\u0026rdquo;\nCapitalizing on the Plunging Property Market\nIn 1939, 12-year-old Li Ka-shing moved to Hong Kong from his hometown of Chao\u0026rsquo;an, Guangdong, with his father. After two years of schooling, Hong Kong fell due to the Pacific War. The following year, his father died of a serious illness, forcing Li Ka-shing, the eldest son, to drop out of school and support his family. After Hong Kong\u0026rsquo;s liberation in 1945, he ended his odd-job career and became a salesman at a plastics factory, working over 16 hours a day. Three years later, at the age of 20, he was promoted to general manager. Two years after that, he used all his savings of HK$7,000 to start his own small plastics factory, \u0026ldquo;Cheung Kong Industries,\u0026rdquo; the predecessor of today\u0026rsquo;s largest conglomerate in Hong Kong, Cheung Kong Holdings.\nHow did Li Ka-shing, without even a primary school diploma, take his first step toward becoming the richest man by producing plastic flowers? In 1958, due to a rent increase by the landlord of his factory, Li Ka-shing bought a piece of land in North Point and built his own factory. In the early 1960s, the plastic flower industry declined, and in 1967, Hong Kong property prices plummeted. Li Ka-shing seized the opportunity to acquire land at low prices. In 1972, the Hong Kong stock market soared, and Cheung Kong Industries went public, taking advantage of the opportunity to raise capital from the public to purchase more land. In the 10 years following the completion of his first factory in 1958, his real estate holdings increased 50-fold. Cheung Kong now holds approximately 1.48 million square meters of floor space. Li Ka-shing has been investing in real estate for over 40 years, and long-term investment has accumulated his enormous wealth.\nHaving strived for 50 years and achieved success in wealth accumulation, Li Ka-shing has unique insights into success. He said: \u0026ldquo;Before the age of 20, 100% of career success comes from hard work; between 20 and 30, when a career has some foundation, 10% of success depends on good luck, and 90% still comes from diligence; after 30, the proportion of opportunity gradually increases; now, luck accounts for about 30% to 40%.\u0026rdquo;\nThe same applies to wealth accumulation. Before 20, all money comes from hard work; between 20 and 30 is the time to work hard to earn and save money; after 30, the importance of investment and financial management gradually increases. By middle age, the money earned is less important, and how to manage money becomes more critical. Li Ka-shing has been fighting for his wealth all his life. To become rich, one must have enough patience.\nThe Power of Compound Interest Takes Time\nMany people who have heard my lectures often ask the same questions: \u0026ldquo;Saving 14,000 yuan a year to become a billionaire is indeed impressive, but according to your method, it takes 40 years, which is really discouraging!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;It takes 40 years to become a billionaire. By then, I might be dead. What\u0026rsquo;s the point of having billions then?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Can you teach some secrets to getting rich quickly?\u0026rdquo;\nEven I feel that 40 years is too long. At the repeated requests of the audience, I did spend some time studying this issue in depth. The result of the research is: Financial management requires a long time, and the effect is not visible in the short term. It is impossible to get rich quickly through financial management.\nIf someone starts now and saves 14,000 yuan at the end of each year, and if the money saved each year can be invested in stocks or real estate with an average annual return of 20%, we know that the wealth will grow to 102.81 million yuan after 40 years. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s ask: How much wealth can he accumulate after 10 years? Most people think that with such a high return, even with a shorter time, after 10 years of compounding, it should be at least 5 million yuan, some even guess 10 million, and the most conservative guess is 1 million. Similarly, this is a surprising answer: 360,000 yuan! The following calculation formula should be familiar to readers, but they will be surprised that the amount is so small.\n14,000×(1+0.20)10−10.20=360,00014,000×(1+0.20)40−10.20=102,810,000\nWith the same 20% return, 14,000 yuan per year results in 102.81 million yuan after 40 years of financial management, but only 360,000 yuan after 10 years, which is unbelievable! The difference is more than 300 times! Fortunately, this concept is presented to readers in a timely manner. Otherwise, if readers use the methods mentioned in this book, save 14,000 yuan every year, and invest all of it in stocks, thinking that they can become billionaires, they would be shocked to find that after ten years of hard work, with an average annual return of 20%, they have only accumulated 360,000 yuan! They might feel cheated. After struggling for 10 years, they can\u0026rsquo;t even afford a car, let alone become billionaires!\nWhat is 10 years? Ten years is a long time. After 10 years of struggle, there\u0026rsquo;s only a little over 300,000 yuan. How discouraging! This is the frustration one inevitably encounters in the process of accumulating wealth through investment and financial management. Investors must understand that financial management is a \u0026ldquo;marathon\u0026rdquo; rather than a \u0026ldquo;sprint.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s about endurance, not explosive power.\nThe prerequisite for getting rich through investment and financial management is time, and a long time. You must go through a very long waiting period before you can see the results. If the invested capital is small, no results will be seen after 10 years.\nEarning Your Second 10 Million is Easier Than the First 1 Million\nSaving 14,000 yuan at the end of each year with an average investment return of 20%, even after 20 years, the assets will only accumulate to 2.61 million yuan. At this point, one is still far from being a billionaire. It takes 30 years to accumulate 16.55 million yuan, barely reaching the millionaire level. Only after 40 years of continuous struggle can one become a billionaire with 102.81 million yuan.\nAnnual Investment of 14,000 Yuan, Wealth Accumulation (20% Return, Unit/10,000 Yuan)\nYear Accumulated Amount at Year End Amount Increased in the Last Five Years 5 10 10 10 36 26 15 101 65 20 261 160 25 661 400 30 1655 994 35 4128 2473 40 10281 6153 From the table above, we can see: by saving 14,000 yuan annually with a 20% investment return, the wealth increased by 360,000 yuan in the first decade, 2.25 million yuan in the second decade, 13.94 million yuan in the third decade, and 86.26 million yuan in the fourth decade. This is the characteristic of geometric progression, and it is also the principle that people engaged in investment and financial management should understand. Therefore, three important characteristics of investment and financial management can be summarized here:\nMost wealth is created in the later stages. From the above example, we can see that only 41.28 million yuan was accumulated in the first 35 years, while 61.53 million yuan was created in the last 5 years. In terms of amount, your ability to make money through financial management increases over time. From the table above, it can be seen that doing the same thing, the amount of money earned increases, the only thing needed is patience. Earning the second 10 million yuan is often easier than the first 1 million yuan. Wealth accumulation doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen overnight.\nPatience Pays Off # A self-made man who got rich by investing in stocks once told me: \u0026ldquo;Now that I\u0026rsquo;ve made it, a stock price increase can easily bring in millions of yuan. Making money has suddenly become so easy, it\u0026rsquo;s unstoppable. Thinking back to the days when I first entered the stock market 30 years ago, it took a lot of hard work to earn tens of thousands of yuan. I really don\u0026rsquo;t know where the money went back then.\u0026rdquo;\nThis experience is not unfamiliar to many who have struggled to build their fortunes from scratch. Everything is difficult at the beginning. During the initial struggle, money is hard to earn. It takes a lot of effort to earn just tens of thousands of yuan. It\u0026rsquo;s puzzling why money is so hard to earn. Until success is achieved, and money comes rolling in, one wonders why making money has become so easy.\nTime is the Stepping Stone to Wealth Accumulation\nEveryone desires the ability to effortlessly earn their second million or ten million, reaching a state of abundant wealth. The problem is, before earning the second million, you need to have the first million. But how can you earn the first million? If you want to accumulate 1 million through investment and financial management, you need \u0026ldquo;time.\u0026rdquo; You have to go through a long period of hardship. If you can endure the difficult period of earning the first million, you can naturally enjoy the ease of earning the second million.\nFrom the compound interest formula, we can see that time is an indispensable factor for compound interest to take effect. Patient waiting is a prerequisite for investment and financial management. Especially for wealth accumulation through financial management, the required patience is not a few months or years, but at least two or three decades, or even four or five decades.\nThe vast majority of wealthy people accumulate their huge fortunes gradually from small amounts of money over a long period. In the beginning, most people have very little capital, even negligible. However, success is woven from a series of small achievements. Great wealth is the accumulation of small wealth, coupled with the effect of compound interest.\nThe importance of time in investment and financial management is evident. Patience is essential for financial management. The more patient you are in enduring the long waiting period, the greater the power of wealth creation will be. This is the characteristic of \u0026ldquo;compound interest.\u0026rdquo; However, today we live in a \u0026ldquo;fast food\u0026rdquo; culture where everything emphasizes speed and efficiency: fast food restaurants for meals, express delivery for mail, highways for driving, one-hour photo processing, and crash courses for learning. People have become increasingly impatient and short-sighted, lacking patience. In investment and financial management, they are also impatient and lack patience, wanting to see results immediately. It may be more efficient to pursue speed in other matters, but investment and financial management cannot be rushed. Time is a necessary condition for financial management. The more you rush, the less you achieve. Based on my observations, a common mistake among investors is giving up halfway. They get easily discouraged during bear markets and simply sell their stocks and real estate, completely leaving the stock and property markets, not knowing that lack of patience and perseverance makes it difficult to achieve anything.\nTime is an indispensable factor in achieving wealth through financial management. The patience required for wealth accumulation is not a few months or years, but at least two or three decades. Patient waiting allows compound interest to take effect. How can investors achieve a state of abundant and unstoppable wealth? Long-term holding and patient waiting. The Real Estate Investment Experience of Madam Chang Yao-Hung-Ying, Chairperson of Grand Pacific Construction\n\u0026ldquo;Land I bought for hundreds of thousands in the past is now worth hundreds of millions.\u0026rdquo;\nMadam Chang Yao-Hung-Ying, chairperson of Grand Pacific Construction, pointed out: In the 1930s, a mainlander investing in land in Taiwan was often ridiculed. But it was with this small capital and perseverance that Madam Chang Yao-Hung-Ying, who left Shanghai for Taiwan in 1947, when her husband became disillusioned with his business, saw the development potential of Taiwan. She picked up their real estate business skills from Shanghai and started buying land.\nAfter more than 40 years, her long-term investment in real estate finally paid off. Her family\u0026rsquo;s business is growing bigger and bigger, and they now own two listed companies: ASE Technology Holding and Grand Pacific Construction. ASE Technology Holding is now the second largest packaging factory in the world. As for Grand Pacific Construction, it launched the Earl\u0026rsquo;s Court project in Xizhi in 1987, which boosted the real estate market in Xizhi and rapidly accumulated their family\u0026rsquo;s wealth, making them one of the richest families in Taiwan.\nMadam Chang Yao-Hung-Ying has now passed the baton to her son, Jason Chang. Jason Chang, chairman of ASE Technology Holding, seems to have inherited his mother\u0026rsquo;s investment acumen. He\u0026rsquo;s the kind of person who buys land wherever he goes, whether it\u0026rsquo;s in Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China, or the United States. Perhaps in another two or three decades, Jason Chang will also say: \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect that the land I bought for a few million back then would now be worth tens of billions.\u0026rdquo; However, Jason Chang\u0026rsquo;s wealth accumulation speed will be much faster than his mother\u0026rsquo;s because he has already laid a good foundation. All he needs to do is go with the flow, and his wealth will increase geometrically, with money rolling in, unstoppable.\nWithstanding the Test of Time is the True Measure\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not your judgment that makes you a lot of money, but your patience.\nA crucial factor in financial management is time. Without a correct understanding of it, impatience will naturally arise. Impatience leads to taking significant risks, turning potential success into failure.\nWhether it\u0026rsquo;s the accumulation of wealth or experience, it\u0026rsquo;s not something that can be accomplished overnight. It takes time. Fortunately, God is very fair in this regard. Regardless of whether one is born rich or poor, noble or humble, everyone has only 24 hours a day and an average lifespan of about 75 years. Time is the greatest wealth in life, and a person\u0026rsquo;s honor, status, wealth, and happiness all depend on how they use this wealth.\nTo accumulate wealth through investment and financial management, time is an indispensable factor. It cannot be rushed. Investment and financial management can lead to slow and steady wealth accumulation, but investing small amounts of money and wanting to earn billions of wealth in a short period is, I can say with certainty, \u0026ldquo;impossible!\u0026rdquo; Just imagine, can a mother give birth without going through ten months of pregnancy? Can a farmer shorten the growth period of rice seedlings?\nThe growth of wealth is like the growth of life. It\u0026rsquo;s formed bit by bit, day by day, month by month, year by year, under the effect of compound interest. It cannot be achieved overnight. This is the law of nature, and God never changes his natural laws.\nLuck is Not a Long-Term Strategy\nMany investors make a fortune overnight and go bankrupt overnight. Their success is due to luck, and their failure is because \u0026ldquo;you may be lucky for a while, but you cannot always be lucky.\u0026rdquo; Any investment opportunity that promises overnight riches must hide a greater risk of overnight poverty. This is why most of those who fantasize about getting rich quickly through financial management end up losing everything.\nAs long as you are patient and invest your assets in the right investment vehicles, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to actively manage or worry. Compound interest will naturally lead to wealth growth, and becoming a billionaire over time is almost a certainty. In investment and financial management, haste makes waste. \u0026ldquo;Fast\u0026rdquo; is definitely not good!\nIf you really want to get rich quickly, I suggest you try entrepreneurship instead of investment and financial management. If any of the readers want to get rich quickly, what should they do? My sincere suggestion is to choose the path of entrepreneurship. I have studied the wealth accumulation process of many rich people throughout history and found that there are many examples of getting rich quickly through entrepreneurship. Bill Gates, the richest man in the United States, dropped out of college in his freshman year to found Microsoft and became the richest man in the United States in just 20 years.\nHowever, the probability of success in getting rich through entrepreneurship is extremely low. According to statistics from the Taiwan Entrepreneurship Association, the success rate of a person\u0026rsquo;s first business venture is only about 7%, and entrepreneurial success does not necessarily mean getting rich. In other words, for every successful entrepreneur we see, there are at least dozens of unknown failures behind them. Moreover, the entrepreneurial process is very arduous. Working more than ten hours a day seems to be a prerequisite for successful entrepreneurs.\nOn the contrary, as long as the method is correct, investing money in the stock market and property market, and waiting patiently for decades, the probability of getting rich through investment and financial management is very high. It\u0026rsquo;s hard not to get rich, and the process is relatively easy and enjoyable! Which method you choose to get rich is up to you. I must emphasize again that there is a possibility of getting rich quickly through entrepreneurship, but it is absolutely impossible to get rich quickly through financial management.\n","date":"9 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005961/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law II","type":"posts"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law III: Invest Sooner Rather Than Later # Invest first, then wait for the opportunity,\nrather than waiting for the opportunity to invest.\nProcrastination: The Primary Cause of Financial Failure # The mentality of \u0026ldquo;things will work out\u0026rdquo; and a passive approach to financial management is the most common obstacle to personal finance. It\u0026rsquo;s also the main reason why many people struggle to achieve financial independence by retirement. Many individuals adopt a passive attitude towards financial planning, believing that things will naturally fall into place. As they age and witness the rapid growth of others\u0026rsquo; wealth, they finally realize the importance of financial management. However, by then, time is often limited, the power of compound interest cannot be fully utilized, and it becomes too late, even if they understand the principles of financial management.\nFinancial Management Is Not Just for the Middle-Aged\nMany young people believe that financial management is something for middle-aged or wealthy individuals, and that it\u0026rsquo;s not too late to worry about it in old age. Here, I want to remind readers that the ability to build wealth through financial management has little correlation with the amount of money one possesses, but a significant correlation with the length of time invested. People often reach middle age, facing retirement with some savings, and only then start thinking about preparing for their financial future. However, at this point, it\u0026rsquo;s often too late. The reason is insufficient time to allow compound interest to work its magic. Turning small amounts of money into substantial wealth requires at least two to three decades. Recall the previous example: 10 years is not enough time to see significant growth. A much longer period is needed for remarkable results.\nSince we know that building wealth through investment requires investing in high-return assets and leveraging the long-term effects of compound interest, our approach, besides enriching our investment knowledge and skills, should involve immediate action. Financial planning should start as early as possible, cultivating patience and a long-term perspective.\nThe reason for many financial failures today is the lack of knowledge about how to utilize funds effectively to achieve the goal of making money work for you and building wealth through investment. This is a flaw in our education system. Schools dedicate significant time to teaching students how to earn a living but fail to teach them how to manage their earnings. College students exploring financial management through stock investment are often viewed as engaging in speculative and greedy behavior. In a future dominated by finance, the lack of proper financial knowledge not only erodes the dream of wealth accumulation but also harms the financial operations of businesses and the overall prosperity of society.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t delay your financial plan using the excuse of uncertain future price trends. Who can predict when real estate or stock prices will rise? Past price surges always lead to regret for those who missed out. There are no clear signs before prices start to rise, and no one will announce it with fanfare. For investments that are unpredictable in the short term but offer high expected returns in the long term, the safest strategy is to invest first and then wait for the opportunity, not the other way around.\nWarren Buffett Started Investing at Age 11\nI believe every business school graduate should sign a contract pledging to make no more than 20 major decisions in their lifetime. If your career spans 40 years, that\u0026rsquo;s one decision every two years.\nWarren Buffett, ranked the second richest man in America by Forbes magazine in 1996, is widely regarded as the god of stock investment. He claims that more than half of his net worth is attributed to about ten investment decisions. He believes the key to investment is to buy stocks of good companies at good prices and hold them for the long term. As long as these companies continue to perform well, don\u0026rsquo;t sell their stocks.\nBuffett, with a net worth of $9 billion, amassed his fortune entirely from the stock market. At 68, he held an MBA from Columbia University and was the son of a stockbroker-turned-congressman. Buffett made his first investment at the age of 11, putting his and his sister\u0026rsquo;s small savings into the stock market. Initially, he lost money, and his sister criticized him, but he insisted that it would take three to four years to see profits. His sister sold her shares, while he held on, ultimately proving his point.\nAt 20, while studying at Columbia University, Buffett immersed himself in finance books and insurance industry statistics while his peers focused on leisure activities. Lacking capital and disliking borrowing, he often sold stocks prematurely to reinvest in others. Despite the limitations of his funds, his wealth continued to grow.\nIn 1954, he joined Professor Graham\u0026rsquo;s investment firm. Two years later, he raised $100,000 from family and friends and established his own firm. After its assets increased thirtyfold, he dissolved the company in 1969, returned the partners\u0026rsquo; money, and focused on his own investments.\nHe is a true stock market tycoon and has been America\u0026rsquo;s richest man for years. Other wealthy Americans, like Bill Gates and Henry Lea Hillman, built their fortunes through businesses, while Buffett focused on stock investment. As long as the US economy continues to grow, his wealth will continue to increase.\nBuffett\u0026rsquo;s immense wealth, accumulated through nearly 60 years of investing, is a testament to the power of compound interest. His early experiences with trial and error played a crucial role in honing his investment acumen.\nFinancial management is like farming.\nA bountiful harvest in the future depends on diligent sowing and watering today.\nStart Investing Today # If time is an indispensable element of financial management, the best strategy is to act now. Start managing your finances today!\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Wait Until Your Hair Turns White\nThe earlier you start investing, the sooner you\u0026rsquo;ll achieve your financial goals and enjoy the fruits of your labor with your family. Furthermore, starting early maximizes the time for compound interest to work, requiring smaller initial investments and making financial management easier and more enjoyable.\nStarting later requires significantly higher monthly investments to reach the same goals. The following table is based on these assumptions: an annual return of 15%, a target amount of 100 million yuan, and a retirement age of 65. It calculates the required monthly investment for different starting ages.\nMonthly Investment Required to Become a Millionaire, by Starting Age\nStarting Age Monthly Investment (Yuan) 20 2324 25 4684 30 9458 35 19863 40 39163 45 81348 50 175143 55 410428 60 1235959 The table clearly demonstrates that youth is a valuable asset in wealth accumulation. The younger you are, the better positioned you are to achieve the dream of building wealth from small investments. Starting financial planning in old age requires monthly investments that are beyond the reach of most people. In short, start saving for retirement early. Don\u0026rsquo;t wait until your hair turns white; time waits for no one.\nYour future financial well-being depends on your actions today. Don\u0026rsquo;t let hesitation hold you back. Follow the principles outlined in this book, invest your funds in the stock market, real estate, or other high-return investment vehicles, and over time, you too can become wealthy.\n1. The earlier you start investing, the longer the time for compound interest to work, and the sooner you\u0026rsquo;ll achieve your wealth goals.\n2. Only young people can dream of building wealth from small investments.\n3. The best time to start managing your finances is as early as possible.\nJeffrey Koo Jr.\u0026rsquo;s Path to Wealth\nJeffrey Koo Jr., the eldest son of Jeffrey Koo Sr., chairman of Chinatrust Commercial Bank in Taiwan, and current Vice President of Chinatrust, is actively uniting the third generation of Taiwanese entrepreneurs. He organized a luncheon club primarily for the third generation of prominent Taiwanese business families to network and exchange information. To expand its influence, Koo Jr. has also strengthened the luncheon club\u0026rsquo;s connections with Southeast Asian politicians and the second and third generations of overseas Chinese business families.\nKoo Jr. is a representative figure among Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s third-generation entrepreneurs and the heir apparent to his father. Many assume his wealthy background afforded him a comfortable financial situation. However, Koo Sr. instilled frugal habits in his children and didn\u0026rsquo;t provide excessive allowances. Koo Jr. had to find his own ways to become financially independent.\nSent to Japan for his education by his father, Koo Jr. returned to Taiwan for university after graduating high school with only his accumulated New Year\u0026rsquo;s money, around NT$100,000, in his bank account. In early 1987, as the weighted stock price index climbed from 1,000 points, many people invested in the stock market. Koo Jr., then a junior in college, followed suit, investing all his savings. His grandmother\u0026rsquo;s daily routine of asking him to recite the stock market index further influenced him. His frequent interactions with entrepreneurs from various industries provided him with business opportunities, enabling him to grow his NT$100,000 capital to NT$10 million during the bull market.\nWhen the stock market crashed from over 10,000 points in 1990, he was already pursuing his Master\u0026rsquo;s degree at the Wharton School of Business in the US. His father, hoping for him to join the family business sooner, disapproved of his overseas studies and threatened to withhold financial support. Koo Jr. confidently assured his father that he could support himself financially. He successfully completed his studies in the US and even bought his dream car, a Porsche, with his own money. Koo Jr.\u0026rsquo;s knack for investment and financial management from a young age made his dreams a reality. If you aspire to be wealthy, start now!\nYouth Is the Greatest Asset for Financial Success\nSuccessful people have a habit: they delay, but don\u0026rsquo;t give up, the enjoyment of the fruits of their labor.\nIn Louis Cha\u0026rsquo;s novel The Book and the Sword, the Qianlong Emperor tells his sworn brother, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t envy anything about you except your youth.\u0026rdquo; Even the emperor envied youth.\nSimilarly, from a financial perspective, youth is the most important asset. I often tell college students, \u0026ldquo;Young people, your name is wealth!\u0026rdquo; The compound interest formula clearly shows that time is money, and youth is wealth.\nThe compound interest chart provides a clear roadmap for financial planning: focus on increasing income and saving during your youth and start investing early. Money saved during youth contributes significantly to wealth in old age. NT$10,000 saved in your youth can grow to over NT$2.3 million in 30 years. The same amount saved in old age will only grow to NT$60,000 in 10 years. Whether the statement \u0026ldquo;Young people, your name is wealth\u0026rdquo; becomes a reality depends on whether young people manage their finances wisely. Poor financial management, even with the advantage of youth, will not bring wealth.\nThe prevalent notion among young people today is that it\u0026rsquo;s fine to indulge in enjoyment while young and worry about financial planning later. This is a misguided perspective. Many young people believe retirement is far off and their funds are limited, so there\u0026rsquo;s no need to consider investment. They often miss the opportunity to start early.\nIn reality, starting financial planning in old age, even with some savings, is often too late due to limited time. The correct approach is: investing and managing finances is the job of young people, while managing wealth is the job of old age. However, many young people prioritize immediate gratification, spending their money on sports cars, high-end audio systems, or travel, believing they can enjoy life now and worry about finances later.\nIf you understand the role of time in financial management, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see why such individuals are destined for mediocrity. Countless examples in society demonstrate how prioritizing enjoyment in youth leads to poverty in old age. The key is their neglect of the importance of early financial planning. By the time they realize it, it\u0026rsquo;s often too late.\nAs Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s population ages and smaller family structures become the norm, future generations will rely on their own financial resources for living expenses. Therefore, the concept of starting financial planning in youth becomes increasingly critical.\nYouth Is the Best Time for Taking Risks\nYoung people possess the most valuable asset in financial management - time. Youth is also the best time to take risks because family responsibilities are generally lighter. Young people should embrace a risk-taking mindset because the cost of failure is lower. You can recover from setbacks more easily. Moreover, with limited funds, potential losses are smaller, providing valuable learning experiences. Most importantly, young people have ample time for compound interest to work its magic.\nBefore 50, one shouldn\u0026rsquo;t adopt an overly conservative approach to investment and financial management. The best time to learn about financial management is as early as possible. Sound financial judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from mistakes. Since developing good judgment requires making some mistakes along the way, why not gain this experience while you\u0026rsquo;re young and the stakes are lower? By the time you have more capital, you can apply your honed financial judgment effectively.\nYoung people should not just spend money but also understand the importance of saving. Start saving, and once you have a few thousand or tens of thousands of yuan, consider long-term, high-return investments, even if they carry some risk.\nSome may feel they are no longer young and their current income is low, leaving no surplus for investment. Indeed, older individuals have less time to benefit from compound interest. However, don\u0026rsquo;t be discouraged. Money can buy time, and you might still have opportunities to catch up. By following sound financial principles, you can achieve unexpected gains. If you are past 50, help your children by sharing these fundamental wealth-building concepts so they don\u0026rsquo;t miss out on the opportunity to build wealth early in their lives. Instead of giving your next generation money, teach them the knowledge of making money work for them.\n1. Youth is the greatest asset for building wealth through financial management. 2. Young people should embrace risk-taking because the cost of failure is lower. 3. Invest when you\u0026rsquo;re young to maximize the benefits of compound interest over time.\nPlaying a good hand well is nothing special; playing a bad hand well is what deserves admiration.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Neglect Financial Management Due to Limited Funds # Some believe that financial management is exclusive to the wealthy and high-income families, requiring substantial capital to even consider it. Indeed, financial management is about making money work for you. It\u0026rsquo;s not about turning stone into gold or creating something from nothing, so you need some initial capital. However, what many don\u0026rsquo;t realize is that the most influential factors on future wealth, according to the compound interest formula, are the rate of return and the length of the investment period, not the current amount of capital or future contributions.\nSmall Beginnings Can Lead to Great Fortunes\nWith the right approach, even a small amount of money can generate significant wealth over time, as illustrated in previous examples. Even someone with no initial capital, by investing 14,000 yuan annually, can become a millionaire in 40 years. The principle of investment and financial management is this: understanding how to utilize high-return tools and the long-term effects of compound interest is more important than the amount of money invested.\nA common misconception is that financial planning is only necessary after accumulating a large sum of money. In reality, the key factors influencing future wealth are the rate of return and the length of investment period, not the amount of capital. The key to successful financial management lies in maximizing returns and holding investments for the long term. While having more capital can accelerate wealth accumulation, it\u0026rsquo;s not the decisive factor.\nPerhaps you\u0026rsquo;ve considered investing but dismissed the idea due to limited funds. By doing so, you\u0026rsquo;ve missed a valuable opportunity to enhance your investment skills. The focus of investment should not be on \u0026ldquo;how much money is earned\u0026rdquo; but on \u0026ldquo;the rate of return\u0026rdquo; at which money is earned. For example, earning 5,000 yuan on a principal of 100,000 yuan represents a 5% return, which is a poor investment. Earning 2,000 yuan on a principal of 10,000 yuan represents a 20% return, which is a good investment. Over time, the latter will significantly outperform the former. Therefore, the earlier you learn financial management, the better. It allows limited funds to leverage the power of compound interest and create substantial wealth.\nThose with Less Should Strive Harder\nSome may question how to invest with only a few thousand or tens of thousands of yuan. In today\u0026rsquo;s developed financial markets, investment units are highly divisible. Around 10,000 yuan can buy a lower-priced stock, and a few thousand yuan can be invested in mutual funds. Real estate is also moving towards securitization. In short, there will be more investment options for smaller amounts in the future. Therefore, any idle funds not needed in the short term, even a few thousand yuan, should be invested.\nAre people truly too poor to manage small amounts of money? During the Chang Hwa Credit Cooperative bank run, many ordinary people withdrew hundreds of thousands of yuan. Statistics also show that the average bank deposit is 600,000 yuan, which is more than enough for investment purposes.\nEven those with no current savings or expecting limited future income shouldn\u0026rsquo;t underestimate themselves and give up on financial planning. While wealthy or high-income individuals have a head start, those with fewer assets or lower incomes should understand the principles of financial management and leverage it to compensate for their financial disadvantages, ultimately improving their lifetime financial situation.\nMoreover, individuals from humble beginnings and with modest incomes can achieve a greater sense of accomplishment by building wealth through diligent financial management. As the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s nothing remarkable about playing a good hand well; it\u0026rsquo;s playing a bad hand well that deserves admiration.\u0026rdquo; If you truly have no money, find ways to increase income and reduce expenses, save some money, and then start managing your finances. Remember, even a small amount of money is enough to begin. While the path to wealth may be longer and more challenging with limited initial funds, the goal is still achievable, and the journey itself is valuable.\n1. Investment and financial management are not exclusive to the wealthy or high-income earners.\n2. Those with limited assets or low incomes should leverage financial management to catch up.\n3. The amount of money you have when you start doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. Less money might even be better, allowing you to experiment with smaller investments initially and gradually increase your investment as you become more comfortable with risk.\n4. Leverage other people\u0026rsquo;s money to accelerate wealth building.\n","date":"9 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005962/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law III","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"9 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/small-investment/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Small Investment","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/youth-financial-management/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Youth Financial Management","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-09","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%88%9B%E4%B8%9A/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"创业","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-09","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%B0%8F%E9%92%B1%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"小钱投资","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-09","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%B9%B4%E8%BD%BB%E4%BA%BA%E7%90%86%E8%B4%A2/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"年轻人理财","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-09","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%B2%83%E4%BC%A6%E5%B7%B4%E8%8F%B2%E7%89%B9/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"沃伦·巴菲特","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-09","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E7%90%86%E8%B4%A2%E8%A7%82%E5%BF%B5/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"理财观念","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-09","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E8%80%90%E5%BF%83/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"耐心","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/family-precepts/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Family Precepts","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/financial-education/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Financial Education","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/income-and-expenditure/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Income and Expenditure","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/nobel-prize-foundation/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Nobel Prize Foundation","type":"tags"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law I: Don\u0026rsquo;t Keep Your Money in the Bank # The vast majority of people who fail at financial management don\u0026rsquo;t do so because they don\u0026rsquo;t earn enough, but because they put their assets in the wrong place. Have you ever heard of anyone getting rich from bank savings?\nSaving Equals Wasting Resources # There\u0026rsquo;s a parable in the Bible about financial stewardship. A landowner entrusted his property to three servants. He gave the first servant five units of money, the second two, and the third one. He told them to cherish and manage their wealth wisely, and he would return in a year to see how they had fared.\nWasting Time and Money\nThe first servant invested his money; the second bought raw materials and produced goods to sell; the third, for safety, buried his money under a tree. A year later, the landowner returned. The first two servants had doubled their wealth, pleasing the landowner. Only the third servant\u0026rsquo;s money remained unchanged. He explained, \u0026ldquo;Fearing loss through mismanagement, I kept the money safe. Today, I return it untouched.\u0026rdquo;\nThe landowner was furious. \u0026ldquo;You lazy servant!\u0026rdquo; he scolded. \u0026ldquo;You didn\u0026rsquo;t even try to utilize your wealth!\u0026rdquo; Wealth not utilized is wasted money and wasted potential. The third servant was rebuked not for misusing the money, nor for losing it through failed investments, but for keeping it \u0026ldquo;safe\u0026rdquo; and unproductive.\nKeeping money in the bank is the most common approach to personal finance today, and also the biggest mistake people make. Therefore, the first and most important financial rule this book offers is: Don\u0026rsquo;t keep your money in the bank. \u0026ldquo;Bank\u0026rdquo; here refers to post offices, commercial banks, and any other financial institution where money can be deposited.\nMany believe that earning interest in a bank, benefiting from compound interest, constitutes sound financial planning. In reality, with inflation, the real rate of return is close to zero, meaning no real financial gain. Therefore, leaving money in the bank is equivalent to no financial management at all.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s impossible to predict how much wealth each person will accumulate through financial management. The only certainty is that getting rich solely through bank savings is incredibly difficult. Ask yourself, \u0026ldquo;Have you ever heard of anyone getting rich purely from bank deposits?\u0026rdquo; Those who keep all their savings in the bank often find themselves not only failing to become wealthy in their old age but also struggling to maintain financial independence. Such stories are common. Those who choose bank deposits as their primary financial management method do so primarily for safety. However, readers must understand: \u0026ldquo;Money in the bank is safest in the short term, but the most dangerous form of financial management in the long term.\u0026rdquo;\nBlind Spots in Personal Finance\nMost people manage their finances by keeping their money in the bank, so most people are not wealthy.\nIf accumulating immense wealth were as easy as the examples suggest, then most people over 65 today would be millionaires. However, this is far from reality. Millionaires over 65 are few and far between, with many senior citizens facing financial hardship, relying on continued work or support from their children to make ends meet.\nSurveys on the elderly in Taiwan reveal increasingly serious financial challenges for senior citizens. Among approximately 1.48 million people aged 65 and above, about 13% rely on financial assistance from family and friends or social welfare. This demonstrates a serious problem with most people\u0026rsquo;s financial concepts and investment methods. How else could they reach old age not only without wealth but without even basic financial independence?\nTaiwan\u0026rsquo;s savings rate has historically been above 30%, currently hovering between 20% and 30%, consistently ranking among the highest globally. This indicates excellent performance in saving and budgeting. Consequently, we can deduce that flawed financial management is the primary reason for the lack of financial independence among ordinary people. To understand where they go wrong, we must first observe how they handle their assets. In various lectures, I often ask the audience, \u0026ldquo;How are your assets stored?\u0026rdquo; The majority answer: \u0026ldquo;In the bank.\u0026rdquo;\nPrioritizing Security over Investment\nSurveys on Taiwanese household investment preferences reveal that the top three investment choices are demand deposits (72%), rotating savings and credit associations (53%), and time deposits (36%). Clearly, most people lean towards traditional financial methods. Furthermore, when asked, \u0026ldquo;If you had 10 million Taiwan dollars in savings, how would you use it?\u0026rdquo;, about 41% of surveyed households said they would deposit it in a financial institution to earn interest. This illustrates the widespread preference for bank savings.\nIndeed, people have high savings rates and a strong preference for depositing money in financial institutions to earn interest. In early 1996, total deposits in Taiwanese financial institutions reached 12.6 trillion Taiwan dollars. With a population of 21 million, this translates to an average deposit of 600,000 Taiwan dollars per person, regardless of age. For an average family of four, this amounts to 2.4 million Taiwan dollars. This demonstrates a strong inclination towards bank savings. However, this traditional and conservative approach is the primary reason why most people fail to achieve wealth through investment.\nThis phenomenon reveals an over-reliance on traditional bank deposits for financial management. People prioritize safety and convenience over the rate of return. However, focusing solely on earning and saving money, then depositing it in a bank, is often the first step towards financial mismanagement.\nKeeping money in the bank is like having no financial plan at all.\nDeposit Interest Rates Lack True Compound Interest Benefits # What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with bank deposits? The problem lies in the low interest rates (return on investment), making them unsuitable for long-term investment tools.\nHow much interest can bank deposits earn? The salaries of average office workers are usually directly deposited into demand deposit accounts (current interest rates around 2%-4%). A portion serves as temporary funds or covers daily expenses, while the remainder is transferred to time deposits (current interest rates around 5%-8%) for investment purposes. Thus, the average interest rate earned on bank deposits is about 5%.\n5% Interest is Hardly a Path to Wealth\nMost people have a basic understanding of compound interest, believing that interest earned on bank deposits, accumulating over time, can create substantial wealth. This misconception arises from a superficial understanding of compounding. The vast differences in final returns resulting from different rates of return on the same principal over the same period often come as a surprise.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s illustrate with an example. Suppose someone saves 14,000 Taiwan dollars annually at the end of each year for 40 years, depositing everything into a bank account with an average interest rate of 5%. How much will they accumulate after 40 years? Before answering, recall the similar example from the previous section, but with the money in a bank instead of invested in stocks or real estate with an average annual return of 20%.\nYou might guess 25 million, 10 million, or even a conservative 5 million Taiwan dollars. The correct answer, however, is only 1.69 million. This can be calculated using the future value of an annuity formula:\n14,000×(1+0.05)40−10.05=1,690,00014,000×(1+0.20)40−10.20=102,810,000\nLet\u0026rsquo;s compare this with the 20% return scenario. The only difference between the two formulas is the rate of return (5% vs. 20%). A 20% return over 40 years yields 102.81 million Taiwan dollars, while a 5% return over the same period yields only 1.69 million, less than a fraction of the former. The difference is over 60 times! This illustrates the power of compound interest. Many assume they benefit from compound interest in a bank, but at a 5% return, even with compounding over a long period, the wealth creation effect is very limited.\nThis example demonstrates that one of the keys to successful financial management is the rate of return. The key is not just whether your assets are invested, but where they are invested and what the rate of return is.\nThe key to financial management lies in how your assets are allocated. The rate of return has a decisive impact on your future wealth. While bank savings provide interest income and the benefit of compounding, you\u0026rsquo;ll find that as you age, bank deposits contribute little to overall wealth growth. The first step towards building wealth through investment is to allocate assets to investments with high long-term rates of return. \u0026ldquo;Financial Management\u0026rdquo; is a significant factor contributing to wealth disparity in society. Inflation makes money worth less and less.\nThe Invisible Killer of Currency Value: Inflation # Forty years ago, a millionaire was truly wealthy. Today, a millionaire might struggle to afford a house. Why? Inflation. Every investor must consider the impact of inflation.\nInflation reduces the purchasing power of money and lowers the real rate of return, diminishing the effect of wealth accumulation.\nOver the past 30 years, the average annual inflation rate in Taiwan has been around 5%. What about the future? Inflation and economic growth are closely linked. As Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s economy continues to grow, inflation is expected to remain around 5% annually.\nInflation means continuously rising prices, which translates to decreasing purchasing power. If you keep your money in a demand deposit account earning 4% interest with a 5% inflation rate, what happens? Your purchasing power decreases. The longer your money sits in a savings account, the less it\u0026rsquo;s worth. What used to cost 10 Taiwan dollars for a newspaper now costs 15. Your 10 dollars can now only buy two-thirds of a newspaper. With inflation, money in the bank shrinks like wool submerged in water.\nSaving Alone Won\u0026rsquo;t Make You Rich, Not Even in Two Lifetimes\nWith 5% inflation and a nominal interest rate of around 5% on bank deposits, your real rate of return is zero. In this scenario, the effect of compound interest is nullified. Wealth accumulation relies solely on painstaking saving. Imagine someone saves 500,000 Taiwan dollars a year. How long would it take to become a billionaire? 200 years!\nSaving 500,000 Taiwan dollars a year is difficult; living for 200 years is even harder! Therefore, even with diligent saving and budgeting, if all the money is kept in the bank, this person won\u0026rsquo;t become wealthy in this lifetime, and worse, not even in the next! The average lifespan is around 75 years, meaning two lifetimes total only 150 years. It would take a third lifetime for someone relying solely on bank savings to potentially reach billionaire status. If a family maintains the financial strategy of \u0026ldquo;frugality and bank savings,\u0026rdquo; it would take at least 200 years, or about seven generations, for them to potentially become wealthy. Conversely, with proper financial management, wealth can be achieved in 40 years (half a lifetime).\nMoney in the Bank Should Be Spent Sooner Rather Than Later\nI remember 30 years ago, when I was in second or third grade, a popsicle cost 20 cents, and a red bean ice cream cost 50 cents. My parents gave me 50 cents each day for allowance, which I invariably spent on red bean ice cream after school. My parents constantly encouraged me to save, so my father opened a bank account for me. If I had been obedient and developed good saving habits from a young age, saving those 50 cents daily and earning 8% interest, it would have grown tenfold over 30 years, to 5 Taiwan dollars. However, a red bean ice cream now costs 15 Taiwan dollars. Those 5 dollars can only buy one-third of a red bean ice cream. More importantly, for a小学生 30 years ago, a red bean ice cream was precious. Even a dozen red bean ice creams today couldn\u0026rsquo;t compare to the value of one back then. Had I followed my parents\u0026rsquo; financial advice and kept my money in the bank, I would regret it now.\nTherefore, if you\u0026rsquo;re going to keep money in the bank, my sincere advice is: \u0026ldquo;Spend it sooner rather than later!\u0026rdquo; This might sound shocking, but there\u0026rsquo;s logic to it. From an economic perspective, money has more value and higher utility when used sooner. We save money in the bank, delaying gratification for the sake of greater enjoyment in the future. However, with inflation, money left in the bank often leads to less enjoyment.\nThe Value of Money Decreases with Age\nMy wife and her friends developed a financial philosophy: \u0026ldquo;Money is most valuable when spent while young.\u0026rdquo; This makes economic sense. Their reasoning: \u0026ldquo;When you\u0026rsquo;re old, delicacies might harm your health, traveling becomes difficult, and most importantly, wearing beautiful clothes attracts unwanted attention and ridicule.\u0026rdquo;\nThus, everyone managing their finances must be mindful of the dual pressures of inflation and the diminishing value of money with age. Bank deposit interest rates cannot compensate for these losses. In other words, money in the bank, while nominally increasing, actually decreases in value.\nOf course, I\u0026rsquo;m not encouraging you to spend all your savings immediately. Rather, I\u0026rsquo;m highlighting that if you keep money in the bank, you must consider the declining purchasing power due to inflation and the reduced economic benefit as you age. The fundamental solution is to withdraw your money from the bank and invest it in instruments with higher returns than bank deposit rates. Therefore, the best way to combat inflation is: Don\u0026rsquo;t keep your money in the bank. Invest in long-term, high-return assets like stocks and real estate.\nBecause inflation decreases real returns and hinders wealth accumulation, even saving 14,000 Taiwan dollars annually and investing in stocks or real estate for 40 years to become a billionaire won\u0026rsquo;t carry the same weight as being a billionaire today. Therefore, under inflation, consider using the real rate of return. If the return on investment is 20% and inflation is 5%, the real return is 15%. So how much should you save annually, investing in stocks or real estate with a nominal return of around 20% (real return of 15%), to become a billionaire in 40 years? The answer is 57,000 Taiwan dollars per year.\n57,000×(1+0.15)40−10.15=101,410,000\nA small step today makes a world of difference tomorrow.\nThe Path to Wealth of Chang Pin-san, Former Chairman of Chang Hwa Bank # Chang Po-hsin, the current standing director of Chang Hwa Bank, with assets exceeding tens of billions, inherited and expanded upon the fortune of his father, Chang Pin-san, the former chairman of Chang Hwa Bank, earning him a place among Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s wealthiest individuals.\nTrading Bank Deposits for Stock Dividends\nForty years ago, both Chang Pin-san and my father were from Nantun District, Taichung City. They were not only fellow townsmen but also colleagues. Back then, Chang Pin-san was just a junior manager at Chang Hwa Bank, without much wealth. However, he borrowed money to buy Chang Hwa Bank shares from colleagues who wanted to sell them. At the time, stock dividends were far lower than bank interest. Despite this, Chang Pin-san persisted in borrowing money to acquire shares, holding onto them for the long term. Other colleagues deposited the proceeds from their stock sales into banks. Years later, Chang Pin-san, owning the most shares, became the largest shareholder and eventually the chairman of Chang Hwa Bank, laying the foundation for his immense wealth.\nChang Pin-san was also friends with Lien Chen-tung, father of Lien Chan, and encouraged him to buy Chang Hwa Bank shares. The Lien family\u0026rsquo;s fortune also originated from those hundreds of Chang Hwa Bank shares.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to believe that the path to wealth could be so simple: borrow money to buy a few Chang Hwa Bank shares, invest in some real estate, hold them long-term, and essentially forget about them. Decades later, great wealth is attained. Those who sold their shares and deposited the money in banks are still wondering how others became rich. Some might attribute this to luck, but financial management is not about luck. It\u0026rsquo;s about the method chosen and the investment tools selected. Therefore, if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be poor, don\u0026rsquo;t keep your money in the bank.\nBank Savings Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t Exceed Living Expenses\nSomeone once jokingly asked me, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re telling us not to keep money in the bank. Are we supposed to pay with stocks or real estate certificates at the supermarket or restaurant?\u0026rdquo; Of course not! Advising against keeping money in the bank doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you can\u0026rsquo;t have any money in the bank at all. Bank deposits offer advantages: security and convenience. They are ideal for storing funds needed for daily expenses. However, you can\u0026rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too. Convenience comes at the cost of high returns.\nThe wise approach is to clearly divide funds into two categories: daily expenses and investments. Keep enough for daily needs in the bank, enjoying the security and convenience it offers. Invest the rest in higher-return assets like stocks and real estate.\nIn my opinion, keeping the equivalent of two months\u0026rsquo; living expenses in the bank is sufficient for an individual or family. Most individuals and families receive regular income, which is deposited into their bank accounts. Therefore, one month\u0026rsquo;s expenses for immediate use and another month\u0026rsquo;s worth as a safety net should be ample. The remaining funds should be invested in higher-return assets like stocks and real estate. In other words, if your monthly expenses average 50,000 Taiwan dollars, and your bank balance consistently exceeds 100,000, you are not managing your finances effectively. Actively seek suitable investment opportunities to make your surplus funds work for you.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Two Big, One Small\u0026rdquo; Approach to Flexible Fund Management\nSome believe in maintaining substantial emergency funds. However, even if unforeseen circumstances drain your bank savings, there\u0026rsquo;s no need to panic. The high-return investments mentioned earlier—stocks and real estate—are not as illiquid as some might think. Listed stocks in Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s active stock market can be sold almost any day of the year (excluding holidays), providing quick access to cash within a few days. Reluctant to sell? Stocks can also be used as collateral for loans.\nReal estate is less liquid than stocks, but many Taiwanese banks now offer \u0026ldquo;revolving mortgage loans,\u0026rdquo; allowing property owners to convert fixed assets into liquid assets. These loans involve mortgaging a property to secure a credit line of up to 70%-75% of the property\u0026rsquo;s value. Borrowers can draw and repay funds as needed, with interest accruing only on the outstanding balance. For example, a 10 million Taiwan dollar property could secure a 7.5 million credit line. Borrowing 5 million leaves 2.5 million available without interest charges, with interest accruing only on the 5 million borrowed. Any surplus funds can be used to repay the loan, reducing interest costs.\nMany financial experts recommend a \u0026ldquo;three-part\u0026rdquo; approach, dividing assets equally among bank savings, real estate, and more speculative investments. I propose a \u0026ldquo;two big, one small\u0026rdquo; approach: allocate most of your assets to stocks and real estate, keeping a small portion in a bank for daily expenses. This isn\u0026rsquo;t my invention. In fact, this is the portfolio strategy employed by many who have achieved wealth through investments.\nKeeping money in the bank is the riskiest form of financial management. Inflation erodes returns, leaving real interest rates near zero. Banks offer convenience, not high returns. Keep only two months\u0026rsquo; worth of living expenses in the bank. Trying to get rich with money in the bank is like trying to win a baseball game without swinging the bat. If all this hasn\u0026rsquo;t convinced you to reconsider keeping most of your money in a financial institution, perhaps the story of the Nobel Prize Foundation\u0026rsquo;s success might change your mind.\nChange your asset management perspective, change your financial destiny.\nLessons from the Nobel Prize Foundation # Every October, the Nobel Committee announces the Nobel laureates. The Nobel Prize attracts global attention not only for representing the highest academic honor but also because each laureate receives a substantial prize of 1 million US dollars.\nThe Folly of Depleting Capital\nThe Nobel Foundation awards several prizes annually, disbursing millions of dollars. This raises the question: How large is the Nobel fund to sustain such substantial payouts? The Nobel Foundation\u0026rsquo;s success, besides the substantial initial donation by Alfred Nobel over a century ago, is largely attributed to its shrewd financial management.\nEstablished in 1896 with a 9.8 million US dollar donation from Nobel, the foundation\u0026rsquo;s purpose is to fund the prizes. Flawless fund management was paramount. Initially, its charter stipulated that investments be restricted to safe, fixed-income instruments like bank deposits and government bonds, explicitly excluding stocks and real estate to avoid market risks.\nThis capital preservation approach, prioritizing safety over returns, seemed prudent, preventing losses. However, sacrificing returns had consequences. After 50 years of prize payouts and operating expenses, low returns depleted two-thirds of the Nobel fund, leaving only a little over 3 million US dollars by 1953.\nFrom 3 Million to 270 Million: The Secret\nFacing depletion, the Nobel Foundation\u0026rsquo;s board recognized the importance of investment returns. In 1953, they made a groundbreaking change, amending the charter to shift from bank deposits and bonds to primarily stocks and real estate. This shift in investment philosophy transformed the foundation\u0026rsquo;s fate. Over the next 40 years, despite continued prize payouts and operating costs, the foundation not only recovered all previous losses but also grew its assets to 270 million US dollars by 1993.\nNobel Prize Foundation Asset Growth and Decline\nYear Total Assets (Million USD) Remarks 1896 9.8 Foundation Established 1953 3.3 Investment Charter Amended 1993 270 Had the Nobel Foundation not changed its approach 40 years ago, clinging to bank savings, it would have vanished, unable to fund the prizes. Perhaps other wealthy individuals would have established new foundations with larger prizes, replacing the Nobel Prize.\nThe Nobel Foundation\u0026rsquo;s history underscores the importance of financial management. Even a substantial initial fund, if mismanaged, can be depleted. Conversely, even with significant spending, skillful management can generate rapid growth.\nI once heard of a Taiwanese hometown association that established a foundation with 100,000 Taiwan dollars 40 years ago to provide scholarships for children from their hometown. Forty years later, the fund remains at 100,000 Taiwan dollars. While a significant sum back then, today it barely covers administrative costs, threatening the foundation\u0026rsquo;s existence. The problem? Neglecting financial management.\nLearning from the Nobel Foundation, many US foundations, pension funds, university endowments, and even personal trusts have shifted from bank deposits and bonds to primarily stocks and real estate. In contrast, few Taiwanese foundations grasp this concept, and university endowments rarely address financial management seriously. The fate of these foundations, if they don\u0026rsquo;t adapt, is clear.\nI often participate in corporate training programs, where I habitually ask companies about the size and investment strategy of their employee welfare funds. The answers are usually similar: small funds, mostly in bank deposits, rarely exceeding a few hundred thousand or a million Taiwan dollars. However, in 1990, during my time at China Development Corporation, the employee welfare fund exceeded 200 million Taiwan dollars. Why? Because it was primarily invested in China Development Corporation\u0026rsquo;s own stock.\nThe Nobel Foundation\u0026rsquo;s course correction 40 years ago secured its status today. Prioritizing security above all else leads to asset depletion. The growth and decline of wealth for individuals, families, businesses, or other entities depends on their investment strategy. Will your hard-earned wealth shrink like the early Nobel fund, or grow like the later one? The key lies in how you invest. If, like many, you keep most of your money in the bank, it\u0026rsquo;s not too late to change. The Nobel Foundation\u0026rsquo;s story shows how a change in investment philosophy can transform everything. Should you reconsider your financial habits and prioritize investments in stocks and real estate? Let the Nobel Foundation inspire your financial thinking. A single change in mindset can lead to immense wealth decades from now!\n","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005960/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law I","type":"posts"},{"content":" Synopsis\nWritten by Mr. Huang Peiyuan from Taiwan, this book\u0026rsquo;s greatest strength lies in its departure from traditional thinking. It uses clear and easy-to-understand language to teach correct wealth management methods. The book outlines thirteen ironclad rules for effortless wealth management, guiding readers on how to establish a correct view of financial management. Many people strive to make money but don\u0026rsquo;t know how. Many possess the conditions for wealth but miss opportunities due to a lack of financial literacy. Even worse, some lose everything due to investment mistakes. The author draws on practical experience and extensive academic research, exploring these thirteen ironclad rules to help you \u0026ldquo;enjoy wealth management, achieve wealth with ease,\u0026rdquo; and confidently join the ranks of millionaires. About the Author\nHuang Peiyuan, Ph.D. in Business Administration from the University of California, Berkeley, General Manager of Sancai Construction and Real Estate Co., Ltd. Former Director of the Institute of Business Administration, Tunghai University, Deputy Director of the Project Business Department, China Development Trust Company, Vice President of East-West Securities, USA, Investment Manager at Merrill Lynch, USA, and financial advisor to numerous companies. Learning Wealth Management from the Lien Chan Family # The people of Taiwan are not only surprised by the enormous wealth of the Lien Chan family, the former chairman of the Kuomintang, but also harbor doubts. How could two generations of civil servants, with their meager salaries, accumulate wealth comparable to that of tycoon families?\nThis suspicion is deeply ingrained, but the Lien family is a prominent political family in Taiwan, and no one wants to antagonize them by probing too deeply.\nAs a journalist, the Lien family\u0026rsquo;s wealth has always been a puzzle to me. I even made a determined effort to uncover the truth, but to no avail. Six months ago, Professor Huang Peiyuan, then director of the Institute of Business Administration at Tunghai University, spoke about his desire to combine theory and practice and publish a \u0026ldquo;Personal Investment Bible.\u0026rdquo; After reading Professor Huang\u0026rsquo;s manuscript, the mystery of the Lien family\u0026rsquo;s wealth became clear to me. The Lien family is a perfect example of the principles in this \u0026ldquo;Personal Investment Bible.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps Lien Ya-tang, in his early years, wrote not only the renowned \u0026ldquo;General History of Taiwan,\u0026rdquo; but also a \u0026ldquo;Wealth Management Manual\u0026rdquo; passed down only within the family.\nAccording to Professor Huang\u0026rsquo;s (his title at the time; now he is in business) \u0026ldquo;Personal Investment Bible,\u0026rdquo; the first rule is \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t keep your money in the bank.\u0026rdquo; The second is that if you want to get rich, invest in stocks and real estate. This gives you the opportunity, with the income of an average office worker, to become a multimillionaire after 40 years of wealth management.\nBy this standard, the Lien family is indeed the most faithful follower of the \u0026ldquo;Personal Investment Bible.\u0026rdquo; When they had little wealth, Lien\u0026rsquo;s mother (Lien Chan\u0026rsquo;s mother) invested solely in stocks and real estate. Over the past few decades, the Lien family remained steadfast, waiting for the appreciation of their stocks and real estate, which naturally led to the vast wealth that now arouses public suspicion.\nSeveral decades ago, there were many business people who possessed similar wealth to the Lien family. These individuals also worked hard to manage their businesses and accumulate more wealth. However, compared to the Lien family now, most of them lament their inferiority in terms of wealth. The Lien family\u0026rsquo;s role as pure investors fully demonstrates that \u0026ldquo;as long as the concepts and methods are correct, wealth will naturally follow.\u0026rdquo;\nIn fact, the theories and methods in the \u0026ldquo;Personal Investment Bible\u0026rdquo; have been discussed by countless scholars and experts in mature Western societies, but not many have truly adhered to them and become millionaires as a result. The reason lies not in the inadequacy of the theories and methods, but in the lack of confidence and patience of those who apply them, leading them to give up halfway.\nTherefore, I advise all readers of this book to truly believe in the theories presented, have long-term patience, and adhere to them unwaveringly in order to succeed.\nWe wish all readers the ability to enjoy a happy retirement with sufficient financial resources, which is perhaps the greatest contribution of the \u0026ldquo;Personal Investment Bible\u0026rdquo; to the public! (This article is written by the president of Business Weekly Taiwan)\nThe Joy of Wealth Management, Achieving Wealth with Ease # When I was young, I thought that money was the most important thing in life; now that I am old, I know that it is.\n— Oscar Wilde, British playwright\nThis book is written for those who are determined to become wealthy and strive for financial independence. If you have tried every possible way to get rich and your home is filled with investment books, but you still can\u0026rsquo;t figure out how to achieve wealth in your lifetime, congratulations! You have found the book you need. The investment and financial management concepts and methods described in this book are absolutely understandable and achievable for everyone. As long as you put them into practice, becoming a millionaire is not difficult.\nI see many people working tirelessly to make money, hoping to improve their own and their families\u0026rsquo; financial situation, but they can\u0026rsquo;t find the right way. Many people clearly have the conditions to become rich through financial management, but they don\u0026rsquo;t know how to manage their finances, resulting in missed opportunities. Others know that investment and financial management can lead to wealth, but the problem is that what they know is not true, leading them astray and suffering from financial mismanagement. The author sees these phenomena and often feels sorry for them.\nThe biggest problem in Taiwan at present is the serious lack of financial education. The public lacks a correct concept of financial management. They either don\u0026rsquo;t know how to manage their finances and neglect it, or they use the wrong methods. As a result, some people not only fail to achieve wealth through financial management, but even fail to achieve basic financial independence. Insufficient or incorrect financial concepts are harmful not only to one\u0026rsquo;s own financial situation, but also to the public. This is the main motivation for the author to write this book, and what this book offers readers is the correct basic concept of investment and financial management.\nAs a scholar and a practitioner of financial management, I feel obligated to share my years of investment research results and practical experience in financial management with everyone, helping the public to easily manage their finances and achieve wealth through investment. The message this book wants to convey is: Financial management is actually very simple. Not only can everyone do it easily, but almost all young people have the conditions to achieve wealth through financial management.\nThis book is based on 20 years of practical financial management experience in the United States and Taiwan, 6 years of investment research at Tunghai University, and 15 years of experience as a financial advisor. In fact, the concepts and practices in this book were developed 3 years ago. For the past 3 years, the author has given lectures on this topic in various places and received tremendous feedback. Many listeners have continuously requested that I compile these concepts and action guidelines into a book. I personally also feel that these financial management concepts and action guidelines are indeed beneficial to the public and there is indeed a need to publish a book.\nHowever, putting these concepts into words is a difficult task for me, so I have procrastinated for 3 years. Recently, thanks to the repeated urging of Mr. He, President of Business Weekly Cultural Enterprise, and Ms. Sun Meiqing, and the examples and suggestions provided by Ms. Shen Wenci, and especially the efforts of Mr. Yang Weikai, who spent several months helping me revise and proofread, this book has finally been completed. I express my sincere gratitude here.\nIf this book can be read by the general public, and if they can accept the concepts and financial management methods described in the book, then all the author\u0026rsquo;s efforts will have been truly worthwhile. Good ideas should be shared with everyone. I hope everyone can benefit from them and easily become millionaires through financial management.\nFinally, I dedicate this book to my parents, Mr. Huang Minting and Ms. Huang Juzhi, who raised and nurtured me.\nPreface # In recent years, Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s economy has grown rapidly. While continuous economic growth is certainly gratifying, the problem of uneven wealth distribution has become increasingly serious. Some blame inappropriate government policies, while others believe it\u0026rsquo;s due to speculation, which has caused stock and housing prices to rise, widening the gap between rich and poor. The author believes that these factors are not the main cause. The real reason for the widening wealth gap is the significant disparity in financial literacy among the public.\nStarting in 1986, Taiwan officially entered an era of abundant capital and a focus on wealth management. The New Taiwan dollar slowly appreciated from 40 to 27 against the US dollar, and during this period, a large amount of foreign exchange flowed into Taiwan, creating a situation where \u0026ldquo;money overflowed in Taiwan.\u0026rdquo;\nDue to the excess capital, people began to shift their money towards investing in stocks and real estate. The huge influx of funds into the stock and housing markets caused stock and housing prices to soar. Between 1986 and 1989, housing prices increased by an average of two to four times, and the weighted stock market index rose from over 700 points in early 1986 to 12,680 points in February 1990, an increase of 18 times. Investing in stocks and participating in the capital market is inherently meaningful, and rising stock prices are a natural consequence of economic growth. Unfortunately, most investors adopted the wrong approach, believing that to profit in the stock market, they must buy low and sell high, earning the difference. In reality, short-term trading is not only time-consuming and laborious but also incurs huge transaction costs, resulting in most investors losing money. The stock market is almost equated with a casino.\nThe purpose of this book is to enlighten the public\u0026rsquo;s financial mindset by providing new perspectives, concepts, and methods to cope with the important yet complex investment environment. The author sincerely hopes that after reading this book, readers will develop a new financial mentality and adopt correct financial management methods.\n\u0026ldquo;Getting rich\u0026rdquo; is almost everyone\u0026rsquo;s desire, and most people think that their monthly income is not much, and the amount they can save is even less. At this rate of wealth accumulation, it seems impossible to get rich. But in fact, with enough time and proper financial management, becoming a millionaire is not impossible. Wealth accumulation through financial management requires only three basic conditions: regular savings, the pursuit of high returns, and long-term waiting.\nThe easiest way to achieve wealth through financial management is to learn from those who have done so. What are their methods? The secret of most successful wealth managers is not that they are smarter, harder working, or luckier than others, but that they have the habits and practices of wealth creation.\nIn the past, family financial management was rarely mentioned in school education. Perhaps this is because investment and financial management involve money, and most people think that making money with money has a connotation of getting something for nothing. In formal school education, teachers avoid mentioning it, believing that talking about money in education may corrupt people\u0026rsquo;s minds, especially making money with money, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem noble. However, long-term avoidance of this issue has only exacerbated the problem.\nThe people of Taiwan, through years of joint efforts, have created an economic miracle and accumulated a large amount of wealth. However, most individuals and families only know how to make money but not how to manage it, let alone how to use it wisely. After acquiring wealth, individuals, families, and even the entire society have suffered rather than benefited. For example, in recent years, money games have been prevalent. Many people are busy speculating in stocks and real estate, and various forms of gambling such as the Mark Six lottery, futures, and foreign exchange margin trading are still popular and becoming increasingly rampant. Many people are obsessed with money games, all for the purpose of making money and improving their family\u0026rsquo;s financial situation. However, if we calmly review the investment results of the past few years, it is not difficult to find that in the end, few have profited, many have lost, and even more have gone bankrupt. Everyone has worked in vain, and the result is only a rapid redistribution of wealth and a prevalence of unhealthy speculation in society. The wealth of individuals and society as a whole does not increase. This is all due to the public\u0026rsquo;s lack of clear understanding of financial management concepts.\nThe consequence of poor financial literacy is not only personal loss and family misfortune but also a waste of overall social resources. Let\u0026rsquo;s face this issue that is crucial to individuals, families, and the entire society: family financial management.\nAs the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;When a couple is poor, everything is sad.\u0026rdquo; This shows that if a family\u0026rsquo;s financial situation cannot meet the needs of family life, or if finances are not managed properly, happiness is hard to come by. Of course, there are many factors that contribute to a happy family, and wealth is only one of them, as many family problems cannot be solved with money. There is a saying: \u0026ldquo;Money is not everything, but without money, you can do nothing.\u0026rdquo; Although money is not the center of a family, in our real society, most good things require money. Wealthy families are not necessarily happy, but families without money are usually even less so. To make ourselves and our families happier, investment and financial management are indeed imperative. Investment and financial management can not only improve the financial situation of an individual or a family, but it is also a good way to accumulate wealth. Using financial management to achieve wealth is achievable for everyone, and it is something everyone should do.\nFuture wealth depends on the future investment environment, and the biggest characteristic of the investment environment, in a word, is change. The entire financial environment is ever-changing and unpredictable. This has been true in the past and will be even more so in the future. In the world of investment and financial management, there is constant change. It can be said that \u0026ldquo;the only constant is change.\u0026rdquo; It is foreseeable that the changes in the next 10 years will exceed those of the previous 50 years. Changes are not only becoming faster, but also more complex, diversified, and international. Whether we like it or not, we are already in a rapidly changing environment.\nFacing change, you can remain calm, adapt, and adopt the appropriate mental attitude. However, if you know how change will affect you, you may not dare to take it lightly. Because the natural consequence of any change is redistribution, including wealth, power, markets, personnel\u0026hellip; In terms of wealth, any change in the investment environment will naturally affect the flow of money at all levels. Indeed, in financial markets, capital markets, commodity markets, spot or futures markets worldwide, billions of dollars are traded every day, and wealth is constantly being redistributed. Your wealth may increase significantly during the redistribution process, or it may shrink rapidly. After long-term redistribution, you may become a billionaire, or you may become penniless, depending on how you face and deal with the changes.\nAny change and the resulting redistribution poses a \u0026ldquo;crisis\u0026rdquo; to your wealth to a greater or lesser extent. The Chinese characters for \u0026ldquo;crisis\u0026rdquo; are profound and often quoted in foreign books because they contain both danger and opportunity. \u0026ldquo;Wei\u0026rdquo; represents the threat to wealth, and \u0026ldquo;Ji\u0026rdquo; represents the opportunity for wealth creation.\nWe can wait for changes and redistribution to determine our future wealth level, or we can make good use of the opportunities brought about by change and try to reduce its destructive power. In this era of accelerating change, cultivating the ability to manage and respond to change is essential to controlling our own future.\nLooking ahead, changes in business, economy, finance, politics, society, and other aspects will accelerate. The overall financial environment will become more complex and unpredictable, and it is foreseeable that future wealth redistribution will inevitably accelerate. Therefore, for ourselves, our families, and society, everyone should play the role of a financial manager.\nThis is an era of rapid change and abundant wealth, and it is also an era that forces us to manage our finances. Everyone desires to become rich and improve their living standards or achieve their life goals. There are many ways to get rich, but the concept the author wants to elaborate on in this book is: Investment and financial management is one of the effective methods to achieve wealth. As long as you have the correct financial management concepts and put them into practice, whether you are rich or poor now, over time, you may become a millionaire through investment and financial management.\nIn this critical era related to our future wealth, you can no longer remain indifferent to financial management or ignorant of investment. You must adopt the correct financial concepts as early as possible, constantly acquire new knowledge, and avoid mistakes in order to win in the process of wealth redistribution.\nThe Story of the Mailman Who Got Rich\nMy brother-in-law has a friend in Taichung, a middle-aged man with a dark complexion and an occasional shy smile. My first impression of him wasn\u0026rsquo;t memorable until he drove away in a new BMW. The second time we met, he arrived in a Mercedes-Benz, which made me admire him. I realized that appearances can be deceiving and quickly asked him what kind of big business he was in. He said he wasn\u0026rsquo;t a businessman, just an ordinary office worker. I pressed him further, asking which big company he worked for. He said he worked at the post office. I thought he must be a senior executive to be so prestigious and own two luxury cars. The answer, however, was surprising. He replied, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a mailman. I deliver mail by motorcycle in the morning, with a monthly salary of NT$30,000-40,000.\u0026rdquo; I secretly speculated that he must specialize in delivering registered mail and was pocketing some of the contents. He then told me his story. His previous generation were poor farmers who left behind some land, which he had always regarded as ancestral property and kept without selling. No one expected that recent land consolidation would increase the value of his land by dozens of times. Now, just by renting out houses, he earns NT$500,000 in rent every month. This 48-year-old mailman didn\u0026rsquo;t rely on increasing income and reducing expenditure, but simply by putting his assets in the right place, he now has assets of more than NT$300 million. This is one of the examples of wealth accumulation through financial management in Taiwanese society.\nSimilar stories seem to happen frequently around us. Before I taught at the university, I worked for an investment company. Once, during the election of directors and supervisors at a shareholders\u0026rsquo; meeting, I discovered that a major shareholder holding more than NT$200 million worth of shares was actually a clerk in the company\u0026rsquo;s personnel department. It turned out that 35 years ago, when she joined the company as an employee, her salary was very low and her life was insecure, so she saved her meager salary. When company employees had fractional shares to transfer, she would buy them. After many years, this woman in her 50s, although unremarkable and not looking like a rich woman, now has a net worth of more than NT$200 million, enough to enjoy her retirement. In fact, there are countless examples of such ordinary office workers who have become wealthy through investment and financial management. Many people say that office workers cannot become rich, but in reality, wealthy office workers mostly don\u0026rsquo;t like to show off, so the way to get rich through investment and financial management is often overlooked.\nWhat Differentiates the Rich from the Poor?\nMany hardworking office workers who toil daily for money have had the common experience of watching rich people in expensive clothes, living in luxurious villas, and driving by in luxury cars, looking impressive and enviable. While admiring them, you may have wondered: \u0026ldquo;What makes them rich, but not me?\u0026rdquo;\nMany people attribute the wealth of these rich people directly to their being born rich, their successful entrepreneurial ventures, their being smarter, harder working, or luckier than others. However, family background, entrepreneurship, intelligence, hard work, and luck cannot explain all the reasons for wealth accumulation. We have all encountered many rich people, such as \u0026ldquo;nouveau riche\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;landowners.\u0026rdquo; They were not born into wealthy families, nor are they businessmen. They are not necessarily very smart, haven\u0026rsquo;t received much higher education, and are not more frugal than us. Some of them even idle around all day. The only thing they seem to be better at than you is that they are rich.\nWhat special skills do these rich people possess that are lacking in those office workers who diligently save money and work hard every day? How can they accumulate such enormous wealth in their lifetime? This is the question the author has been eager to explore for many years. I have tried to explain their wealth with factors such as family background, entrepreneurship, occupation, education, IQ, and effort, but all seem to have failed. After years of observation, induction, and academic research, I have discovered a very important factor that is often overlooked by most people: the ability to invest and manage finances. At the same time, I have also discovered the following three facts:\n1. One of the important factors that distinguishes the rich from the poor is: the ability to invest and manage finances.\n2. Everyone can achieve wealth through investment and financial management.\n3. The first thing to do to improve your financial situation is: to understand the basic concepts of investment and financial management. content_copy Use code with caution.\n","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005958/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Preface","type":"posts"},{"content":" The Correct Concept of Financial Management # The key to winning the wealth race lies not in the starting point, but in choosing the right track.\nInvestment Leads to Wealth # The Chinatrust Financial Holding Co., one of the top five conglomerates in Taiwan, was led by Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Koo\u0026rsquo;s Group, and Jeffrey Koo, chairman of Chinatrust Commercial Bank. The Koo\u0026rsquo;s Group encompassed seven major business segments: finance, manufacturing, construction, hotels, media, services, and overseas operations, with over 50 affiliated companies and total assets exceeding NT$460 billion. Many wondered how this uncle-nephew duo achieved both political and business success, and who was wealthier.\nThe Wealth Race Between Koo Chen-fu and Jeffrey Koo\nWealth often correlates with personality. Koo Chen-fu was a slow and steady type, while Jeffrey Koo was more of a go-getter. Due to their vastly different personalities, their investment approaches also differed significantly. Koo Chen-fu\u0026rsquo;s eldest son, Eugene Koo, the general manager of China Life Insurance in Taiwan, understood them well. He once said, \u0026ldquo;Money put in Koo Chen-fu\u0026rsquo;s pocket would never come out, but money put in Jeffrey Koo\u0026rsquo;s pocket would disappear.\u0026rdquo; This was because Jeffrey Koo continuously reinvested his money, leading to greater wealth accumulation than his uncle. Jeffrey Koo\u0026rsquo;s personal assets were spread across the US and Japan, invested in real estate, funds, hotels, golf courses, and banks. Koo Chen-fu, in his 80s, was quite conservative. Regarding his financial management philosophy, he said, \u0026ldquo;I neglect financial management and don\u0026rsquo;t want to worry about money.\u0026rdquo; His personal income was deposited in the bank by his secretary, and aside from necessary expenses, the rest was converted into fixed-term deposits.\nOver the years, Koo Chen-fu naturally had more cash on hand, as his money remained in the bank. However, in terms of wealth creation, Jeffrey Koo far surpassed him. Despite a 17-year age difference, with proper investment, one could still come out ahead.\nInvesting $1,200 Monthly Can Make You a Billionaire in 40 Years\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not what you don\u0026rsquo;t know that gets you into trouble. It\u0026rsquo;s what you know for sure that just ain\u0026rsquo;t so.\nThe first concept to understand about investment is: Investment not only improves financial situations but also allows anyone to achieve wealth.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s illustrate with a simple example:\nSuppose a young person with no savings starts saving NT$14,000 annually for 40 years. If this money is invested in stocks or real estate with an average annual return of 20%, how much wealth will they accumulate after 40 years?\nThe author often asks this question in lectures. Most guesses range from NT$2 million to NT$8 million, with a maximum of NT$10 million. The correct answer, however, is a surprising NT$102.81 million! For a 25-year-old, saving NT$14,000 annually (equivalent to $1,200 monthly) for 40 years, with a total investment of NT$560,000, could result in becoming a billionaire by age 65, assuming a 20% annual return in stocks or real estate.\nThis figure is calculated using the future value of an annuity formula in finance and investment. The calculation is as follows:\n1.4×(1+0.20)40−10.20=10281 (Units are in NT$10,000)\nThis formula illustrates how small amounts of money can grow significantly through investment. Understanding the formula isn\u0026rsquo;t crucial; most people who become billionaires through investment don\u0026rsquo;t know it, and knowing it doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee success.\nTherefore, with youth, ambition, investment knowledge, and three key factors—saving NT$14,000 annually, investing in stocks or real estate, and patiently waiting for 40 years—anyone can achieve wealth through investment, regardless of their current economic situation. These three factors are attainable for everyone:\nSaving NT$14,000 annually (NT$1,200 monthly) should be manageable for most. (If you can\u0026rsquo;t save this much, focus on saving before investing. This book may not be as helpful yet, as you need some capital to start investing.)\nHistorically, the long-term average return on stocks and real estate has been above 20%. Consistently investing in these assets and holding them long-term can yield a 20% average return. These investment tools are accessible to everyone. (Data shows that the Taiwan stock market has averaged around 20% annual returns over the past 20 years; studies show similar returns for Taiwan real estate over the past 40 years.)\n40 years seems long, but it\u0026rsquo;s a timeframe most people have. Starting work between 20 and 25 and retiring at 65 provides a 40-year investment window. While some are born rich and others poor, most have a fair chance at accumulating wealth over 40 years.\nThis example shows that investment not only improves finances but also provides a path to wealth. With the right concepts and practices, anyone can achieve wealth through investment.\nSmart Investing Can Shorten the Journey by 10 Years\nWhile the initial example uses 40 years to demonstrate the power of investing, most readers are likely in a better position. They may already have savings and can save more than NT$14,000 annually, shortening their path to wealth.\nThe table below illustrates the wealth accumulation over 10-year intervals using the previous example (investing NT$14,000 annually with a 20% return):\nIf you have NT$360,000, congratulations! You\u0026rsquo;ve saved 10 years of effort. By continuing to invest in stocks or real estate, you could become a billionaire in 30 years. With NT$2.61 million, you\u0026rsquo;ve saved 20 years. With NT$16.55 million, you\u0026rsquo;re even closer, needing only 10 more years.\nInvestment Years Accumulated Amount (NT$10,000) Amount Accumulated in the Last Decade (NT$10,000) 10 36 36 20 261 225 30 1655 1394 40 10281 8626 Most readers likely have some savings, allowing them to achieve significant wealth in 20-30 years.\nInvesting Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Require Advanced Knowledge\nThe trouble with the world is not that people know too little, but that they know so many things that just aren\u0026rsquo;t so.\nMany believe investing requires perfect timing and extensive financial knowledge. This isn\u0026rsquo;t entirely true. After years of studying investment, and witnessing ordinary people achieve wealth through it, I can confidently say that investment success doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend on academic qualifications, intelligence, technical skills, or predictive abilities. It depends on doing the right things. Successful investors aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily highly educated or technically skilled; they can be ordinary people who understand fundamental principles.\nBy doing the right things, anyone can achieve wealth through investment, regardless of their background or effort. Investing doesn\u0026rsquo;t require genius or specialized knowledge; common sense and consistent action are key. Investors don\u0026rsquo;t need to rely on experts; with the right mindset, you can outperform them.\nInvesting isn\u0026rsquo;t about complex techniques; it\u0026rsquo;s about having the right mindset. Successful investors simply cultivate habits that most people find uncomfortable or difficult to maintain. Do you understand that investing can create wealth? If so, are you actively pursuing it?\nFrom another perspective, investing can be challenging. The difficulty lies not in needing advanced knowledge, but in going against ingrained habits. This is difficult for most people.\nThis book presents seemingly simple investment concepts, but wealth is built through consistent, correct habits. Start your investment journey by building the right habits!\nThe amount of money you accumulate in your lifetime depends not on how much you earn, but on how you manage it.\nSaving Alone Is Not Enough # A Taiwanese proverb says, \u0026ldquo;People have two legs, money has four.\u0026rdquo; Money chases money faster than people chase money.\nTraditional wisdom dictates that \u0026ldquo;the path to wealth lies in diligence and frugality.\u0026rdquo; This held true in times of economic stagnation, but in today\u0026rsquo;s rapidly changing economy, this mindset requires adjustment.\nA century ago, before modern economics became widespread, during periods of economic stagnation and frequent wars, saving was indeed crucial for wealth accumulation. Today, however, with global economic growth and soaring stock and real estate prices, the focus should shift from saving to leveraging the power of compound interest for exponential growth.\nHow Did Lien Chan Become Wealthy?\nWith so many assets, it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to monitor everything closely. During the period of entrusted management, the principle was to hold existing investments and not trade stocks or dispose of real estate.\nLien Chan, with an estimated net worth of nearly NT$6 billion, was one of Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s wealthiest officials. His wealth wasn\u0026rsquo;t accumulated through decades of frugal living on a government salary or through earning a doctoral degree. It stemmed from his mother\u0026rsquo;s shift in investment strategy over 40 years prior.\nAround 1951, Chang Pin-san, former chairman of Chang Hwa Bank, advised Lien Chan\u0026rsquo;s father, Lien Chen-tung, to invest in shares of the \u0026ldquo;Big Three\u0026rdquo; commercial banks. Following this advice, Lien Chan\u0026rsquo;s mother, Chao Lan-kun, invested her savings in hundreds of shares of Chang Hwa Bank, holding them long-term and letting their value appreciate naturally. This laid the foundation for the Lien family\u0026rsquo;s fortune. Chao Lan-kun had a keen financial mind. Unlike other women who participated in rotating savings and credit associations or simply deposited money in banks, she actively invested. She sold ancestral farmland in Miaoli and co-developed a property on Nanjing West Road with Huang Lie-huo, founder of Wei Chuan Foods Corporation, splitting the profits. This prime real estate became a significant source of wealth for the Lien family.\nStocks, real estate, and land were the Lien family\u0026rsquo;s wealth-generating tools. Over the years, Lien Chan accumulated holdings in 19 different stocks, including Chang Hwa Bank, Taipei Business Bank, Hua Nan Bank, and Cathay Life Insurance. His real estate holdings were located in prime areas like the Da\u0026rsquo;an, Shilin, and Zhongshan districts, including 11 plots of land and 26 properties.\nLien Chan once described his family\u0026rsquo;s investment approach as \u0026ldquo;Wu Wei Er Zhi\u0026rdquo; (doing nothing and achieving everything), meaning buying and holding long-term. By investing in stocks and real estate 40 years ago and patiently holding them, with minimal trading and benefiting from annual returns exceeding 20%, they amassed a fortune nearing NT$10 billion.\nYou might argue that the Lien family was already wealthy 40 years ago. This might be true, but the point is that while they were prominent, many families in Taiwan were wealthier back then. Today, very few families surpass the Liens in wealth. This is attributed to their early adoption of the correct investment strategy – focusing on stocks and real estate.\nThe Key to Wealth Lies in Financial Management, Not Just Saving\nThe ability to earn money is less important than having a mind for financial management, understanding how to make money work for you.\nChinese culture values diligence and frugality. Older generations often teach younger ones that the path to wealth lies in these principles and careful budgeting. The saying \u0026ldquo;Great wealth comes from heaven, small wealth from frugality\u0026rdquo; encourages thriftiness, as it\u0026rsquo;s seen as the key to wealth. This emphasis on saving is reflected in Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s high savings rate. However, I want to convey a crucial message: while saving is important, financial management is even more so.\nIn the previous example, how much of the NT$100+ million fortune came from diligence and frugality? The answer is NT$560,000, accumulated by saving NT$14,000 annually for 40 years. This represents only 0.5% of the total. The remaining 99.5% came from investment, specifically the power of compound interest at a 20% annual return over 40 years. Which is more important, saving or investing? Therefore, lifetime wealth accumulation depends not on how much you earn, but on how you manage your money.\nIf a worker realizes in old age that their wealth primarily comes from a lifetime of hard work and saving, it\u0026rsquo;s almost certain they won\u0026rsquo;t be very wealthy. The key to wealth through investment isn\u0026rsquo;t the ability to \u0026ldquo;earn and save,\u0026rdquo; but the ability to leverage the \u0026ldquo;compounding power of money.\u0026rdquo; For most, improving their financial situation requires focusing on investment, not just saving.\nConsider this: saving NT$1 million annually without investing would take 100 years to reach NT$100 million. In contrast, investing NT$14,000 annually could make you a billionaire in 40 years. If Chao Lan-kun had only focused on saving and not investing, would the Lien family be as wealthy as they are today?\nI\u0026rsquo;m not dismissing the importance of saving, but I want to emphasize that it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t overshadow investment. Investment plays a crucial role in wealth accumulation. For successful investors, wealth comes primarily from \u0026ldquo;making money work for you,\u0026rdquo; not from earning or saving. Therefore, in addition to being diligent and frugal, learn how to invest.\nTo improve your financial situation, remember: earning is important, but managing your money is more so. A correct investment mindset and wise investment choices have a greater impact on your future financial status than your current wealth or future income. For most, the first step towards improving their finances is not to increase saving, but to understand the correct investment concepts and take action.\n1. For those who achieve wealth through investment, their fortune comes primarily from making money work for them, not from earning or saving.\n2. Less than 1% of a NT$100 million fortune comes directly from earned income.\n3. Investment is not a technique, but a mindset.\n4. The key to financial management is having money to manage, not the amount of money.\nThose who learn to invest are like having a money-printing machine.\nHow Investment Strategies Create the Wealth Gap # A study indicates that in recent years, the public has perceived a serious wealth gap in Taiwan, with a trend towards wealth polarization. Over 47% of respondents believe that \u0026ldquo;speculation in stocks or real estate\u0026rdquo; is the main cause of this widening gap, followed by \u0026ldquo;personal work ability and effort\u0026rdquo; (14%) and \u0026ldquo;family background\u0026rdquo; (11%). This suggests a common belief that the wealth gap isn\u0026rsquo;t solely due to individual effort, but also to systemic issues, luck, and unequal opportunities.\nIndeed, \u0026ldquo;stocks and real estate\u0026rdquo; are major contributors to the wealth gap, while \u0026ldquo;personal work ability and effort\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;family background\u0026rdquo; have less impact. People often attribute their poverty to external factors like systemic issues, luck, or lack of opportunity, or use negative terms like \u0026ldquo;speculation\u0026rdquo; to explain their lack of action. Wealthy individuals often accumulate their wealth through real estate or stock investments, not primarily through \u0026ldquo;speculation,\u0026rdquo; but through \u0026ldquo;holding appropriate investment assets.\u0026rdquo;\nLooking ahead, the wealth gap will likely continue to widen. Some will benefit, while others will suffer, depending on their ability to navigate the changing landscape. External factors alone don\u0026rsquo;t determine our financial situation; our investment abilities play a crucial role.\n1. Financial habits create the difference between the rich and the poor.\n2. The prerequisite for building wealth through investment is allocating assets to high-return investments like stocks or real estate.\n3. One way for the government to address the widening wealth gap is to educate the public about proper financial management.\nGreater Investment, Greater Returns\n\u0026ldquo;Thoughts change actions, actions change habits, habits change character, and character changes destiny.\u0026rdquo;\nImagine two classmates who join the same company after graduation, holding similar positions with the same salary. Both are equally frugal, saving NT$14,000 annually for investment. The difference lies in their approach: one keeps their savings in the bank, while the other invests in stocks. Both largely leave their money untouched after depositing or investing it.\nAfter 40 years, the stock investor becomes a billionaire, while the bank saver becomes a \u0026ldquo;millionaire.\u0026rdquo; While a billion represents significant wealth, \u0026ldquo;millionaire\u0026rdquo; now evokes laughter, being synonymous with \u0026ldquo;homeless\u0026rdquo; in Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s expensive housing market.\nThe \u0026ldquo;millionaire\u0026rdquo; classmate, seeing their former colleague with the same starting conditions become a billionaire, might assume foul play or lottery winnings. How could their wealth differ so drastically, with one rich and the other struggling?\nThose with less wealth often attribute the success of the wealthy to luck or illicit activities. A more positive view might be that they worked harder or were more frugal. However, they often overlook the critical factor: financial habits. The rich and poor manage their money differently: the rich hold assets like real estate and stocks, while the poor keep their money in the bank.\nTo become wealthy through investment, one must break free from conventional thinking. An adult who couldn\u0026rsquo;t ride a bicycle saw a child doing so and complained, \u0026ldquo;Only agile children can ride bikes.\u0026rdquo; The child responded, \u0026ldquo;Agility isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary,\u0026rdquo; and taught the adult to ride. The adult quickly learned but, upon parting ways, instinctively pushed the bicycle home instead of riding it. This illustrates the difficulty of breaking free from ingrained habits.\nIf financial management is the primary cause of the wealth gap, the solution lies in improving financial literacy and encouraging people to learn more about investing.\nFocusing Solely on Saving is Outdated\nIf one adheres to the principles of investment, it\u0026rsquo;s hard not to become wealthy. If one doesn\u0026rsquo;t, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to become wealthy.\nI often wonder why, after over 200 years since their ancestors arrived in Taiwan with nothing, most Taiwanese families aren\u0026rsquo;t significantly wealthy. Perhaps the problem lies in outdated family precepts that hinder wealth accumulation.\nFamily precepts are the guiding principles passed down through generations. Most families emphasize diligence, frugality, and academic excellence, believing these are the keys to success and wealth.\nMany families diligently follow these precepts, raising children who are both frugal and well-educated. However, few families achieve significant wealth through these alone. These precepts focus on earning money, not on managing it. To build generational wealth, families need to update their guiding principles. While \u0026ldquo;diligence and frugality\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;academic excellence\u0026rdquo; remain valuable, add another: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t keep money in the bank.\u0026rdquo;\nWhy retain \u0026ldquo;diligence and frugality\u0026rdquo;? While saving alone won\u0026rsquo;t lead to great wealth, it\u0026rsquo;s a virtue and a necessary foundation for investment.\nEducating the Next Generation Requires a Balanced Approach\nWhy keep \u0026ldquo;academic excellence\u0026rdquo;? Studies show a weak correlation between education and wealth. Academic success doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee financial success. Based on this, I once stopped emphasizing academics with my children, resulting in declining grades. Their teacher, puzzled, asked, \u0026ldquo;You and your wife are both highly educated, why don\u0026rsquo;t your children share this trait?\u0026rdquo; I was ashamed.\nI immediately reinstated the emphasis on academics. I realized it was partly for our own pride, but also because education can enhance social standing and job security. So, for both parents and children, academic pursuits remain important.\nHowever, for future generations to prosper, add another precept: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t keep money in the bank!\u0026rdquo; Encourage children to invest in assets like stocks and real estate, rather than leaving money in low-interest bank accounts. Otherwise, building significant wealth might take generations.\nEvery Lunar New Year, I buy stocks for my children instead of giving cash. My second-grader is already learning the importance of investing over saving. This concept should be ingrained early as part of family values, fostering a healthy financial mindset from a young age.\nIn conclusion, most family precepts are outdated. Building wealth for future generations requires new concepts and practices. By updating family values and changing how we accumulate wealth, families can achieve lasting prosperity.\n1. Diligence, frugality, and academic excellence alone are not enough for building lasting wealth.\n2. Teach children not to keep money in the bank, cultivating a proper investment mindset from a young age.\n3. Leaving money to children might sustain them for a few years; teaching them how to manage it can provide for a lifetime and for generations to come.\n","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005959/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: The Correct Concept of Financial Management","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/wealth-creation/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Wealth Creation","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/wealth-gap/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Wealth Gap","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-08","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%AE%B6%E8%AE%AD/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"家训","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-08","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%BC%80%E6%BA%90%E8%8A%82%E6%B5%81/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"开源节流","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-08","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E7%90%86%E8%B4%A2%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"理财教育","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-08","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E8%AF%BA%E8%B4%9D%E5%B0%94%E5%A5%96%E5%9F%BA%E9%87%91%E4%BC%9A/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"诺贝尔奖基金会","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-08","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E8%B4%AB%E5%AF%8C%E5%B7%AE%E8%B7%9D/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"贫富差距","type":"tags"},{"content":" I. Summary # \u0026ldquo;The Intelligent Investor\u0026rdquo; is a seminal work in the field of investment, authored by Benjamin Graham, widely regarded as the \u0026ldquo;father of value investing\u0026rdquo;. The book aims to provide guidance on investment strategies for the layman, with the following core ideas:\nRational Investment: Investment decisions should be based on thorough analysis of a security\u0026rsquo;s value, not on market sentiment or speculative behavior. Margin of Safety: The core of investing is the margin of safety, which means buying securities at a price significantly below their intrinsic value, thus reducing risk and enhancing potential returns. Defensive and Enterprising Investors: Based on risk tolerance and investment objectives, investors are classified as either defensive or enterprising, each employing different investment strategies. Investors and the Market: Investors should view market fluctuations rationally, seeing them as opportunities rather than sources of risk. Company Owner Mentality: Investors should adopt the mindset of a company owner, paying attention to corporate management and governance and safeguarding their own interests. II. Chapter Summaries # Chapter 1: What Intelligent Investors Get # This chapter introduces fundamental concepts of investing, including:\nInvesting vs. Speculation: Investing is an operation based on analysis, aiming for safety of principal and a satisfactory return; speculation is hoping for profit from market fluctuations and carries higher risk. Defensive Investors: Seeking safety and steady returns, they can adopt a simple portfolio strategy, allocating funds between high-grade bonds and a diversified selection of leading common stocks. Enterprising Investors: Willing to take on more risk for greater returns, they can employ more aggressive strategies, such as selecting growth stocks and seeking undervalued securities. Chapter 2: The Investor and Market Fluctuations # This chapter explores how investors should view market fluctuations:\nPrice Fluctuations as a Measure of Investment Success: In the long run, investment success depends on the long-term returns of the portfolio, not short-term price movements. Market Fluctuations as a Guide for Investment Decisions: Investors can capitalize on market volatility to create opportunities for buying low and selling high, but should avoid excessive focus on short-term market trends. Market Fluctuations of Individual Stocks: Focusing on undervalued individual stocks is more meaningful than attempting to predict overall market movements. Chapter 3: A Review of the 1964 Market # This chapter analyzes the stock market conditions at the time of writing (1964):\nComparison with Previous Years: The stock market was at a historical high, rendering traditional valuation methods no longer applicable. New Standards for a \u0026ldquo;New Era\u0026rdquo;: New valuation methods had not yet been tested by time, and the market was characterized by a high degree of uncertainty. Investment Strategy Recommendation: Adopt a cautious investment strategy and avoid excessive risk-taking. Chapter 4: The Investor and His Advisers # This chapter discusses the relationship between investors and their advisors:\nSources of Investment Advice: Investors can obtain investment guidance from various avenues, including family and friends, banks, brokerage firms, and professional investment advisors. Selecting Investment Advisors: Choosing the right advisor is crucial, requiring careful assessment of their expertise, experience, and ethical standards. Independent Thinking: Even when seeking professional advice, investors should maintain their own independent judgment and be responsible for their investment decisions. Chapter 5: The Defensive Investor\u0026rsquo;s Portfolio Policy # This chapter details the strategies for defensive investors:\nBond and Stock Allocation: Allocate funds between high-grade bonds and a diversified selection of leading common stocks. The ratio can be adjusted based on market conditions, but generally maintain a 50:50 split. Bond Portfolio Composition: Introduces characteristics of different types of bonds, such as US Savings Bonds, state and municipal bonds, and corporate bonds. Principles for Common Stock Selection: Choose large, prominent, and conservatively financed companies with a long history of dividend payments, and purchase them at reasonable price-earnings ratios. Chapter 6: Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach # This chapter presents a \u0026ldquo;negative list\u0026rdquo; of what enterprising investors should avoid:\nSecond-Grade Bonds and Preferred Stocks: Avoid buying securities lacking sufficient safety merely for the allure of high yields. Foreign Government Bonds: Higher risk and difficulty in enforcing claims in case of default. New Issues: Require careful evaluation and avoidance of excessive hype surrounding them. Convertible Issues: Their advantages often come at the expense of quality or income, and they present investors with decision-making dilemmas. New-Issue Mania: During bull markets, many smaller companies go public, and their stock pricing is often unattractive or even excessive. Investors should be wary of the hype surrounding new issues and avoid blindly following the crowd. Chapter 7: Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side # This chapter discusses positive strategies enterprising investors can employ:\nMarket Timing Limitations: While the strategy of buying low in depressed markets and selling high in booming markets could be profitable in the past, recent market dynamics have made this approach less viable. Considerations for Growth Stocks: Selecting growth stocks requires diligent assessment of future growth potential, avoiding overpaying for lofty expectations. Three Recommended Areas for Enterprising Investment: Investing in Large Companies during Unpopular Periods: When large companies are experiencing unpopular periods, their stock prices may be undervalued, presenting opportunities for investors. Bargain Issues: Seek securities whose intrinsic value is demonstrably understated and buy them at prices significantly below this value. Special Situations: Focus on events like mergers, reorganizations, and liquidations where the price fluctuations can offer substantial profit opportunities. Broad Application of Investment Rules: Enterprising investors should approach investing as a business endeavor, adhering to sound business principles, such as knowing their investment domain, choosing partners carefully, and managing risk. Chapter 8: Security Analysis for the Lay Investor: General Approach # This chapter introduces basic methods of security analysis for non-professional investors:\nBond Analysis: Focus on the ratio of earnings to interest expenses, ensuring it meets certain standards (4x for utilities, 5x for railroads, 7x for industrials). Consider factors like company size, equity ratio, and asset value. Understand the risk characteristics of different bond types, like the relatively higher risk of railroad bonds compared to the safer utility company bonds. Common Stock Analysis: Analyze company profitability, including projected future earnings, sales margins, and return on net worth. Assess capitalization rates, considering factors like long-term prospects, management quality, financial condition, and dividend record. Pay attention to the impact of non-recurring gains and losses, making adjustments to earnings data. Industrial Stock Analysis: Focus on industry trends and individual companies\u0026rsquo; competitive positions within their respective sectors. Chapter 9: Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor # Using Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks as an example, this chapter explains how defensive investors can select securities:\nChoose a Representative Sample: For instance, buy equal amounts of all 30 Dow Jones industrial stocks. Exclude Stocks with Excessive Price-Earnings Ratios: Avoid overpaying for speculative growth. Select Relatively Unpopular Stocks with Reasonable Valuations: Capitalize on the market\u0026rsquo;s neglect of certain stocks, finding undervalued investment opportunities. Chapter 10: Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor: General Approach # This chapter introduces methods for enterprising investors to select securities:\nThe Valuation Approach: Estimate a company\u0026rsquo;s future earnings and select a suitable multiplier to determine its intrinsic value. Factors Affecting Asset Value: Pay attention to net tangible asset value, especially net current asset value. Add half the excess of net current asset value over earnings power value to the earnings power value for a more comprehensive assessment. Growth Stock Valuation: Consider the expected growth rate, but be cautious in assessing its reasonableness. The author provides a simplified formula for growth stock valuation: Value = Current (normal) earnings x (8.5 + 2 x expected annual growth rate). First-Grade vs. Second-Grade Common Stocks: Enterprising investors can consider buying second-grade common stocks, but only at bargain prices, namely when their price is less than two-thirds of the indicated intrinsic value. Chapter 11: Security Analysis for the Lay Investor: Six Illustrative Cases # This chapter uses six real-world cases to illustrate how to apply security analysis techniques to uncover undervalued investment opportunities:\nCase 1: Northern Pacific Railroad common stock (1947): The company\u0026rsquo;s stock price was undervalued due to a combination of a low dividend payout and the non-inclusion of certain earnings in its income statement. Case 2: Standard Gas and Electric (SP\u0026amp;L) $7 preferred (1947): Analyzed the complex capital structure of SP\u0026amp;L, pointing out the undervaluation of its preferred stock. Case 3: American-Hawaiian Steamship (AHS) (1947): The company held substantial cash assets that were not reflected in its market price. Case 4: Royal Dutch Petroleum (RDP) (1953): Pointed out that the market value of RDP was undervalued relative to its earnings power. Case 5: Hoover Company Class A (1957): The company\u0026rsquo;s stock was undervalued because the net worth of its British subsidiary was not fully reflected. Case 6: Chicago, Terre Haute \u0026amp; Southeastern Railway (TH) bonds (1964): Analyzed the value of TH bonds, indicating their undervaluation compared to comparable bonds. Chapter 12: Stock Market Fluctuations: The Pattern of Behavior # This chapter analyzes the patterns of earnings and price fluctuations for different types of stocks:\nPattern 1: Relatively Stable Earnings, Wide Price Fluctuations: Using S.H. Kress as an example, the chapter demonstrates how even with stable earnings, market prices can fluctuate greatly, primarily driven by market sentiment. Pattern 2: Earnings Fluctuate Moderately, Stock Prices Fluctuate Widely: Using General Motors as an example, it illustrates how stock price volatility often exceeds earnings volatility and advises investors to view such fluctuations rationally. Pattern 3: Extreme Ups and Downs: Taking examples like Brunswick Corporation and St. Louis Southwestern Railway, the chapter highlights the substantial uncertainties in company development and stock price movements. Investors should be wary of companies experiencing extreme volatility. Pattern 4: Growth Stocks: Using examples like 3M and Philip Morris, the chapter shows that even growth stocks face risks, and investors should carefully evaluate their growth potential and avoid overpaying for lofty expectations. Chapter 13: A Comparison of Eight Pairs of Companies # This chapter uses comparative analysis of various stock portfolios to further investigate factors impacting stock prices:\nFour Groups of Randomly Selected Cases and the Dow Jones Industrial Average: By contrasting the performance of stocks in different market standings and comparing their initial trading dates, the chapter suggests that choosing large, strong companies often yields more consistent results. New stocks of smaller companies carry higher risk. Secular Changes in the Quality of a Company Group: Taking railroad stocks as an example, the chapter highlights how the standing and investment merit of companies within a group can shift significantly over time. The Results of a Policy of Quality Improvement: Using the Dow Jones Industrial Average as an example, the chapter illustrates that merely replacing underperforming components with more popular ones does not necessarily lead to sustained investment gains. Stock selection should be based on a combination of company quality and price. Chapter 14: Stockholders and Management # This chapter explores the relationship between stockholders and company management:\nManagement Efficiency: How to assess Management efficiency: By comparing key indicators like profitability, sales margin, and return on net worth to industry averages. How to improve inefficient management: Stockholders can take actions like raising questions at shareholder meetings, hiring independent management consultants for assessment, and electing more independent board members. The Board of Directors: Role in Corporate Governance: The board represents shareholder interests, oversees management, sets company strategy, and reviews and approves significant decisions. Stockholder Oversight of the Board: Stockholders can exercise their influence by electing board members and voting on proposals at shareholder meetings. Fair Treatment of the General Stockholder: Management\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to protect outside stockholder interests: Management should set a fair dividend policy, avoid repurchasing stock at excessively low prices, and prioritize shareholder interests. Holding Companies: Disadvantageous position of outside stockholders within holding companies: Holding companies often present conflicts between controlling shareholder interests and those of outside stockholders, leading to potential harm to the latter. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Investor Protection: SEC\u0026rsquo;s functions and limitations: The SEC oversees the securities market and protects investor interests. However, its powers and functions are limited and cannot fully guarantee investor rights. Chapter 15: \u0026ldquo;Margin of Safety\u0026rdquo; as the Central Concept of Investment # This chapter summarizes the core concept of the book - the Margin of Safety:\nDefinition of Margin of Safety: Purchasing securities at a price significantly below their intrinsic value, thereby mitigating risk and enhancing potential returns. Application in Different Investment Types: Bonds, common stocks, growth stocks, bargain issues, and other asset classes. Margin of Safety and Diversification: Diversification can reduce the overall risk of a portfolio and therefore enhances the margin of safety. Distinguishing Investment from Speculation: The margin of safety is a key criterion for differentiating investment operations from speculative ones. Investment operations should be based on a clear and demonstrably justifiable analysis of value, while speculative operations rely more heavily on subjective judgment and market sentiment. Generalization of the Investment Concept: The idea of margin of safety can be applied to broader investment domains, such as when purchasing real estate, art, or other assets. III. Key Quotes # \u0026ldquo;In Wall Street, if you\u0026rsquo;re always doing what\u0026rsquo;s obvious or what everyone else is doing, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to make money.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This emphasizes that to achieve above-average returns, investors require independent thinking and must seek value that is overlooked by the market.\n\u0026ldquo;For rational investment, mental attitude is more important than technique.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: Investment success necessitates not just skills and tools, but also the right investment philosophy and mindset, including rationality, patience, and discipline.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t buy after a stock has surged and don\u0026rsquo;t sell after it has plummeted.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: Avoid chasing rising prices and panicking during market dips.

Investors need to be confident and courageous in their convictions, even when facing dissenting opinions.

Investing should be grounded in acquiring assets at a price that provides a buffer against uncertainty and potential errors in judgment.\nIV.

Main Topic # This session revolves around investment and life planning. The core ideas are: be optimistic about investment and keep learning, ignoring short-term market fluctuations; young people should focus on asset appreciation, with Nasdaq 100 index funds being the top choice; utilize leverage and allocate assets reasonably; retirees should plan carefully and avoid excessive debt; and one should stay optimistic and confident, avoid material comparisons, and pursue true freedom.\nII. Presentation Content # Investment Philosophy and Market Analysis # Market Fluctuations and Investment Mentality: The market is always fluctuating. Don\u0026rsquo;t let short-term fluctuations affect your investment decisions. Stay optimistic. Currency Devaluation and Asset Appreciation: Money depreciates; only assets like stocks can preserve and increase in value. Currency devaluation is more severe in emerging countries, so it is advised to convert currency into assets. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s low wages and currency devaluation are related to the government\u0026rsquo;s subsidy policies. Worker Mindset vs. Capitalist Mindset: Workers exchange labor for depreciating currency, while capitalists exchange currency for appreciating assets. Learn to invest and become a capitalist, exchanging \u0026ldquo;trash\u0026rdquo; (depreciating currency) for assets. Global Market Linkage: Global markets are highly interconnected, and diversifying investments into other regions has limited effectiveness. Focusing on the US stock market is recommended. Asset Allocation Strategies # Nasdaq 100 Index Funds: The preferred choice for young people. Long-term investment can yield substantial returns. Global codes for purchasing Nasdaq 100 index funds were provided, and investing based on market conditions is recommended. The Importance of Cash: Cash reserves are crucial. 00864B and money market funds (like SWVXX, VOXX) are safeguards and should not be replaced with high-dividend products like SPHD, as principal safety is paramount. Smart Rebalancing: Suitable for those who use leveraged funds, are not retired, and have income. Risks of Real Estate Investment: Housing prices in the Bay Area are high, putting great pressure on young people to buy houses, which can easily lead to financial difficulties. Renting is recommended to maintain flexibility. Borrowing and Investment: Loans, mortgages, and car loans should be repaid with stable cash flow, not relying on stock market returns. Retirement Planning: Retirees should be cautious about borrowing and make plans based on the size of their retirement funds. If retirement funds are 50 times the annual expenses, two options are available: 1. Keep the mortgage and car loan, using 2% of the retirement fund annually to cover all expenses; 2. Pay off the mortgage and car loan, invest 80% of the remaining funds in 00662, 20% in 00864B, and use 2% of the total funds annually for living expenses. Asset Allocation Case Study: A case study with 45 million Taiwan dollars illustrated asset allocation strategies when withdrawals are not needed. An 80/20 allocation or a combination of leveraged funds (60% 00662, 20% 00670L, 20% 00864B) is recommended. For those with stable income and no need to withdraw from investments, 100% investment in QQQ can be considered. Other Matters # Class Suspension Notice: Class is suspended on November 9th and resumes on November 16th. After daylight saving time ends, the class time will be changed to 6:00 AM Pacific Time and 10:00 PM Taiwan time. Stay Optimistic: Maintain an optimistic mindset; the market will reward you. Like, subscribe, and leave comments on various platforms to benefit more people. Contact Information: Two email addresses were provided for contact. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Brian: # Sharing 1: Read \u0026ldquo;Investing is Asset Allocation, What You Don\u0026rsquo;t Know,\u0026rdquo; agreeing with the importance of accumulating the first pot of gold early; learning investment allows for more focus on work and personal improvement, spending time each day learning new skills and increasing self-worth. Investment enables people to be more motivated to improve their professional skills rather than \u0026ldquo;lying flat.\u0026rdquo; Sharing 2: Individuals can improve their earning potential through learning, even if their investment assets are reduced to zero, they can still rely on professional skills to make a comeback. Question 1: What should I do if the Beta value is very low when the asset value plummets in the Excel sheet? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: The sheet is designed for acceleration during market rises and deceleration during falls. A low Beta value is normal and a reflection of risk control; no adjustment is needed. Question 2: Even knowing that investment should be mindless, I still worry when the Beta value drops. How should I cope? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Deceleration during declines is the purpose of the investment strategy. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, stick to the plan, just like autopilot. LU: # Question 1: What is the impact of Trump\u0026rsquo;s potential return to office on Bitcoin? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: The US has abandoned the gold standard and will not adopt a Bitcoin standard. Bitcoin is similar to gold and has an anti-inflationary function, but its future development is limited. Question 2: Can QQQ break through its previous high? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: It definitely can. The current market is bullish; there\u0026rsquo;s no need to worry. Wendy: # Sharing 1: Learned James\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy and successfully recouped the income lost during unemployment. Started reading recommended books such as \u0026ldquo;The Richest Man in Babylon\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The Most Important Thing.\u0026rdquo; No Questions Peter: # Sharing 1: Agrees with James\u0026rsquo;s philosophy and has increased the investment proportion of QQQ, but some individual stocks have not been completely sold due to tax reasons. Question 1: Advantages and disadvantages of converting 401K to Roth 401K? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Just put new contributions into Roth 401K; don\u0026rsquo;t convert existing funds. Convert at retirement. Question 2: How to use HSA and 529 accounts? Is there any problem with using a credit card to pay medical bills from an HSA? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: HSA, 529, and college fund accounts are not recommended because they lead to a loss of control over the funds. Using your own funds or loans is recommended. Question 3: Are there any suggestions for increasing income and saving money besides a full-time job? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Excessive saving is not recommended. Plan for retirement funds first, and the remaining money can be freely used and enjoyed. Yi Jie (First Sister): # Sharing 1: Previously followed the advice of online influencers and invested in US stocks and treasury bonds, currently converting to QQQ. Has a modest salary and one child. Question 1: Can the 20% cash in the 80/20 allocation be replaced with Fubon 50 2X leverage? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: QQQ 2X leverage (00670L) is recommended. He explained the use of leveraged funds. Question 2: Is it feasible to regularly invest equal amounts in QQQ and 2X leverage? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Feasible, but pay attention to cash reserves. A Beta of 1.1 or 1.2 allocation is recommended, adjusting according to market conditions. Question 3: Can a child\u0026rsquo;s Lunar New Year money be all-in on 2X leverage? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: If you can guarantee continuous regular investment for more than 30 years, it\u0026rsquo;s worth considering, but be aware of the risks and be able to withstand significant asset shrinkage. In the long run, the returns can be substantial, but psychological barriers must be overcome. Question 4: Are the views of online influencers recommending treasury bonds correct? Are treasury bonds more valuable during a market crash? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Incorrect. During market downturns, bond declines can be even greater. IAM: # Sharing 1: Reflecting on the value of money, learning gratitude, and paying attention to community articles, realizing that spending money is spending one\u0026rsquo;s life energy. Sharing 2: Made 100 pages of notes and calculated the return on an 80,000 loan invested for 40 years; the result was shocking. Question 1: Why are people not accustomed to borrowing for investment? Confused about the phenomenon of young people being afraid to borrow for investment but willing to use installment plans for consumption. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: This is due to cultural influences. Change your mindset and recognize that good debt can help accumulate wealth. Shared personal experiences and spending philosophy, emphasizing the freedom of spending after becoming wealthy. YJ Yuanlin: # Sharing 1: Investing boosts confidence, enabling focus on work and hobbies. Question 1: In a down year, can TQQ replace QLD in smart rebalancing? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Both are possible, but pay attention to risk control and avoid excessive pursuit of high risk. TQQ has greater volatility and requires a stronger psychological capacity. T: # Question 1: What are your thoughts on Elon Musk supporting Trump? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Politicians\u0026rsquo; decisions are the result of weighing pros and cons. Elon Musk\u0026rsquo;s support for Trump stems from personal interests and positions, such as opposing certain liberal policies. Entrepreneurs also have to choose between different political forces. Yi Ni: # Question 1: How to invest and use Canadian education fund accounts? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to thoroughly research the specific rules of the account and consider methods like pledged loans to avoid locking up funds. Inquired about whether it\u0026rsquo;s possible to withdraw all funds and the limitations, suggesting consulting with professionals. Meng: # Sharing 1: In the high-tech era, privacy and freedom are difficult to have both. Peter: # Sharing 1: It can be difficult for beginners to invest in QQQ, etc. It\u0026rsquo;s suggested to start by buying one share and gradually build confidence. James\u0026rsquo;s explanations are very patient and benefit everyone. Question 1: How to strengthen mental and psychological well-being? James\u0026rsquo;s experience sharing on meditation and hypnosis. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Recommended Rachel\u0026rsquo;s hypnosis channel and shared personal methods of using hypnosis and positive psychological suggestions. Suggested listening to hypnotic audios every night before sleep. IV. Key Takeaways # Rise faster, fall slower. \u0026ndash; James\nThis is one of James\u0026rsquo;s core investment philosophies. Through smart rebalancing strategies, increase investment during market rises to accelerate profits, and reduce investment during market downturns to mitigate losses.\nMoney is the least valuable thing when it has no value. \u0026ndash; James\nThis reflects James\u0026rsquo;s unique view on wealth. When wealth accumulates to a certain extent, the value of money itself is no longer important; what matters more is pursuing freedom and happiness.\nIf you want freedom, and you want privacy, you will not have freedom. In the future world, if you want privacy, you will not have freedom. \u0026ndash; James\nThis shows James\u0026rsquo;s insight into future social trends. In the high-tech era, one needs to make trade-offs between privacy and freedom.\nThe more daring one is to borrow money, the broader their perspective. \u0026ndash; YJ Yuanlin\nYJ Yuanlin\u0026rsquo;s sharing led to James\u0026rsquo;s views on borrowing: good debt can help wealth growth.\nIf you want freedom, you cannot care. \u0026ndash; James\nEchoing the topic of Elon Musk supporting Trump and the entrepreneurial spirit, true freedom is not caring about external opinions and focusing on one\u0026rsquo;s goals.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t use ChatGPT now, you are outdated and will be eliminated. \u0026ndash; James\nJames advocates for new technologies and maintains an open attitude towards learning new things.\nV. Summary # This session covered various aspects of investment philosophy, asset allocation, lifestyle, and how to cope with market fluctuations. James answered the audience\u0026rsquo;s questions with easy-to-understand language and rich examples, sharing his life experiences and insights, and encouraging everyone to stay optimistic, continue learning, and pursue true freedom and happiness.\nDisclaimer: This article is for personal learning notes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Topic of the Day # The session focuses on the impending new highs anticipated in the investment market. James encourages everyone to bolster their investment confidence and enter the market early. He elaborates on various asset allocation strategies, particularly the use of leveraged funds and the significance of cash reserves. Additionally, James dives into the nature of US dollar hegemony and its implications for the global economy. He also shares his thoughts on marriage and childbearing.\nII. Briefing Content # The Market is About to Hit New Highs:\nThe market is on the verge of reaching new highs. Entering early is more advantageous than waiting for the new highs to materialize. Earnings reports from AI and high-tech sectors are projected to surpass expectations. Market funds and corporate profits are also expected to exceed projections. The market consistently trends upward. Investment requires patience; wealth is worth the wait. Interpreting the Asset Portfolio Research Paper:\nLong-term bonds carry higher risks than stocks while yielding lower returns. Investment in them is not recommended. QQQ offers superior returns and risk resistance compared to SPY. Leveraged funds (e.g., QQQ2D) are characterized by high volatility, substantial downside risk, but also significant upside potential. Intelligent asset allocation can achieve returns equivalent to a 100% QQQ portfolio while providing greater cash security. Retirees or individuals without income are advised against using leveraged funds. An 80/20 asset allocation strategy is recommended. Cash is the cornerstone ensuring investors can continue investing. Additional Investment Advice and Experience Sharing:\nRetirees should claim their social security benefits as early as possible and utilize them for investments. Real estate is a liability; selling property for investment purposes is recommended. Avoiding mortgage loans against real estate is advised. Young individuals can leverage credit loans for investments, accelerating wealth accumulation. Exercise prudence in investments. Avoid excessive diversification or venturing into unfamiliar domains such as real estate or REITs. Investing in individual stocks is not advised. Opt for market capitalization-based index funds like QQQ. Experiencing substantial losses is a prerequisite to appreciating the allure of high returns. The market always presents risks, and one must learn to navigate them. Short-term safe assets (e.g., treasury bills) are essential components of an investment portfolio, aiding investors in weathering market fluctuations. The higher the proportion of cash or cash-equivalent assets, the greater the risk tolerance of the investment portfolio. Refrain from self-managing stock portfolios. The returns from most stocks fall short of those from treasury bills. Stock index funds constantly face future risks. Embrace risk tolerance; only by weathering the storms can one see the sunshine. Don\u0026rsquo;t put faith in market predictions. During market downturns, \u0026ldquo;stock gurus\u0026rdquo; often emerge, but their predictions are frequently inaccurate. Adhere to long-term investment principles. Avoid being swayed by short-term market fluctuations. Marriage and Childbearing:\nMarriage serves the purpose of creating life to carry on the universe\u0026rsquo;s legacy. Loving one\u0026rsquo;s partner as one would love their own child is paramount to a successful marriage. Childbearing lies at the heart of life\u0026rsquo;s meaning. Young individuals should marry and have children early, unburdened by financial pressures. Even without marriage, childbearing should be considered. A life spent single and childless will ultimately lead to profound loneliness. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Mike:\nSharing: Mentions the Chinese government\u0026rsquo;s strong push for policies akin to MMT (Modern Monetary Theory). Question 1: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is not included in the Nasdaq 100 index, and the NYSE has extended its trading hours to 22 hours, while Nasdaq hasn\u0026rsquo;t followed suit. Why? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Nasdaq\u0026rsquo;s trading hours are already standard. Extending trading hours only affects after-hours trading, holding little significance for ordinary investors. TSMC\u0026rsquo;s exclusion from the Nasdaq 100 index is linked to factors such as trading costs. Question 2: How can MMT be explained to someone without financial expertise? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: James uses simple language to elucidate the relationship between government deficits and currency issuance. He asserts that governments can cover deficits by printing money without facing national bankruptcy. Using early American history and ancient barter systems as examples, he illustrates how governments utilize currency issuance to purchase goods and services, and how taxation maintains currency value. James emphasizes the essence of US dollar hegemony, highlighting that the US leverages its control over vital resource trading, like oil, to sustain the dollar\u0026rsquo;s global dominance, citing Russia\u0026rsquo;s forced use of dollars for oil purchases as an example. He also points out that the core nature of fiat currency is a representation of national sovereignty, enabling governments to mandate its use through legal means. IAM:\nSharing: Questions whether investing in QQQ also implies supporting \u0026ldquo;rogue\u0026rdquo; entities. After comparing returns from QQQ and its top ten constituent stocks, IAM observed higher returns from the latter, leading to confusion about the role of the remaining 90 companies. Question 1: Does investing in QQQ equate to supporting \u0026ldquo;rogue\u0026rdquo; entities? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: We, as investors, are contributors. Through our investment in QQQ, we allocate capital to the 100 companies making the most significant contributions to humanity, propelling societal progress. Question 2: The top ten constituent stocks of QQQ generate higher returns; what is the purpose of the other 90 companies? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The composition of QQQ\u0026rsquo;s top ten holdings changes annually. Examining solely the past decade\u0026rsquo;s data is insufficient. Companies previously ranked lower have the potential to enter the top ten, underscoring the vital role played by the remaining 90 companies. Question 3: Are companies ranked lower in QQQ\u0026rsquo;s constituents at risk of being removed due to a decrease in their market capitalization percentage? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Typically not, but QQQ mandates that the percentage of any individual constituent stock cannot exceed a specific threshold. Adjustments are made if this limit is surpassed. Question 4: How can one view the complete list of QQQ\u0026rsquo;s constituent companies? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This information can be accessed on websites like Yahoo Finance, which displays QQQ\u0026rsquo;s holdings, or on QQQ\u0026rsquo;s official website. Chunxia:\nSharing: Shares a friend\u0026rsquo;s investment story. This friend works at Apple and previously held steadfast belief in real estate and cash investments. However, recent issues like property taxes have awakened them to the importance of QQQ. Concerns about Apple stock\u0026rsquo;s risk have led them to hesitate about stock pledges. Question: This friend holds a large quantity of Apple stock. How can they convert it into QQQ, and how should they approach a stock pledge? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The maximum long-term capital gains tax is 20%, regardless of income. James recommends that this friend sell a portion of their Apple stock sooner rather than later, converting it into QQQ to mitigate individual stock risk and reduce future tax burdens. A gradual sale of Apple stock is advised, such as selling 10% or 20% each year or only selling the appreciated portion to minimize tax liability. A stock pledge can be utilized for tax payments, for instance, borrowing 20% for tax obligations while reinvesting the remaining funds to enhance investment efficiency. James suggests experimenting with a stock pledge, such as borrowing 2% for personal use, to gain firsthand experience with the convenience of borrowing. He emphasizes the critical role of cash. A higher proportion of cash or cash-equivalent assets translates to greater risk tolerance for the investment portfolio. Jenny:\nSharing: Owns multiple properties but has refrained from selling due to tax deductions and rising rental income. Question 1: Should she sell her properties? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Real estate investments lack the return and liquidity offered by QQQ and potentially face substantial inheritance taxes in the future. Selling the properties is advised. Property taxes, maintenance costs, insurance fees, and more erode the returns from real estate investments. Moreover, real estate is illiquid, requiring time for liquidation. Properties, as inheritance, subject heirs to hefty inheritance taxes, potentially creating an insurmountable financial burden. Question 2: How can she convert to a Roth IRA? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: A Backdoor Roth IRA conversion is an option, involving initially depositing funds into a Traditional IRA and subsequently converting them to a Roth IRA. Question 3: Can property tax deductions and rising rental income offset the costs associated with real estate investment? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The deductible amount for property taxes is limited. Moreover, income from rent increases is subject to income tax and cannot fully offset the costs tied to real estate investment. Question 4: Concerns about mortgages and trusts. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: If a mortgage is obtained under an individual\u0026rsquo;s name, even placing the property within a trust cannot circumvent inheritance taxes. Using an LLC (Limited Liability Company) for property purchase from the outset is recommended, or transferring the property into an irrevocable trust before death to avoid inheritance tax liabilities. Professor Zhou:\nSharing: Shares personal and sibling investment experiences. His sister, after experiencing investment losses, is hesitant to redeem her insurance policy. Jenny, due to returns from real estate investment, is reluctant to sell her properties. This illustrates how investors often fall prey to sunk cost and opportunity cost fallacies. Question: How can we enlighten ourselves and those around us to avoid such investment pitfalls? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Understanding the concepts of sunk cost and opportunity cost is essential. Losses from investments should be cut promptly, avoiding attachment to past investments. Seek superior investment opportunities. While Jenny\u0026rsquo;s real estate investment generates cash flow, its return is low, and it may face high inheritance taxes in the future. Therefore, she should consider selling the property and investing in higher-yielding assets like QQQ. Bart:\nQuestion: Issues connecting to the room. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Recommends force-quitting the app and re-entering the room before raising a hand. Daisy253:\nSharing: New to financial management, past investments were haphazard, primarily focused on real estate and insurance. 45 years old, with an 18-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son, can invest NT$80,000 monthly. NT$10,000 is allocated to children\u0026rsquo;s savings, with the remaining NT$70,000 for personal investment, aiming for rapid asset accumulation to reach NT$10 million. Owns a rental property generating NT$30,000-40,000 in net monthly income, with principal invested ranging from NT$2 to 3 million, and the property valued at NT$3 to 4 million. Children lean towards a \u0026ldquo;non-marriage\u0026rdquo; ideology, expressing no desire for offspring. Question: How should assets be allocated, and how can children be guided towards sound financial management principles? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Suggests referencing the article James provided, titled \u0026ldquo;Individuals Still Some Time Away from Retirement,\u0026rdquo; and adopting a BETA 1.2 asset allocation strategy. Advises against giving children excessive funds at present. Instead, encourage them to save independently once they have a stable income, guiding them to establish proper financial management habits. Proposes incentivizing children to marry and have children by offering NT$1 million annually in the future. Emphasizes that 00864B cannot be replaced by 0056. Cash is cash and should not be substituted with stocks. Underscores the significance of marriage and childbearing, advising early marriage and parenthood, urging them not to be bound by financial anxieties. Xie Weiya:\nSharing: Recounts the story of a friend working at Apple. This friend steadfastly believed in real estate and cash as investments but recently recognized the importance of QQQ due to concerns like property taxes. However, they remain apprehensive about the risks associated with Apple stock and hesitate to engage in stock pledges. This friend maintains a high spending level but undoubtedly possesses the financial capacity for retirement. They simply derive great enjoyment from work. The friend has already contacted Lisa and is preparing for a stock pledge. Question: This friend holds a substantial amount of Apple stock. How can they convert it into QQQ, and how should they approach a stock pledge? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The maximum long-term capital gains tax is 20%, independent of income. James recommends selling a portion of their Apple stock as soon as possible, converting it to QQQ to mitigate individual stock risk and reduce future tax burdens. A gradual sale of Apple stock is advised, such as 10% or 20% each year, or selling only the appreciated portion to minimize tax liability. Utilizing a stock pledge for tax payments is suggested, such as borrowing 20% for tax obligations while reinvesting the remaining funds to enhance investment efficiency. James encourages them to experiment with a stock pledge, perhaps borrowing 2% for personal use, to experience the convenience of borrowing firsthand. He highlights the vital role of cash. A higher proportion of cash or cash-equivalent assets translates to greater risk tolerance for the investment portfolio. James advises this friend to learn from investment approaches employed by individuals like Warren Buffett and Wei Ying-ch’ung, leveraging credit for investment purposes. Sunny:\nQuestion: How should labor pension funds be withdrawn? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: If proficient in investment, withdrawing the entire labor pension fund at once and investing it in high-yielding assets like QQQ is recommended. Wu Liyun:\nQuestion: Is NT$5 million in stocks and cash sufficient for retirement? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: NT$5 million in assets is insufficient to support a comfortable retirement. Withdrawing a labor pension monthly to supplement retirement income is recommended. Nana:\nQuestion: Concerns regarding genetic screening. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Genetic screening is recommended to identify any potential genetic defects. College Student:\nQuestion: Concerns about Backdoor Roth IRA. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: College students, lacking income, do not require a Backdoor Roth IRA. Directly depositing funds into a Roth IRA is suitable. Jessie:\nSharing: Has 1099 income. Question: Can 1099 income be deposited into a Traditional IRA? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Yes, 1099 income is eligible for deposit into a Traditional IRA. Additionally, a Backdoor Roth IRA can be executed using a spouse\u0026rsquo;s W2 income. IV. Key Takeaways # Young individuals should be bold in using borrowed funds for investment to accelerate wealth accumulation. \u0026ndash; James\nYoung people are in their prime earning years, with steadily increasing income. They can utilize tools like credit loans to access low-cost capital for investing in high-return assets like QQQ, thereby speeding up their wealth-building journey.\nCash is the cornerstone ensuring investors can continue investing. \u0026ndash; James\nMarket volatility is a constant. Maintaining sufficient cash or cash-equivalent assets helps investors navigate market fluctuations with ease, preventing panic-driven asset sales, ultimately achieving long-term investment objectives.\nExercise prudence in investments. Avoid excessive diversification or venturing into unfamiliar domains. \u0026ndash; James\nFocus investments within familiar areas. Refrain from blindly pursuing diversification or investing in unfamiliar domains, such as real estate or REITs.\nThe essence of US dollar hegemony lies in the US leveraging its control over vital resource trading, like oil, to sustain the dollar\u0026rsquo;s global dominance. \u0026ndash; James\nBy mandating US dollar settlements for global oil transactions, the US compels other nations to hold dollar reserves, solidifying its global currency dominance.\nMarriage serves the purpose of creating life to carry on the universe\u0026rsquo;s legacy. Loving one\u0026rsquo;s partner as one would love their own child is paramount to a successful marriage. \u0026ndash; James\nThe significance of marriage lies in procreation and the continuation of life. Loving one\u0026rsquo;s partner deeply, treating them as one would treat their own child, is crucial for a lasting and fulfilling marriage.\nChildbearing lies at the heart of life\u0026rsquo;s meaning. Young individuals should marry and have children early, unburdened by financial pressures. \u0026ndash; James\nChildbearing is inherent to human nature and the perpetuation of life. Young people should courageously embrace the responsibility of parenthood, refusing to be deterred by financial concerns.\nInvestors often fall prey to sunk cost and opportunity cost fallacies. \u0026ndash; Professor Zhou\nSunk costs refer to incurred expenses that are irretrievable, such as purchased stocks or real estate. Opportunity cost represents the potential gains foregone by choosing one investment over other available options. During decision-making, investors should not be swayed by sunk costs; instead, they should prioritize opportunity cost, selecting investments offering higher returns.\nV. Conclusion # This session revolves around the anticipated new highs in the investment market. James encourages listeners to solidify their investment confidence and enter the market promptly. He meticulously explains various asset allocation strategies, emphasizing the use of leveraged funds and the paramount importance of cash reserves. He also delves into the nature of US dollar hegemony and its global economic implications, sharing his personal views on marriage and childbearing. The Q\u0026amp;A segment addresses questions encompassing asset allocation, stock pledges, retirement planning, investment strategies, and more, making it a content-rich and insightful session.\nDisclaimer: This article is for personal learning purposes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Topic # Trust in the power of technology and maintain a long-term investment strategy focused on Nasdaq 100 index funds, learning how to utilize stock pledging and spend wisely, especially during market fluctuations and shifts in the international situation.\nII. Presentation Content # Market Trends and Investment Philosophy: AI Drives the Future: AI demand is not a bubble, but a genuine driving force behind technological advancement, promising a bull market spanning two decades. We are currently in the early stages of this growth. Morris Chang (TSMC Chairman)\u0026rsquo;s perspective and TSMC\u0026rsquo;s investments in AI corroborate this judgment. The long bull market has begun, seize the opportunity to join the wealth train. Market Volatility and Long-Term Investment: Market fluctuations are inherent to investing. Downswings are followed by even greater upswings. Using historical data from the Taiwan Weighted Index, Nikkei Index, and the US stock market as examples, the session illustrates the long-term market development pattern: an initial period of rapid growth followed by a period of stagnation (e.g., 32 years in Taiwan, 35 years in Japan, 24 years in the US), before entering a phase of stable growth. Therefore, overcoming panic caused by market volatility and adhering to a long-term investment strategy is crucial for ultimate success. Capitalism and Investment: The side effects of capitalism are wealth disparity and the exploitation of labor. Learn to operate like a capitalist and profit from investment. Hard work and saving money to buy government bonds will ultimately result in wealth erosion due to inflation. Benefits of Quantitative Easing: Quantitative easing is beneficial for investors, fostering a low-interest-rate environment and driving asset price appreciation. Those who fail to understand quantitative easing and complain about government money printing are often victims of capitalism, missing out on the benefits of asset appreciation. Characteristics of a Mature Market: Mature markets are characterized by fair, just, and transparent regulatory mechanisms, companies focused on their core businesses, and a high proportion of long-term investors and institutional holdings. The Taiwanese market is gradually maturing. Investment Strategies and Recommendations: Invest in Nasdaq 100: The session recommends investing in Nasdaq 100 index funds (QQQ), with the option to allocate to S\u0026amp;P 500 or high-dividend ETFs based on individual circumstances. References to Nasdaq 100 index funds globally are provided for the convenience of investors worldwide. Avoid Penny Stocks: Refrain from investing in penny stocks, as they generally offer low long-term returns. Real investment opportunities lie in companies that demonstrate sustained growth and lead technological advancements. Advantages of Stock Pledging: Stock pledging offers advantages over real estate mortgages, as stocks, unlike real estate, do not depreciate and can be held long-term, potentially allowing for \u0026ldquo;borrowing without repayment or interest\u0026rdquo; (specific instructions are available in related videos). Avoid Flawed Rebalancing Strategies: Avoid a 50% principal + 50% leveraged ETF rebalancing strategy, as it carries high risk and can easily deplete cash reserves during market downturns. Estate Planning and Stock Pledging: When engaging in stock pledging, it is advisable to diversify assets across multiple brokerage firms, pledging a portion and keeping the rest as cash to facilitate estate handling for inheritors. Cat supplemented this with a detailed explanation of the stock pledging inheritance process, emphasizing the importance of advance planning. Other Important Matters: Risk Warning and Disclaimer: The content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. Do not remit funds to unknown accounts. Program Format Adjustment: The presentation content will be expanded to include material previously covered in short videos. QQQ Stock Selection Mechanism: Addresses audience questions regarding the QQQ stock selection mechanism, explaining the advantages of the Nasdaq exchange and why technology companies prefer listing on Nasdaq. Stock Pledging for Non-US Residents: Explains the regulations for non-US residents engaging in stock pledging with US brokers. Learning to Spend: Shares the philosophy of spending after achieving investment success, emphasizing the importance of focusing on future wealth growth and utilizing financial leverage for consumption. Don\u0026rsquo;t let wealth sit idle; learn how to use it. This point is illustrated with the example of a listener who has $4 million but doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how to spend it, calculating their potential wealth growth over 40 years and a reasonable spending level. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IAM:\nShared: Expressed confusion about different types of economic crises and how the 2020-2023 pandemic period compares to previous bubbles after reading a book about economic crises. Question 1: Which historical economic crisis is most similar to the economic downturn during the 2020-2023 pandemic? Answer: The 2020-2023 pandemic was an economic shock caused by an external event, distinct from previous bubble economies. The 2000 dot-com bubble was an industry bubble with limited impact; the 2008 financial crisis resembled the 1929 Great Depression, both being asset bubble bursts, but the 2008 crisis recovered faster due to quantitative easing. The 2022 market decline was not a bubble burst, but a revaluation caused by central bank interest rate hikes. Question 2: What did the US do to stimulate the economy that other countries couldn\u0026rsquo;t replicate? Answer: The US is less constrained by fiscal discipline and is willing to borrow and issue debt, allocating funds to social welfare programs for the elderly, children, and healthcare, while guiding domestic capital towards overseas investment to mitigate inflation. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s government was advised to learn from the US\u0026rsquo;s fiscal spending approach and guide capital towards investment, while also focusing on efficient capital utilization and building a social safety net. Question 3: Why are Chinese people so keen on buying houses? Answer: This is a vestige of the agrarian \u0026ldquo;land is wealth\u0026rdquo; mentality, which is no longer applicable today. Eason (Doctor):\nShared: Points to consider for Chinese investors buying Nasdaq ETFs: Different brokerage firms have different fee policies and financing rates; careful comparison is necessary. Domestic Nasdaq ETFs have premiums; buying during periods of low or negative premiums is recommended. There are no limits for buying ETFs on the exchange, but there are limits for off-exchange subscriptions. Recommends allocating a portion of assets to USD-denominated investments like QQQ, which can be purchased by opening brokerage accounts in Singapore or Hong Kong. Added: Chinese residents have a $50,000 annual foreign exchange quota for overseas investments. Hong Kong and mainland China identities have different withholding tax rates on US stock investments. Dave:\nQuestion 1: Will the Nasdaq 100 index become stagnant like the Dow Jones index? Answer: Currently, the Nasdaq 100 is the most competitive; excessive worry about the future is unnecessary. Question 2: Is it feasible to only buy the top 10 companies in the Nasdaq 100 index? Answer: The top ten companies change frequently; individual stock selection and portfolio adjustments are too cumbersome, and returns may not be higher. Investing directly in index funds is more efficient. Question 3: How do VGT and XLK compare to QQQ? Answer: VGT and XLK track different indices than QQQ, with different constituent stocks and concentration. QQQ is more robust and has broader coverage. Jiawen:\nQuestion: Can an 80% leveraged ETF + 10% cash + 10% bond portfolio be directly pledged? How is this done? Answer: Yes, but a small-scale trial is recommended, for instance, borrowing $200,000 against $5 million in principal, or borrowing within $1 million against $10 million. Long-term borrowing strategies should be adjusted according to circumstances. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to pledge only a portion of the stocks, leaving the remainder for additional purchases or other uses. Peter:\nShared: Personal investment journey, transitioning from real estate to stocks, learning about stock pledging and asset allocation. Question: Is there synergy between real estate and stock investment? How can real estate cash flow be used for stock investment? Answer: Buying a house is not recommended for young people. Real estate investment returns are lower than stocks and come with various risks (e.g., natural disasters, property taxes). Even with positive cash flow, opportunity costs should be considered; investing that capital in stocks might yield higher returns. Used Texas real estate as an example to illustrate the drawbacks of real estate investment. Qiu Xiao:\nQuestion 1: What are the Canadian equivalents of US retirement accounts like IRA, Roth IRA, and 401k? Which account should cash be held in? Answer: Roth IRA corresponds to Canada\u0026rsquo;s TFSA, Traditional IRA to RRSP, and 401k to DCPP. The choice of retirement account for cash depends on the individual\u0026rsquo;s balance between taxable and tax-free accounts and their asset allocation strategy. One should choose to place cash in either a tax-free or taxable account based on their specific circumstances for tax optimization. Question 2 (Related to Eason\u0026rsquo;s question): How can one invest in Nasdaq ETFs in China, and how can quota limitations be addressed? Answer: Off-exchange subscriptions have quota limits, while on-exchange ETF purchases do not, but premiums should be considered. Opening multiple brokerage accounts or opening an account in Hong Kong for US stock investment can be considered. Haoqing:\nShared: Used the example of SpaceX launching rockets with a small team to highlight concerns about AI replacing human labor and the difficulties young people face in finding employment. Question: How can we address the challenge of youth unemployment in the AI era? Answer: Young people need to acquire AI skills to adapt to the future job market. Recommends that schools incorporate AI courses into their core curriculum, cultivating AI talent from a young age. Philosophy is an important foundational subject but should not be a primary career focus. Jimmy:\nShared: Discussed the changing times and the need for young people to adapt, sharing observations about the youthful demographics of Xiamen. Mentioned the importance of aligning investments with the times and shared some common misunderstandings about investing he had encountered. Question: What are your views on index fund investing? Is the long-term return of 0050 sufficient? What are your thoughts on individual stock investing (e.g., TSMC)? Answer: Index fund investing is a method accessible to the general public, but many don\u0026rsquo;t understand it and require time and experience to appreciate it. In the long run, QQQ and SPY offer higher returns and are more suitable for long-term investment. Individual stock picking demands specialized knowledge and skills and carries higher risks; it is difficult for average investors to select and hold high-quality stocks like TSMC for the long term. The key to investing is finding investment targets that can be held long-term and sticking with them. Other Q\u0026amp;A:\nTQQQ Pledging: Learn about stock pledging and how to achieve interest-free borrowing through the recommended videos. Top 10 QQQ Holdings: Frequent trading is discouraged; holding the index fund long-term is sufficient. BOX vs. SWVXX: BOX is recommended for brokerage accounts to avoid dividend taxes. Conservative Investing: Conservative investing can involve holding cash or holding index funds long-term. How to Spend Money: Focus on future wealth growth and utilize financial leverage for consumption. Investing in US Stocks from within China: Coming to the US to invest or remitting funds to the US for investment is recommended. Consider opening an account in Hong Kong or using other compliant channels for investment. IV. Key Takeaways # AI demand is not a bubble; technological advancements will drive a bull market lasting 20 years. We are just at the beginning. \u0026ndash; James\nJames emphasizes his belief that AI is a long-term trend and encourages investors to recognize the current market as the starting point of a significant bull run.\nHigh returns are meaningless if the probability of success is low. \u0026ndash; James\nJames reiterates that a successful investment strategy prioritizes long-term holding and consistency over chasing high returns with low success rates.\nYoung people need to learn AI skills to adapt to the future job market. AI courses should be core curriculum in all departments. \u0026ndash; James\nJames stresses the importance of acquiring AI skills for future employment and advocates for integrating AI education into all academic disciplines.\nEarning money is easy; spending it wisely is difficult. Don\u0026rsquo;t let your wealth sit idle; learn how to use it. \u0026ndash; James\nJames offers a unique perspective on wealth management, urging listeners to become skilled spenders and maximize their wealth\u0026rsquo;s potential.\nGovernments should invest in the elderly and children, building a strong social safety net. \u0026ndash; James\nJames underscores the importance of social welfare, suggesting that nations prioritize investing in the well-being of their youngest and oldest citizens.\nV. Summary # This session centers on long-term investment in the Nasdaq 100 index fund, covering market trends, investment strategies, the use of financial leverage, and personal development in the AI era. James not only shares professional investment concepts and techniques but also encourages listeners to shift their mindsets, embrace the opportunities presented by technological advancements, and learn how to better manage and utilize their wealth. He also emphasizes the government\u0026rsquo;s responsibility in social welfare development, advocating for a more robust social safety net to protect the well-being of the elderly and children. Furthermore, the session addresses the needs of Chinese investors by answering questions about accessing US markets from China and related tax implications.\nDisclaimer: This article is for personal learning notes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Summary # The core idea of this book is how to achieve investment returns that surpass the market average. The author argues that achieving this goal requires \u0026ldquo;second-level thinking,\u0026rdquo; which is deeper and more comprehensive than the thinking of ordinary investors. He emphasizes contrarian investing, being greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy. The book elaborates on important concepts such as market efficiency, value assessment, risk identification and control, cyclical and pendulum awareness, investor psychology, and diversified investment. It also provides a wealth of practical experience and case studies, aiming to help investors establish a sound thinking framework and control the impact of emotions on investment decisions.\nII. Chapter Summaries # Second-Level Thinking: To outperform the market, one must engage in second-level thinking, which requires investors to think more deeply and comprehensively, not being satisfied with simple conclusions, but considering various possibilities, probabilities, market consensus, and their own cognitive biases. For example, first-level thinking might conclude, \u0026ldquo;This is a good company, so I should buy it,\u0026rdquo; while second-level thinking would consider, \u0026ldquo;While it\u0026rsquo;s a good company, has the market already overreacted, pushing the price too high?\u0026rdquo;\nUnderstanding Market Efficiency and Its Limitations: Markets are not perfectly efficient; there are opportunities for mispricing. However, due to the large number of investors competing, beating the market remains very difficult. Markets are efficient at incorporating information, but they don\u0026rsquo;t always interpret that information correctly. Investors should focus on relatively inefficient markets, such as those that are less followed, have opaque information, or are controversial.\nValue Assessment: The foundation of value investing is accurate estimation of intrinsic value, which requires considering factors such as a company\u0026rsquo;s financial position, management capabilities, profitability, competitive advantages, and future growth prospects. The author emphasizes that value investing focuses more on present value, while growth investing emphasizes future value, but both require considering the future.\nThe Relationship Between Price and Value: Successful investing is not about \u0026ldquo;buying good things,\u0026rdquo; but about \u0026ldquo;buying things well,\u0026rdquo; which means buying at a price below intrinsic value. Price is influenced by value, psychology, and technical factors. Investors need to understand the relationship between these three to make sound investment decisions. Buying a good company at a high price can still lead to losses, while buying a lower-quality asset at a low price can yield high returns.\nUnderstanding Risk: Risk is not volatility, but the possibility of permanent loss of capital. It\u0026rsquo;s crucial to understand the various forms of risk, such as failing to meet objectives, underperformance, career risk, and liquidity risk. Risk is subjective and difficult to quantify, depending on the investor\u0026rsquo;s specific circumstances and goals.\nRecognizing Risk: Risk often increases when market optimism is high and prices are inflated. Be wary of the \u0026ldquo;no risk\u0026rdquo; narrative and recognize signs of an overheated market, such as high P/E ratios, narrow credit spreads, and loose credit conditions.\nControlling Risk: Risk control is more important than taking risks. Control risk through diversification, limiting risk exposure, adhering to a margin of safety, and avoiding excessive leverage. The results of risk control are often invisible because they manifest in losses avoided.\nFocusing on Cycles: Everything is cyclical. Recognize the inevitability of cyclical fluctuations and look for opportunities at cyclical extremes. The author uses the credit cycle as an example to illustrate how cycles are self-correcting and how investors can find opportunities within them.\nPendulum Awareness: Investor psychology swings like a pendulum between optimism and pessimism, greed and fear. Recognize the patterns of this swing and act contrarianly at extremes. Market extremes often represent turning points and opportunities.\nResisting Negative Influences: Resist the influence of negative emotions such as greed, fear, herd mentality, envy, and ego on investment decisions. Recognizing the existence of these psychological factors and striving to overcome them is crucial for making rational investment decisions.\nContrarian Investing: Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy. Contrarian investing is not simply doing the opposite of the crowd; it requires independent thinking and judgment, as well as a deep understanding of value. Contrarian investing can be lonely and unsettling but is key to achieving superior returns.\nFinding Bargains: Bargains often appear in unpopular and unfavored assets, such as those with apparent flaws, misunderstood by the market, or overlooked.\nWaiting Patiently for Opportunities: Don\u0026rsquo;t chase opportunities; wait patiently for them to come to you. Investors should be like baseball hitters, waiting for the perfect pitch instead of swinging blindly.\nRecognizing the Limitations of Forecasting: Predicting the future is very difficult. Recognize the limitations of forecasting and focus on knowable factors, such as company fundamentals and industry trends.\nUnderstanding Your Position in the Cycle: Understand your position within the market cycle and adjust your investment strategy accordingly. Investors can assess market conditions by observing investor behavior, the credit environment, and valuation levels.\nAppreciating the Role of Luck: Investment outcomes are influenced by luck. Distinguish between skill and luck, and avoid being blinded by short-term success. Investors should focus on long-term performance and analyze the sources of returns, rather than just focusing on short-term gains.\nDiversification: Diversification is an important risk management tool, but understand correlations and avoid ineffective diversification. True diversification means holding assets that behave differently under different market conditions.\nAvoiding Mistakes: Avoiding major mistakes is more important than pursuing great success. Identify and avoid various types of errors, such as analytical errors, psychological errors, and failure to recognize cycles and market sentiment.\nThe Significance of Value Creation: Value creation requires superior investment skill. Understand alpha and beta, and strive for asymmetric investment performance, meaning achieving higher returns when the market rises and suffering fewer losses when the market falls.\nReasonable Expectations: Set reasonable return expectations and avoid being misled by unrealistic expectations. Excessively high return expectations are often accompanied by excessive risk. Understand how returns are generated and the conditions required to achieve objectives.\nThe Most Important Thing: Summarizes the core ideas of the book, emphasizing the importance of value assessment, risk control, contrarian investing, and psychological factors. Successful investing requires comprehensive consideration of these factors and the development of a complete investment framework.\nIII. Key Takeaways # \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a certain irony in the investing world: What\u0026rsquo;s obvious to everyone else is likely to be wrong.\u0026rdquo;\nInsight: Consensus views often lead to average results, at best. Superior returns require non-consensus views that prove to be correct.\n\u0026ldquo;Remember, your goal in investing isn\u0026rsquo;t to earn average returns; you want to do better than average.\u0026rdquo;\nInsight: Complacency is the enemy of superior performance. Strive to exceed benchmarks, not simply match them.\n\u0026ldquo;The widespread belief that there\u0026rsquo;s no risk is the biggest risk of all.\u0026rdquo;\nInsight: When markets are universally optimistic, risk is often at its highest because prices don\u0026rsquo;t reflect potential problems.\n\u0026ldquo;Only when the tide goes out do you discover who\u0026rsquo;s been swimming naked.\u0026rdquo;\nInsight: Adverse market conditions reveal the weaknesses in portfolios and investment strategies that were hidden during favorable periods.\n\u0026ldquo;It takes greatest courage, but provides the greatest profit, to buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are greedily buying.\u0026rdquo;\nInsight: Contrarian investing is difficult because it requires going against the crowd, but it offers the potential for the highest rewards.\n\u0026ldquo;One of the great things about investing is that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to make a lot of good decisions to do well. What\u0026rsquo;s essential is avoiding bad decisions.\u0026rdquo;\nInsight: Preserving capital is paramount. Avoiding significant losses has a greater impact on long-term returns than occasional big wins.\n\u0026ldquo;An investor needs do very few things right as long as he avoids big mistakes.\u0026rdquo;\nInsight: Risk management and capital preservation are the cornerstones of successful investing.\nIV. Practical Application # This book provides a comprehensive investment framework to help investors:\nEstablish a sound investment philosophy: Emphasizes the importance of value investing, contrarian investing, and risk control. Improve investment skills: Learn how to assess value, identify risks, control emotions, and construct portfolios. Cultivate a healthy investment mindset: Remain rational, objective, patient, and think independently, avoiding being swayed by market sentiment.

Summary # This book unveils the real lives of American millionaires through a comprehensive survey, shattering the mystique surrounding them. The authors discovered that most American millionaires were not born with a silver spoon but built their wealth from scratch through frugality, hard work, self-discipline, and smart investing. The book also explores the definition of wealth, how to accumulate it, how to raise children, and how to distribute inheritance, offering a practical guide for those who aspire to build wealth.\nII. Chapter Summaries # Chapter 1: Meet the Millionaire Next Door # This chapter introduces the authors\u0026rsquo; motivation and methodology for surveying millionaires and paints a typical picture of an American millionaire: they are mostly self-made entrepreneurs who live frugally and focus on investment rather than conspicuous consumption. Through analyzing affluent individuals from diverse racial backgrounds and professions, the authors reveal the relationship between wealth accumulation and factors like racial origin and career choices, emphasizing the crucial role of \u0026ldquo;frugality\u0026rdquo; in wealth building. The authors introduce the concept of \u0026ldquo;Big Hat, No Cattle,\u0026rdquo; referring to the phenomenon that many who appear to be millionaires are not truly wealthy, while many genuine millionaires live modest, frugal lives. Chapter 2: Frugality: The Cornerstone of Wealth Building # This chapter delves into the theme of \u0026ldquo;frugality,\u0026rdquo; highlighting it as the foundation of wealth accumulation. By comparing the lifestyles and consumption habits of \u0026ldquo;Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAWs)\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Under Accumulators of Wealth (UAWs),\u0026rdquo; the authors demonstrate the decisive impact of frugality on wealth accumulation. For instance, the contrasting cases of Mr. Ford, a lawyer with high spending habits, and Mr. Richards, a mobile home dealer who lived frugally, ultimately show that Mr. Richards accumulated almost five times the wealth of Mr. Ford. This chapter points out that most American millionaires are first-generation affluent individuals who practice a lifestyle of saving more than they spend, refraining from splurging on luxury items like expensive clothing, watches, and cars. They accumulate wealth but maintain a moderately frugal lifestyle. This chapter also introduces a crucial wealth formula: Age multiplied by realized pretax annual household income, divided by 10, minus inherited wealth, equals your expected net worth. Using this formula, readers can calculate their expected net worth and assess whether they are PAWs, UAWs, or \u0026ldquo;Average Accumulators of Wealth (AAWs).\u0026rdquo; Chapter 3: Time, Energy, and Money # This chapter explores the importance of efficiently allocating \u0026ldquo;time, energy, and money\u0026rdquo; for wealth accumulation. By comparing how PAWs and UAWs allocate these three resources, the chapter illustrates that PAWs prioritize long-term planning, investment strategies, and risk management, while UAWs tend towards instant gratification, impulsive spending, and a lack of financial planning. This chapter emphasizes the importance of household budgeting, stating that even high earners need to meticulously plan and control expenses to accumulate wealth. The authors point out that PAWs spend significantly more time on financial planning than UAWs, and PAWs prefer to invest in appreciating assets like stocks and real estate, while UAWs tend to spend their money on consumer goods. The authors advise readers to manage their household finances like a business, creating a budget, controlling expenses, and regularly reviewing investment plans. Chapter 4: You Aren\u0026rsquo;t What You Drive # This chapter uses the car-buying habits of millionaires as an example to further illustrate the principle that \u0026ldquo;being financially independent is more important than displaying high social status.\u0026rdquo; The authors categorize millionaire car buyers into four types: \u0026ldquo;New-Car Dealers\u0026rsquo; Conservatives,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;New-Car Shoppers,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Used-Car Dealers\u0026rsquo; Conservatives,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Used-Car Shoppers.\u0026rdquo; By analyzing the purchasing behaviors of these four types, the authors find that \u0026ldquo;Used-Car Shoppers\u0026rdquo; are the most frugal, highly price-sensitive, and adept at leveraging various channels to find the best deals. This group is also the most likely to become PAWs. This chapter also notes that most millionaires buy American-made cars, and many buy used cars. They believe that cars are depreciating assets and there\u0026rsquo;s no need to spend excessively on new ones. Chapter 5: Economic Outpatient Care # This chapter explores the phenomenon of \u0026ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care,\u0026rdquo; where parents provide substantial financial assistance to their adult children, often leading to the children\u0026rsquo;s lack of financial independence and drive, ultimately hindering their ability to accumulate wealth. By comparing the wealth accumulation of children who receive \u0026ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care\u0026rdquo; with those who don\u0026rsquo;t, the authors illustrate the negative impact of this practice. For example, the case of Rama and Mary, a couple who received long-term financial support from Mary\u0026rsquo;s parents, ultimately developed high spending habits and failed to accumulate wealth. This chapter analyzes the causes of \u0026ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care\u0026rdquo; and offers suggestions to help affluent parents avoid the tragedy of \u0026ldquo;shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations.\u0026rdquo; For instance, parents should teach their children frugality and financial management instead of solely providing financial aid. This chapter points out that adult children who receive gifts from their parents generally perform worse in wealth accumulation compared to those who don\u0026rsquo;t. This is because receiving gifts can foster dependence and a tendency to spend the money on consumption rather than investment. Chapter 6: Rules of Thumb # This chapter discusses how affluent parents distribute wealth to their adult children and how they choose heirs. The authors note that affluent parents often distribute wealth based on their children\u0026rsquo;s professions, gender, and contributions to the family, tending to leave more to children who need financial assistance. For instance, homemakers often receive more inheritance than working children. This chapter also emphasizes the importance of choosing executors and suggests that affluent parents select an experienced professional as a co-executor to prevent inheritance disputes among children. This chapter offers advice to help affluent parents avoid family conflicts when distributing inheritance. For example, affluent parents should establish estate plans early and communicate with their children to ensure their wishes are understood. Chapter 7: Affirmative Action, Family Style # This chapter explores the business opportunities in providing products and services to the wealthy, noting that these opportunities will continue to grow with the increasing affluent population. The authors list several businesses and professions that can benefit from serving the wealthy, including specialized lawyers, healthcare and dental specialists, estate liquidators, educational institutions and professionals, and real estate experts. The authors also analyze the spending habits of the wealthy and point out that they are willing to spend on certain aspects, such as investment consulting, healthcare, and education, which provides significant business opportunities for many industries. Chapter 8: The Perfect Investment # This chapter discusses the relationship between career choice and wealth accumulation, pointing out that self-employed business owners and professionals are more likely to build wealth. By comparing the profitability and risks of different professions, the authors illustrate why self-employed business owners and professionals are more likely to accumulate wealth. For example, the average profit margin of a doctor\u0026rsquo;s office is higher than that of a coal mining operation. This chapter also analyzes why affluent parents often discourage their children from taking over family businesses and instead recommend pursuing careers as self-employed professionals. This is because self-employed professionals can leverage their knowledge and skills to generate sustainable income, and their careers tend to be more stable and less risky. III. Key Quotes # \u0026ldquo;Wealth is not the same as income. If you make a good income each year and spend it all, you are not getting wealthier. You are just living high. Wealth is what you accumulate, not what you spend.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote highlights the book\u0026rsquo;s core message: wealth accumulation is not solely based on high income but also relies on frugal habits and smart investment skills. High income doesn\u0026rsquo;t equate to wealth; only by converting income into assets can one achieve true financial freedom.\n\u0026ldquo;Frugality is the cornerstone of wealth building.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote emphasizes the crucial role of frugality in wealth accumulation. Only by controlling consumption can one free up more funds for investment, leading to wealth growth. Frugality doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean living an austere life but rather being a rational consumer and avoiding unnecessary waste.\n\u0026ldquo;To build wealth, minimize your realized (taxable) income and maximize your unrealized income (wealth that is not taxed until it is converted to cash).\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote reveals a vital strategy for wealthy individuals to accumulate wealth, namely, achieving wealth growth through investment rather than solely relying on salary income. One must skillfully utilize tax policies to convert income into tax-advantaged assets like stocks and real estate.\n\u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re not yet wealthy but want to be someday, never purchase a home that requires a mortgage that is more than twice your household\u0026rsquo;s total annual realized income.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote offers practical advice for those in the early stages of wealth accumulation: avoid excessive mortgage burdens and allocate more funds towards investment. When funds are limited, prioritize investment over consumption.\n\u0026ldquo;Those who are financially independent are considerably happier than those in the same income/age cohort who are not financially secure.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote illustrates the importance of financial security for personal happiness. Possessing sufficient wealth allows individuals to face life\u0026rsquo;s challenges with greater confidence. Economic independence is the foundation of personal freedom and a crucial guarantee of happiness.\n\u0026ldquo;Never tell children that their parents are wealthy.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote provides valuable educational advice for affluent parents: avoid letting children know about the family\u0026rsquo;s wealth too early to prevent them from developing dependence and a lack of initiative. Children need to understand that wealth is created through their own efforts.\n\u0026ldquo;No matter how wealthy you are, teach your children to be self-sufficient and frugal.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote emphasizes the importance of frugality and self-discipline. Even children from affluent families should develop good habits to better adapt to future challenges. Children need to understand that frugality is a virtue and a prerequisite for success.\nIV.

Content Summary # This book is divided into two parts: saving and investing. The saving section covers all aspects of saving money, including how much to save, how to save more, and how to spend money without guilt. The investing section covers many aspects of making money with money, including why you should invest, what you should invest in, and how often you should invest. The author answers the most common questions in the field of personal finance and investing, with each chapter exploring a topic in depth and providing practical tips. Using a large amount of data and empirical research as evidence, the author arrives at reliable ways to save money and build wealth.\nII. Chapter Summary # Chapter 1. Where Should You Start? # The poor should focus on saving, and the rich should focus on investing.\nRecent graduates should focus on increasing their income and savings rate, rather than obsessing over investment decisions, because the growth rate of savings far exceeds the growth rate of investment. People who have accumulated a certain amount of wealth should spend more time thinking about the details of their investment plan. The author proposes a \u0026ldquo;Save-Invest continuum\u0026rdquo; concept to help you determine your current financial focus: calculate your expected savings and expected investment growth. Focus on whichever is greater. Chapter 2. How Much Should You Save? # You probably need to save less than you think.\nMany saving recommendations are based on false assumptions: that people\u0026rsquo;s incomes are stable and that everyone has the ability to achieve the same savings rate. In fact, incomes become more unstable over time, and the biggest determinant of an individual\u0026rsquo;s savings rate is their income level. The best saving advice is: save what you can save. A large body of evidence suggests that retirees generally don\u0026rsquo;t spend enough, with many even increasing their financial assets after retirement. Today\u0026rsquo;s younger generation is not creating wealth any slower than previous generations, so there is no need to worry too much about running out of money after retirement. Chapter 3. How to Save More Money? # The biggest lie in personal finance: you can get rich just by saving.\nThe effectiveness of reducing spending is limited. For low-income people, spending is already at its lowest level, making it difficult to reduce further. The author uses data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey to support this point. Increasing income is more effective than reducing spending because as income increases, spending does not necessarily increase proportionately (diminishing marginal utility). The author calls this the \u0026ldquo;law of the stomach.\u0026rdquo; Five ways to increase your income: Sell your time/expertise: easy to do, but not scalable. Sell a skill/service: higher income, but takes time to develop skills. Teach: easy to scale, but highly competitive. Sell a product: scalable, but requires a lot of upfront investment and ongoing marketing efforts. Climb the career ladder: traditional but effective, can gain skills, experience and stable income growth. The most reliable way to get rich is: Increase your income and invest in income-producing assets. Chapter 4. How to Spend Money Without Guilt? # Most financial advice uses guilt to make you question your spending decisions, causing you to be overly nervous about spending money. Two tips to help you make financial decisions without worry and spend money without guilt: The 2x rule: When you splurge, invest the same amount of money in income-producing assets or donate it to charity. For example, if you want to buy a pair of $400 shoes, buy $400 worth of stock at the same time. Focus on maximizing satisfaction: Think about whether your purchase can bring autonomy, mastery, and purpose, thereby increasing your long-term satisfaction. For example, a daily latte might allow you to do your job better. The only right way to spend money is: the way that works for you. Think about what you want to get out of life, and make spending decisions accordingly. Research from the University of Cambridge shows that the more your spending patterns match your psychological state, the higher your life satisfaction, and this effect is greater than the happiness brought by your total income. Chapter 5. How Much Lifestyle Inflation Is Harmless? # Lifestyle inflation refers to the increase in spending that follows an increase in one\u0026rsquo;s income. Some lifestyle inflation is enjoyable, but too much lifestyle inflation will lead to having to delay retirement. The author simulates the retirement plans of two investors with different savings rates after salary increases to arrive at these conclusions: The lower your current savings rate, the higher your lifestyle inflation can be without affecting your original retirement plan. The author recommends saving at least 50% of your future raises, a rule that is simple, practical, and suitable for most people. Chapter 6. Should You Go Into Debt? # Debt is not necessarily good or bad, it depends on how you use it.\nDebt as a form of risk mitigation: Some people, even with savings, keep credit card debt as a strategy to reduce the risk of future funding shortages. Debt as a behavioral pillar of forced savings: Some people use debt as a behavioral pillar to force themselves to save. The two most useful types of debt: To reduce risk: for example, keeping cash on hand for emergencies or fixing housing costs. To earn a return higher than the cost of borrowing: for example, by taking out education loans, business loans, or mortgages to generate higher returns. The author uses data to demonstrate that getting a college degree is often worthwhile. Debt can also have non-financial costs, such as psychological stress and health problems, so non-mortgage financial debt should be avoided as much as possible. Chapter 7. Should You Rent or Buy? # The point of buying a home is not whether to buy it, but when to buy it.\nIn addition to the mortgage, there are a number of one-time and ongoing costs associated with buying a home, such as down payment, closing costs, taxes, maintenance, and insurance. The author details these costs, concluding that buying a home is only cost-effective if the buyer intends to live in it for the long term. In the short term, buying a home is riskier than renting, but in the long term, renters face greater long-term risks such as rent fluctuations, housing instability, and moving costs. In the United States, the long-term return on homeownership as an investment is not ideal, far lower than the stock market. The author uses the example of his grandparents buying a home to illustrate this point. The right time to buy a home is when you: plan to stay in that location for at least ten years; have a stable personal and professional life; can afford a 20% down payment and keep your debt-to-income ratio below 43%. The author recommends, if possible, to make a 20% down payment and buy a larger home in one step, because the transaction costs are lower in the long run. Chapter 8. How to Save For a Down Payment (and Other Big Purchases)? # Why the length of time you save matters?\nShort-term saving for less than two years: Holding cash is the best option, as it has the lowest risk. Long-term saving for more than two years: Investing in bonds is preferable to holding cash because bond returns can offset the effects of inflation. The author compares cash and bonds using two examples: \u0026ldquo;Save $1,000 per month with a goal of $24,000\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Save $1,000 per month with a goal of $60,000\u0026rdquo;. Longer-term saving for more than three years: You can choose to invest in stocks, but the risk is higher and you need to choose an appropriate portfolio based on your own risk tolerance. The author uses data to show that stocks have much higher long-term returns than bonds, but also greater volatility. Chapter 9. When Can You Retire? # There\u0026rsquo;s more to consider than just money when it comes to retirement.\nThe 4% rule: When your retirement savings reach 25 times your expected annual expenses, you can retire. You can withdraw 4% of your investment assets (half bonds and half stocks) in the first year of retirement, and increase the amount withdrawn by 3% each year to keep up with inflation. If you have a pension or other guaranteed income, you only need to save 25 times your \u0026ldquo;annual excess spending\u0026rdquo; (expected annual expenses less future guaranteed income). The crossover point rule: The point at which your monthly investment income is greater than your monthly expenses, you have reached the \u0026ldquo;crossover point\u0026rdquo; and achieved financial freedom. \u0026ldquo;Crossover Assets\u0026rdquo; = Monthly Expenses / Monthly Investment Return. Retirement is much more than just a financial decision, it\u0026rsquo;s a lifestyle decision. You need to think about what you want to do and how you want to live after retirement. The author uses the examples of several celebrities to illustrate the confusion and emptiness that can exist after early retirement. Chapter 10. Why You Should Invest? # Three reasons to make your money grow.\nSave for your future self: Investing allows you to have a pool of resources to draw from as you age. Human lifespans are increasing, and the concept of \u0026ldquo;retirement\u0026rdquo; has emerged accordingly. To ensure quality of life after retirement, it is necessary to invest in advance. Fight inflation and maintain the purchasing power of your wealth: Investing can offset the impact of inflation and maintain or increase your purchasing power. The author uses data to show that investing can effectively combat the effects of inflation. Replace your human capital with financial capital: Investing can turn your diminishing human capital into financial capital that can continue to generate returns. The author illustrates this with the example of professional athletes. Chapter 11. What Should You Invest In? # There is no single right way to get rich.\nThe author lists a variety of income-producing assets, including: Stocks: One of the most reliable ways to build wealth over the long term, easy to own and trade, with low maintenance costs, but highly volatile and valuations easily influenced by market sentiment. Bonds: Low volatility, safe principal, and helpful in rebalancing portfolios, but returns are generally lower than stocks, especially in a low interest rate environment. Investment real estate: Returns are higher than stocks or bonds, especially when using leverage, but require more effort to manage and are difficult to diversify. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): Provide access to real estate investment income without needing to manage it yourself, but are more volatile and highly correlated with stocks and other risky assets during stock market crashes. Farmland: Low correlation with stocks and bonds, low volatility, inflation-resistant, but low liquidity, higher fees, and requires \u0026ldquo;accredited investor\u0026rdquo; status to participate. Small businesses/franchises/angel investing: Potential for high returns and the more effort you put in, the greater the return, but requires a significant time commitment and has a high failure rate. Royalties: Can generate stable income that is uncorrelated with traditional financial assets, but sellers incur high fees and public taste changes are unpredictable. Your own products: 100% ownership, personal satisfaction and achievement, can create a valuable brand, but very labor-intensive and no guarantee of return. The author also contrasts the characteristics of income-producing and non-income-producing assets (e.g., gold, cryptocurrency, art, etc.) and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Chapter 12. Why You Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t Buy Individual Stocks? # Why underperforming the market is the least of your worries?\nMost people (even professionals) can\u0026rsquo;t beat the market. Data from the SPIVA report shows that active funds tend to underperform index funds over the long term. Only a very small percentage of individual stocks outperform in the long run. Bessembinder\u0026rsquo;s research indicates that since 1926, only 4% of stocks have generated returns that exceed U.S. Treasury bonds. Even stocks that outperform are not always winners. West\u0026rsquo;s statistical analysis suggests that many companies will disappear within a decade. Choosing individual stocks is emotionally draining and stressful. The author uses the example of his friend Darren investing in GameStop stock to detail the emotional rollercoaster of stock trading. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell if you\u0026rsquo;re really good at picking stocks. The link between stock picking decisions and outcomes is not significant, making it difficult to assess your stock picking skills. Even if you have performed well in the past, there is no guarantee that you will continue to do so in the future. The risk of holding a concentrated position in a single stock is that the return is lower than the market. The author uses data on U.S. stock performance since 1963 to show that the median return of individual stocks is lower than that of index funds. The author suggests buying index funds or ETFs to earn market average returns, which can lead to higher returns and less stress during the investment process. Chapter 13. How Early Should You Start Investing? # Why buying early is better than buying late?\nMost markets tend to go up most of the time, so investing early allows for a longer period of compounding growth. The author compares two investment strategies: Buy now: Put all the money you can invest in immediately. Average in: Invest the money you can invest in batches. Conclusion: The buy now strategy is generally better than the average-in strategy. The author uses U.S. stock market data from 1997 to 2020, as well as U.S. stock market data from 1920 to 2020, to respectively prove this conclusion. The same results hold when testing other types of assets. For risk-averse investors, you can choose to invest in a lower risk portfolio. For example, change an 80% stock / 20% bond portfolio to a 60% stock / 40% bond portfolio. Even if market valuations are high, the buy now strategy is still better than the average in strategy. The author compares the two strategies using CAPE percentile categories, and the results show that the buy now strategy is still superior even during periods of high valuations. For investors concerned about the risk of a lump sum investment, you can take a longer time to gradually adjust to your target asset allocation. Chapter 14. Why You Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t Wait to Buy the Dip? # Even God can\u0026rsquo;t beat dollar-cost averaging.\nThe buy the dip strategy only works if the market is about to have a big drop and you can accurately predict when it will happen. Big market drops don\u0026rsquo;t happen that often, so the buy the dip strategy has a small chance of beating dollar-cost averaging. The author simulates the two strategies using U.S. stock market data from between 1920 and 1980. The results show that in all forty-year investment periods, the buy-the-dip strategy underperformed dollar-cost averaging more than 70% of the time. Even with perfect information, the buy the dip strategy often loses to dollar-cost averaging because the market may continue to rise while you miss out on compounding growth. The author simulates the two strategies using U.S. stock market data from 1975 onward, again proving this conclusion. Even if the predicted time of the market bottom is off by only two months, the long-term investment performance of the buy-the-dip strategy still loses to dollar-cost averaging. Conclusion: you should invest as early as possible and as often as possible. Investment returns are heavily influenced by time, and the power of strategy is far less than the power of market change. Chapter 15. Why Does Investing Involve Luck? # And why you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t care.\nThe year you were born influences your investment returns because markets fluctuate unpredictably. The author illustrates this with data on 10-, 20-, and 30-year investment returns in the U.S. stock market since 1910. The sequence of investment returns also affects your final return because you invest more money in the later stages of your investment, so later returns are more important. The author illustrates the impact of return sequence with two cases of 20-year investment horizons with the same annualized return but in reverse order. How to mitigate bad luck: Hold low-risk assets (such as bonds) for the long term to diversify risk. Withdraw less money during market downturns. Consider getting a part-time job to supplement your income. Chapter 16. Why You Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t Fear Market Volatility? # The price of admission for successful investing.\nAvoiding too many market declines can limit your upside. Using the analogy of a \u0026ldquo;market genie\u0026rdquo; that tells you the maximum intra-year drawdown for the coming year, the author simulates different risk aversion strategies. The conclusion is that if you want to maximize long-term wealth, you should accept some degree of intra-year market decline (0% to 15%) and avoid large intra-year market declines (greater than 15%). Buying a diversified portfolio of income-producing assets over the long term is one of the best ways to combat market volatility as it rears its ugly head. Chapter 17. How to Buy During a Crisis? # Why you should keep your cool when the market panics?\nMarket crashes are opportunities to buy because every dollar you invest at this point will earn a higher return after the market recovers. The author uses the 1929 U.S. stock market crash as an example to illustrate the excess returns of investing at the bottom of the market. The more the market falls, the higher the return you need to make up for the loss. The author illustrates this with a simple mathematical formula and chart. Even if the market takes a long time to recover, buying during a crisis is still a good decision because you can earn a decent annualized return while you wait. The author proves this conclusion using examples of the U.S. stock market falling 30% and 50% between 1920 and 2020. Most stock markets trend upwards most of the time, and even if a prolonged downturn occurs, the likelihood of losing money is significantly reduced if you make regular investments as most investors do, rather than a single lump sum investment. The author illustrates this with the example of the Japanese stock market. Chapter 18. When Should You Sell? # About rebalancing, concentrated positions, and the purpose of investing.\nThree situations where you should consider selling an investment asset: Rebalancing your portfolio. Getting rid of a concentrated (or consistently losing) investment position. Meeting your financial needs. You should have a plan in place before you consider selling investment assets to avoid emotional decisions. Selling gradually (or selling later) is generally better than selling immediately, because in the long run, the market tends to go up. Regularly rebalancing your portfolio can reduce risk, but it generally reduces returns. The author simulates two strategies, annual rebalancing and never rebalancing, using a portfolio of 60% stocks/40% bonds, and compares the returns and maximum drawdowns after 30 years. Accumulative rebalancing is a better way to rebalance by buying asset classes that are underweight over time to avoid incurring tax liabilities. The author uses the same portfolio to simulate a strategy of adding investments each month, demonstrating that this strategy can effectively reduce the maximum drawdown. For investors holding large concentrated positions, it is advisable to sell some of the assets to reduce risk and meet their own living needs. Selling strategies can range from selling a portion on a regular basis to selling based on price levels, as long as it is decided in advance. Chapter 19. Where Should Your Investments Be Held? # On taxes, traditional 401(k) vs. Roth 401(k), and why you might not want to maximize your 401(k).\nTax policy in the United States is constantly changing, and financial management should also be adjusted according to tax policy. The author reviews the history of income tax in the United States to illustrate this point. When choosing between a traditional 401(k) and a Roth 401(k), the most important factor is whether your effective income tax rate is higher now (during your working years) or later (in retirement). The author favors traditional 401(k)s because they offer more flexibility and allow you to convert funds to a Roth IRA when tax rates are lower, such as when you are in business school or on maternity leave. Roth 401(k)s may be a better option for high savers because they can enjoy greater total tax deferral benefits. The author illustrates this with the example of Sally and Sam. Using a retirement savings account to invest can avoid capital gains taxes, which can lead to significant long-term gains. The author uses simulated data to compare the returns of three approaches: tax-free accounts, accounts taxed once on capital gains, and accounts taxed annually on capital gains. The author also explains the impact of compounding on investment returns. Maximizing your 401(k) may not be the best option because 401(k) plan fees may offset the tax benefits. The author suggests that you should at least increase your personal contributions to the point where you can receive the maximum employer match. For any contributions beyond that, you need to take into account the 401(k)\u0026rsquo;s expense ratio and your own need for liquidity. When allocating assets, it is advisable to place high-growth assets (e.g. stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and low-growth assets (e.g. bonds) in taxable accounts. Chapter 20. Why Will You Never Feel Rich? # You might already be rich, so why not?\nPeople can always find someone richer than themselves, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to feel content. The author illustrates people\u0026rsquo;s sense of relative wealth by telling the story of Powerball lottery winner Jack Whittaker, and the story of his friend John. If you compare yourself to people around the world, you may find that you are much richer than you think. For example, if your net worth is over $4,210, you are wealthier than half the world; if your net worth is over $93,170, you are in the top 10% of the world\u0026rsquo;s wealth. Don\u0026rsquo;t let feelings of relative wealth affect your happiness and appreciate the wealth you have. Chapter 21. The Most Important Asset # Why you can never get more of this asset.\nTime is your most important asset, and how you use your time will have a huge impact on your future life. The author tells the story of Dashrath Manjhi, an Indian villager who carved a road through a mountain, to illustrate the power of time. In your younger years, you should prioritize career development because that\u0026rsquo;s when your income grows the fastest. The author uses his own experience to illustrate the importance of making the right career choices early on. Don\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice your time in pursuit of money, because you can never buy more time with money. People\u0026rsquo;s happiness tends to follow a U-shaped curve as they age, overestimating their future happiness in their youth, being more pessimistic in middle age, and feeling pleasantly surprised in old age. Conclusion. The Just Keep Buying Rules # How to win the time traveler\u0026rsquo;s game?\nThe author summarizes 21 financial guidelines to help you succeed on your financial journey, these guidelines are called the \u0026ldquo;Just Keep Buying Rules\u0026rdquo;: The poor should focus on saving, and the rich should focus on investing. Save what you can save. Focus on income, not expenses. Use the \u0026ldquo;2x rule\u0026rdquo; to eliminate spending guilt. Save at least 50% of your future raises and bonuses. Debt is not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing, it depends on how you use it. Only buy a house when the timing is right. Use cash when saving for large purchases. There\u0026rsquo;s more to retirement than just money. Invest to accumulate financial capital to replace your diminishing human capital. Think like an owner and buy income-producing assets. Don\u0026rsquo;t buy individual stocks. Buy fast, sell slow. Invest as early and as often as possible. Investing is not just about the cards you have, it\u0026rsquo;s also about how you play them. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid when volatility inevitably comes. Market crashes are usually opportunities to buy. Use your money for the life you need before risking it for the life you want. Think twice before maximizing your 401(k). You\u0026rsquo;ll never feel rich, and that\u0026rsquo;s okay. Time is your most important asset. III. Quotes # The surest way to get rich is to increase your income and invest in income-producing assets.\nAnalysis: Instead of blindly pursuing saving, it is better to focus your energy on increasing your income and investing in assets that can generate income; this is a more reliable path to financial freedom.\nThe only right way to spend money is the way that works for you.\nAnalysis: Everyone\u0026rsquo;s values, life goals, and preferences are different, so their financial management style should also be personalized. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly follow the crowd; find a spending pattern that suits you in order to achieve true happiness.\nTime is your most important asset.\nAnalysis: Time is a non-renewable resource. We should cherish time and spend it on the most valuable things. Investing early is not only about accumulating wealth, but also about buying back more time and freedom.\nIV. Guiding Significance # Establishing the right financial mindset: This book helps us understand the essence of personal finance and how to develop a sound savings and investment plan, avoiding common financial pitfalls. Enhancing personal competitiveness: The book emphasizes the importance of increasing income and encourages us to continuously learn and improve our personal skills to gain greater career development space. Balancing life and wealth: The author reminds us that wealth is not the only goal in life. We should focus on the quality of life and the realization of personal values while pursuing wealth. Viewing investment rationally: This book emphasizes the importance of long-term investing and warns investors not to blindly chase short-term gains or be intimidated by market volatility.

Main Topic # The most important thing in investing is maximizing the probability of success, not maximizing returns. Investors should control risks, avoid being forced to interrupt compounding due to market fluctuations, and choose investment portfolios that can be held for the long term. James emphasizes the importance of asset allocation, especially the role of cash, and the need to choose appropriate investment strategies based on different individuals (retired/not retired, different asset sizes).\nII. Briefing Content # The Most Important Thing in Investing: The goal of investing is to maximize the probability of success, not to maximize the rate of return. Risk management is to maximize the success of the investment portfolio and avoid interrupting compound growth due to being forced to sell because of market fluctuations. Good investment assets must be able to withstand fear and panic. The best investment strategies are those that do not create fear and panic. Sufficient cash is the best asset to help you sleep well and survive a sharp market decline. Risks of Stock Pledging: Stock pledging can easily lead to bankruptcy if asset allocation is not done properly. Do not try stock pledging lightly if you do not understand the operating principles of stock pledging, otherwise, you will most likely go bankrupt. Most people do not need to do stock pledging. Good asset allocation can make you rich without pledging. Asset Allocation for Different Individuals: Individuals who are not retired and have salary income: Refer to the article \u0026ldquo;Asset Allocation for Those Who Are Still Some Time Away from Retirement\u0026rdquo;, with QQQ as the main investment. Individuals who are retired and have no income: Refer to the article \u0026ldquo;Asset Allocation for Those Who Are Retired and Have No Income\u0026rdquo;, and choose QQQ, SPY, or high-dividend ETFs for allocation based on asset size, and consider the withdrawal rate. Investment and Life Philosophy: Investing is like life. It requires continuous learning and experiencing different stages to find an investment strategy that suits you. Resist temptation, avoid chasing short-term hotspots, and adhere to long-term investment. A-share Market Volatility: The A-share market has recently experienced a surge and a plunge, with many investors being trapped due to chasing hotspots. Market fluctuations are normal, especially in emerging markets. Investors need to be rational and adhere to long-term investment strategies. The Chinese government\u0026rsquo;s cooling measures are aimed at preventing further expansion of the bubble and protecting the interests of investors. Beware of Pump and Dump Schemes: Some online groups and \u0026ldquo;teachers\u0026rdquo; use market forecasts and insider information to induce investors to make trades and profit from them. Be wary of these pump and dump schemes. The futures market, due to its smaller scale, is more susceptible to manipulation. Be wary of pump and dump schemes in the futures market as well. CLEC Investment and Financial Management Channel Update Plan: Due to the time-consuming nature of producing short videos and the low viewership, we plan to stop updating short videos. The content of the produced short videos will be condensed into a briefing format and shared with you on Saturdays for discussion. It is recommended that you listen to long videos several times or listen to them in segments to achieve the same learning effect. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Ethan:\nSharing: In China, a similar effect to stock pledging can be achieved through the margin financing function of securities firms. Sharing: The A-share market has recently experienced drastic fluctuations, and many investors have been influenced by the media to chase hotspots, resulting in heavy losses. Viewpoint: If you don\u0026rsquo;t have the right understanding of the stock market, you are the victim. Jackie:\nSharing: Her personal journey of investing in the Nasdaq, from skepticism to firm holding, and finally overcoming psychological barriers to achieve \u0026ldquo;buy whenever you have money\u0026rdquo;. H:\nSharing: Followed recommendations for meme stocks in 2021, resulting in heavy losses. Started gradually transferring funds to QQQ in 2023 and using leverage. Question: The current proportions of QQQ, QLD, and SGOV have deviated from the initial 70%, 20%, and 10%. Is rebalancing needed? How should it be rebalanced? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: It is recommended to adopt a smart rebalancing strategy. Transfer 30% of the QLD profits to SGOV. When the market falls, transfer 2% of the total assets in cash to QLD. Im:\nSharing: Uses the mural story of Journey to the West as an analogy for the different stages of investment, reminding investors not to chase short-term gains and to adhere to long-term investment and continuous learning. Question: How to persuade people who spend extravagantly to develop the habit of saving? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: You can introduce them to the concept of long-term investment in index funds and the power of compound growth. Provide help within your means. Question: If you also have the habit of spending extravagantly, how do you control it? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Live within your means. As your wealth grows, it is normal for your living standards to gradually improve within the scope of risk control, but avoid excessive consumption and spending beyond your means. Sunny:\nSharing: The CLEC course not only teaches investment knowledge but also conveys life philosophy, helping everyone maintain a stable mindset in life and work. Viewpoint: People with stable emotions are the most valuable. Investing in QQQ also brings peace of mind. Beisen:\nBackground: Assets of 70 million, monthly mortgage payment of 125,000. Question: How to allocate assets to achieve early retirement? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Based on the current assets and expenses, immediate retirement is not possible. It is recommended to try the SPY asset allocation strategy, or use part of the funds to invest in high-dividend ETFs, and control the withdrawal rate. Kevin:\nQuestion: Why has Tesla fallen so much? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Investing in individual stocks requires understanding the company better than the CEO to grasp the ups and downs of the stock price. If you don\u0026rsquo;t understand Tesla\u0026rsquo;s business model, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t invest in it. Question: If you are very confident in Tesla, can you hold it for the long term? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: If you truly understand and are optimistic about Tesla, you can hold it for the long term, but you must manage risks well. Question: Does the teacher think the stock market will fall to zero? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: \u0026ldquo;Falling to zero\u0026rdquo; is a figure of speech, which means that even if the stock does not completely fall to zero, it will not be able to be realized if it falls to a certain level, and cash is needed to maintain life. Ming:\nSharing: I have invested in individual stocks before, and they all ended up going to zero in the end, so now I want to learn how to invest in index ETFs. Background: Total assets of 3.3 million, of which 2 million are in a brokerage account, 300,000 are in a Roth account, and 1 million are in a traditional IRA account. About to retire. Question: How to allocate cash and index ETFs? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: It is recommended to fully invest the brokerage account in SPY, the Roth account in TQQQ, and 60% of the traditional IRA account in money market funds and 40% in SPY. Question: How to withdraw funds after retirement? Do you sell even in a loss state? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: After retirement, you can withdraw 3% of your total assets for living expenses. You can sell SPY or obtain funds through stock pledging loans. You have to sell even in a loss state because you need cash to maintain your life. Question: Is the risk of investing in TQQQ in a Roth account too high? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: It is to maintain a certain cash ratio while obtaining relatively high returns. In extreme cases, you can transfer cash from the traditional IRA to the brokerage account or sell TQQQ to supplement cash. Question: How to transfer funds from a traditional IRA to a Roth account? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Transfer out a portion of the money every year and use loans or salary to pay taxes. Question: Why is the borrowing interest rate 5% and the cash interest rate only 2.5% when calculating interest in SPACE? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: This is just a conservative estimate. The yield of money market funds is usually lower than the borrowing interest rate. Sara:\nSharing: I have been investing in QQQ for three years and recently also invested in meme stocks. Question: I plan to borrow money to invest. Should I buy QLD? How should cash be allocated? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Based on Sara\u0026rsquo;s questions, it can be seen that she does not understand the concepts of stock pledging, leveraged ETFs, and asset allocation. Borrowing money to invest is not recommended. It is recommended to continue holding the 80% QQQ + 20% cash portfolio, and cash can be invested in BOXS. Tom:\nQuestion: How to maintain the cash ratio and avoid excessive tax rates in the case of long-term borrowing to live? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Leveraged ETFs and cash should be placed in retirement accounts as much as possible. Borrowing from a brokerage account should not exceed 70% of the account assets. Invest Roth IRA in TQQQ and hold cash in a traditional IRA. In extreme cases, the cash in the traditional IRA can be transferred to the brokerage account or TQQQ can be sold to supplement cash. The borrowing amount should be controlled within a certain range, for example, not exceeding 2% of the total assets per year. Taxes incurred by transferring a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA can be paid with loans or salary. Question: Why is the borrowing interest rate 5% while the cash interest rate is only calculated as 2.5% in SPACE? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: This is just a conservative estimate. Money market fund yields are usually lower than borrowing rates. Question: How to handle it if funds in the Brokerage account need to be used before retirement? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: You can use the funds in the Brokerage account for a pledge loan, but you need sufficient cash as a guarantee. Question: What if the cash in the Brokerage account is insufficient to cover the loan in the event of an extreme stock market decline? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: In extreme cases, you can transfer the cash in the Roth or Traditional IRA account to the Brokerage account, but this is an emergency measure and will incur penalties. Question: Is investing TQQQ in a Roth IRA too risky? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Investing Roth IRA in TQQQ is to obtain higher returns while ensuring a certain cash ratio. If you are concerned about risks, you can appropriately reduce the proportion of TQQQ and increase the proportion of money market funds. Question: In the long run, will borrowing from a Brokerage account lead to paying high taxes? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Borrowing itself does not increase the tax burden, but it can avoid the tax burden caused by selling stocks. However, if you transfer funds from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, it will increase your taxable income for the year and you will need to pay additional taxes. IV.

Summary # \u0026ldquo;Property of Money\u0026rdquo; is Korean entrepreneur Kim Seung-ho\u0026rsquo;s insightful account of his path to financial success. Starting from humble beginnings, he climbed the economic ladder, gaining profound insights into the multifaceted nature of money. Driven by a desire to share his valuable experiences, the book explores five key attributes of money and outlines four essential skills necessary for achieving wealth. Through compelling stories and real-life examples, Kim Seung-ho demystifies complex economic concepts and investment principles, offering readers a practical guide towards financial freedom.\nII. Chapter Summary # Part 1: The Essence of Money # Money is Personified: Kim personifies money, suggesting it possesses emotions and will. Your attitude towards money influences how it behaves towards you. Respect and treat it like a friend to earn its favor.\nInvesting in Superior Entrepreneurs: Investing in companies and entrepreneurs more competent than oneself is a wise move, akin to partnering with them and reaping the rewards of their success. The author shares how he invested in successful companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Nike, effectively becoming their \u0026ldquo;partner.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Secret of Compound Interest: Compound interest is a fundamental principle in investment, capable of multiplying wealth. However, one must also be wary of its power when applied to debt. The author uses Warren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Mona Lisa\u0026rdquo; analogy to illustrate the impact of compound interest.\nThe Strength of Fixed Income: Stable cash flow surpasses inconsistent income, attracting and accumulating wealth. Kim compares fixed income to a well-trained army, capable of efficiently managing a large-scale organization despite smaller numbers.\nMoney\u0026rsquo;s Gravitational Force: Substantial wealth attracts more wealth. Starting with small accumulations, compound interest propels wealth multiplication, much like the Earth formed from the gradual attraction of minuscule particles. The author illustrates this concept with the Han River and the Amazon River, demonstrating how small streams can converge to form vast rivers.\nHighest Risk, Lowest Risk: The stock market is riskiest when everyone is bullish and chasing the latest hot stock; conversely, it\u0026rsquo;s least risky when fear grips the market and everyone is selling. Maintain a balanced perspective on fear and greed, embracing opportunity during widespread fear and exercising caution when greed prevails. Warren Buffet\u0026rsquo;s famous quote, \u0026ldquo;Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,\u0026rdquo; encapsulates this wisdom. The author uses the example of increased airline safety a week after an accident to illustrate this point.\nTreat Others\u0026rsquo; Money as You Treat Your Own: Treating others\u0026rsquo; money with respect safeguards your own from similar disrespect. Respect for others\u0026rsquo; money is reciprocated. The author uses his attitude towards shopping carts at supermarkets to emphasize the importance of respecting others\u0026rsquo; money.\nInheriting Millions with a \u0026ldquo;No Loss\u0026rdquo; Clause: Through a hypothetical scenario, Kim highlights that preserving wealth is not straightforward. It requires learning, accumulating experience, and recognizing the significance of consistent income. The protagonist in the story inherits a substantial sum with the stipulation of no loss, ultimately realizing that maintaining wealth\u0026rsquo;s value is no easy feat.\nRejecting Quick Riches: The pursuit of quick wealth often leads to speculative traps and the perils of greed, ultimately ending in failure. Building wealth demands a steady and gradual approach. The author uses the analogy of constructing a house to demonstrate the importance of gradual wealth accumulation.\nCan Economists Predict the Future?: No one can accurately predict the macroeconomic future, especially in the long term, due to inherent uncertainties. Resist blindly following expert predictions; cultivate independent thinking and continuous learning.

He reached a more accurate assessment by comparing the total number of infections with the infection rate.\nEach Dollar Experiences Time Differently: Borrowing Einstein\u0026rsquo;s theory of relativity, the author suggests that money is also subject to the influence of time. Different sources of money experience time differently; always invest with money that has ample time. Kim compares \u0026ldquo;time-rich\u0026rdquo; money to individuals who have more time to build relationships, fall in love, and raise children.\nDiversification Isn\u0026rsquo;t Enough: Kim critiques the misinterpretation of the saying \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t put all your eggs in one basket.\u0026rdquo; Diversifying within a single market is merely using multiple baskets on the same shelf, still exposed to risk. He recommends spreading investments across diverse markets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate.\nThree Paths to Wealth: The author outlines three ways to become wealthy: inheritance, winning the lottery, and business success.

Avoid lending money to siblings for business ventures or assisting parents in upgrading their homes or cars. Under 500 Million Won: You can purchase a house or car for your parents, cover all their living expenses, and assist nieces and nephews with education costs.

Summary # The central argument of the book is that financial success is less about IQ and more about how you behave. Author Morgan Housel argues that by understanding the common psychological pitfalls associated with money, we can make better decisions. He illustrates this through a series of compelling stories and case studies, shedding light on our financial decision-making process.\nII. Chapter Summaries # 1. No One\u0026rsquo;s Crazy\nPeople’s unique experiences shape their financial perspectives and actions, leading to seemingly irrational yet logically justifiable behaviors. For example, low-income individuals might be drawn to lotteries as their perceived only shot at a life-altering fortune. 2. Luck \u0026amp; Risk\nNothing is as good or as bad as it seems, as luck and risk play crucial roles in personal outcomes. Bill Gates getting into a high school with a computer was luck. His friend Kent Evans dying in a mountain climbing accident was risk. Recognizing the influence of luck and risk helps avoid over-attributing success or failure solely to personal effort or poor decisions. 3. Never Enough\nContentment is key in finance. The pursuit of \u0026ldquo;never enough\u0026rdquo; leads to a dangerous cycle of insatiable desire that can ultimately lead to ruin. Former McKinsey CEO Rajat Gupta and Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff are cited as examples of individuals who lost everything due to greed. 4. Confounding Compounding\nCompounding’s power lies in long-term accumulation, allowing even small gains to snowball into extraordinary results. Warren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s immense wealth is attributed not just to skilled investment but to 70 years of consistent investing, highlighting the power of time. 5. Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy\nGetting wealthy requires taking risks, while staying wealthy requires humility, frugality, and respecting the fleeting nature of good fortune. Trading legend Jesse Livermore, despite remarkable success, fell victim to overconfidence and excessive risk-taking, ultimately leading to bankruptcy and suicide. 6. Tails, You Win\nIn business and investing, \u0026ldquo;tail events\u0026rdquo; (rare, high-impact events) often disproportionately drive overall results. Walt Disney produced hundreds of films, but the success of a single one, Snow White, propelled his entire enterprise to unimaginable heights. 7. Freedom\nThe greatest dividend of wealth is the ability to control your time, offering the ultimate flexibility to pursue your passions and spend time with loved ones. 8. The Ferrari Fallacy\nPeople care less about your wealth than you think. Their attention is often directed towards their own desires and comparing themselves to you. 9. Wealth is What You Don\u0026rsquo;t See\nTrue wealth lies not in flashy possessions but in the unseen: financial security, flexibility, and the ability to make choices. 10. Save Money\nBuilding wealth hinges on your savings rate, which is driven by lifestyle choices and managing desires. 11. Reasonable \u0026gt; Rational\nIn financial decisions, making reasonable choices that you can stick with is often more effective than striving for absolute rationality. 12. Surprise!\nHistory is full of surprises, so relying solely on historical patterns to predict the future is unreliable. Recognizing the constant possibility of the unexpected is crucial. 13. Room for Error\nThe most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan: Building in a margin of safety is crucial. 14. You\u0026rsquo;ll Change\nOur goals, thoughts, and aspirations change over time. Acknowledging this is essential when making long-term financial plans. Avoid extreme financial goals, embracing the fluid nature of life. 15. Nothing\u0026rsquo;s Free\nEverything has a price. Success in investing comes with costs: volatility, fear, and uncertainty. Viewing these as fees for a valuable service rather than penalties to avoid helps navigate the emotional rollercoaster of investing. 16. No One\u0026rsquo;s Crazy (Reprise)\nAvoid blindly following financial advice from people with different circumstances and timelines than your own. 17. The Seduction of Pessimism\nPessimism often seems more intelligent and gains more attention, even though the world has generally improved significantly over time. 18. When You Believe Anything\nThe power of narratives shapes our beliefs. The more we want something to be true, the more likely we are to embrace narratives that inflate its likelihood, especially in high-risk, high-reward scenarios like investing. 19. Summary\nThis chapter provides a recap of the key principles and advice from previous chapters to guide sound financial decision-making. 20. Confessions\nThe author shares his own personal approach to money management, highlighting the importance of seeking financial independence and emphasizing long-term investing. Appendix: A Brief History of the American Consumer\nPost-WWII, the US deliberately engineered the American consumer through low-interest rates, consumer credit, and programs like the GI Bill, fostering a culture of consumption and economic growth. From the 1950s to the 1970s, income distribution remained relatively equitable, the debt was manageable, and confidence in a better future was high. The 1980s onwards witnessed growing income inequality. The aspirational lifestyles of a small group of prosperous individuals diverged drastically from those of the average person, fostering a culture of keeping up appearances, fueled by debt. The 2008 financial crisis, a culmination of a debt bubble, exposed the cracks in this system. Recent years have seen a rise in social unrest tied to income inequality, prompting individuals to question the current economic and social model. III. Memorable Quotes # \u0026ldquo;Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.\u0026rdquo;\nLife’s outcomes are influenced by chance and factors outside our control. This quote urges us to be mindful of the unpredictable nature of events. \u0026ldquo;The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.\u0026rdquo;\nContentment is essential for financial well-being. Constantly shifting financial goals in pursuit of \u0026ldquo;more\u0026rdquo; can become a destructive cycle. \u0026ldquo;The greatest dividend of wealth is the ability to control your time.\u0026rdquo;\nWealth allows us to free ourselves from time constraints, enabling us to spend our time as we see fit. \u0026ldquo;Wealth is what you don\u0026rsquo;t see.\u0026rdquo;\nTrue wealth resides in our ability to make choices and have options, not in material possessions. “Save Money. Just save.”\nSaving should be a default behavior, a fundamental habit for financial stability and future flexibility. “No One’s Crazy (Reprise).”\nRecognize that financial advice must be individualized. Avoid mimicking strategies without considering personal circumstances and goals. IV. Practical Takeaways # Acknowledge your psychological biases – Understand your weaknesses related to managing money and avoid impulsive decisions. View money as a tool, not an end goal – Strive to use wealth as a means to achieve freedom and happiness, not to pursue material possessions. Create a financial plan that makes sense to you – Develop a plan, tailored to your needs and risk tolerance, that fosters financial stability. Incorporate a margin of safety for unforeseen events and market fluctuations. Invest for the long-term and stay the course – Compounding works best over long periods. Choose an investment strategy that resonates with your goals and commit to it, riding out the inevitable market ups and downs. Pursue time freedom and happiness – Remember that the ultimate goal of acquiring wealth is to create a life of greater freedom and happiness.

Summary # This book reveals a financial secret that everyone can learn but is rarely taught in school: You don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a finance expert or a high-income earner to achieve financial freedom; prudent spending and rational investing are all it takes, even on a modest income.\nThe author, Andrew Hallam, is a high school English teacher who started investing at age 19 and became a millionaire by age 38. He distilled his years of investment experience and wisdom he garnered from numerous financial wizards into nine simple and actionable principles. Supported by factual cases and personal anecdotes, he guides readers step-by-step towards financial freedom.\nII. Chapter Summaries # Lesson One: Spend Like You Want to Grow Rich # Distinguish between \u0026ldquo;wants\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;needs\u0026rdquo;: Spend rationally, control unnecessary expenses, and avoid over-reliance on credit cards. Invest the money you save. Example: In his youth, the author lived an extremely frugal life to pay off his student loans as quickly as possible, succeeding within a year and subsequently investing all his income. How to buy a car for less: Opt for low-mileage, easy-to-resell used cars instead of blindly pursuing luxury vehicles. Example: The author purchased low-mileage used Japanese cars in his youth and sold them for the same or even higher price after a few years, turning a small profit. Buying a house: It\u0026rsquo;s not about the down payment, but the interest rate: Consider whether you can still afford the mortgage if the interest rate doubles to prevent financial strain due to rising rates. Start strong, don\u0026rsquo;t rely on a \u0026ldquo;rich dad\u0026rdquo;: Excessive financial support from parents can hinder a child\u0026rsquo;s ability to create wealth independently. Teach them financial knowledge and skills, letting them learn how to earn, save, and invest on their own. Example: Studies show that accountants who received financial assistance from their parents had 43% less average wealth than their self-made counterparts. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to live like a pauper, but spend like a millionaire: Frugality does not equate to a lower quality of life. It\u0026rsquo;s about investing the money you save, allowing it to work for you instead of the other way around. Lesson Two: Use the Greatest Investment Ally You Have # Leverage compound interest to accelerate wealth accumulation: The earlier you start investing, the longer the time horizon for compound interest to work its magic, leading to faster wealth growth. Example: Investing $45 per month for 40 years yields significantly higher returns than investing $800 per month for only 25 years. Buffett\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark Principle\u0026rdquo;: Invest early, just like Noah built the ark, don\u0026rsquo;t wait for the \u0026ldquo;flood\u0026rdquo; to arrive before taking action. What to do when you get paid: Keep track of your monthly expenses, calculate the amount available for investment, and transfer that money to your investment account on payday to avoid running out of funds at the end of the month. Example: A couple the author knew, both teachers, realized their wasteful spending habits after tracking their expenses for three months. They subsequently allocated more money to investment, tripling their investment amount within two years. The stock market doesn\u0026rsquo;t believe in tears, but it believes in time: In the long run, the stock market rises with corporate earnings growth. Therefore, be patient and don\u0026rsquo;t be intimidated by short-term market fluctuations. The author\u0026rsquo;s stock market investments from 1990 had increased tenfold by 2016. Example: Using Willy Wonka\u0026rsquo;s chocolate factory as an analogy, the author explains the fundamentals of stocks, share prices, dividends, and the stock market in a simple and engaging way, highlighting the substantial returns from long-term investment. Lesson Three: Small Fees Pack Big Punches # Index funds: the secret to effortless wealth generation: Index funds track a specific market index, holding all or most of the stocks in that index to achieve the same return as the market. Their advantages lie in low costs, risk diversification, and stable returns. \u0026ldquo;The Oracle of Omaha\u0026rdquo; buys index funds: Investment gurus like Warren Buffett, Paul Samuelson, and Daniel Kahneman all recommend index funds because they provide market-average returns at the lowest cost, outperforming the vast majority of actively managed funds over the long term. Example: Buffett suggests putting 90% of one\u0026rsquo;s funds into an ultra-low-cost S\u0026amp;P 500 index fund. 78% of active fund returns go to the advisors\u0026rsquo; pockets: The high fees (management fees, transaction costs, commissions, etc.) of actively managed funds will eat up most of the investors\u0026rsquo; gains. Generally, their returns underperform index funds over the long run. Example: The author\u0026rsquo;s wife could have earned an extra $20,000 if she had invested in index funds instead of actively managed funds, as recommended by her financial advisor, over the past five years. Don\u0026rsquo;t bother picking \u0026ldquo;top actively managed funds\u0026rdquo;: There is no reliable method to consistently pick actively managed funds that will outperform index funds. Even if a fund has a history of exceptional performance, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee future success. Their returns tend to revert to the average or lower in the long run. Example: Investors in Morningstar\u0026rsquo;s five-star-rated funds often experience lower long-term returns compared to index fund investors. \u0026ldquo;International citizens\u0026rdquo; should opt for index funds: Actively managed funds are significantly more expensive outside of the US. Therefore, \u0026ldquo;international citizens\u0026rdquo; should choose index funds to lower their investment costs. Lesson Four: Conquer the Enemy in the Mirror # Stay rational, earn 10% returns even in a bear market: Don\u0026rsquo;t let fear and greed dictate your investment decisions. Don\u0026rsquo;t panic sell in a falling market or chase rising prices in a bull market. Stick to regular investment and buy more cheap stocks in a bear market to achieve higher returns in the long run. Example: During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, investors who steadily invested in index funds at the lows ultimately reaped higher returns. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to time the market: No one can accurately predict short-term market trends; don\u0026rsquo;t try to beat the market by timing it. Market timing often causes you to miss the best investment opportunities, leading to lower investment returns. Earning 150%? Be wary of tech stocks: Don\u0026rsquo;t be fooled by high-growth, high-valuation stocks. Stock prices eventually revert to the level justified by corporate earnings. Blindly chasing hot stocks can easily lead to losing your entire investment. Example: The dot-com bubble burst in 1999, causing countless investors to suffer heavy losses. The author himself lost nearly half of his money due to investing in Nortel Networks stock. Falling stocks: a buying opportunity: A bear market is the best time to invest. Seize the opportunity to buy more cheap stocks when prices are low. In the long run, stocks rise with corporate earnings growth. Young people should be excited when stocks rebound: Young investors have more time to allow compound interest to work its magic. They should actually hope for market declines to buy more low-priced stocks. Over the long term, stocks bought at a discount offer higher returns. Lesson Five: Build Mountains of Money with a Responsible Portfolio # Buy bonds as insurance for your stocks: Bonds offer lower returns than stocks but have lower volatility, reducing the overall risk of your portfolio. They act as a buffer when the stock market falls. Short-term bonds: a safe haven for your money: Short-term bonds are less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and are more suitable as a \u0026ldquo;safety cushion\u0026rdquo; for your portfolio. Adjusting your portfolio to profit from market crashes: Determine the appropriate mix of stocks and bonds based on your age and risk tolerance. Rebalance your portfolio regularly (e.g., review it annually), selling bonds to buy stocks in a down market and selling stocks to buy bonds in a bull market. Example: Before the 2008 financial crisis, the author created a portfolio with a 35% bond allocation. During the downturn, he consistently increased his stock holdings. Consequently, he achieved higher returns when the market rebounded. \u0026ldquo;Globalize\u0026rdquo; your investment: Don\u0026rsquo;t limit yourself to the domestic market. Diversify your investments across the globe to further reduce risk and access a wider range of opportunities. \u0026ldquo;Lazy portfolio\u0026rdquo;: adjust once a year for annual returns: Allocate your portfolio equally between stocks and bonds, rebalance once a year. This simple strategy delivers impressive long-term returns without demanding excessive time or effort. Example: Following the \u0026ldquo;Lazy Portfolio\u0026rdquo; strategy allowed investors to achieve positive returns even during the 2008 financial crisis. Lesson Six: Sample a \u0026ldquo;Round-the-World\u0026rdquo; Ticket to Indexing # ETFs: Access Global Markets with One Account: Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a convenient way to invest in index funds. They are traded on stock exchanges like individual stocks and cover a wide array of global markets. How to buy ETFs?: The author details the steps involved in buying ETFs: opening a brokerage account, finding the ETF ticker symbol, determining the price per share, and setting the investment amount, etc. Limit orders vs. market orders: The author explains these two common ETF order types and recommends using limit orders to avoid losses due to price fluctuations. US Indexes: Strategic Allocation for Optimal Returns: For US investors, a portfolio split equally between a US stock market index, a global stock market index, and a US bond market index, with annual rebalancing, is recommended for stable long-term returns. Example: The author\u0026rsquo;s friend, Chris, following this approach, grew his portfolio by 73.09% in 10 years despite experiencing the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Canadian Indexes: Minimize Costs for Maximum Returns: Canadians can build a low-cost, diversified global portfolio using TD Bank\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;e-Series\u0026rdquo; index funds or ETFs. The author uses personal anecdotes to illustrate that Canadian financial advisors are more inclined to recommend actively managed funds while overlooking low-cost index funds. He uses the example of Air Force Technician, Felix, to demonstrate how investors can build a low-cost, diversified portfolio through TD\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;e-Series\u0026rdquo; index funds. UK Indexes: Avoid High Fees, Optimize your Portfolio: UK investors should be wary of high-fee index funds. Building a diversified portfolio using low-cost index funds or ETFs provided by Vanguard or iShares is recommended. The author cites Virgin Money as an example to demonstrate how high fees and tracking errors can significantly affect index fund returns. He then uses the case of software engineer, Paul, to illustrate how investors can utilize iShares and Vanguard ETFs to build a low-cost, diversified portfolio. Australian Indexes: Multi-Asset Portfolios, Lower Fees with Higher Investments: Australians can opt for Vanguard\u0026rsquo;s multi-asset LifeStrategy funds or utilize platforms like Stockspot and Ignition Wealth to build ETF portfolios. The author shares the story of Andy, a software developer, who uses the Nabtrade brokerage platform to buy ETFs and create a diversified index fund portfolio. Singapore indexes: Low cost, smart allocation: Singaporean investors should also be cautious of high-fee index funds. Building a diversified portfolio using low-cost ETFs offered by Vanguard is recommended, but it\u0026rsquo;s important to avoid ETFs traded on US exchanges to avert US estate taxes. The author utilizes the example of \u0026ldquo;Fundsupermart\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;S\u0026amp;P 500 index\u0026rdquo; fund to illustrate how high fees significantly impact long-term investment returns. He further uses the case of a professor couple to show how investors can construct a diversified portfolio using ETFs traded on Singaporean and Canadian exchanges, thus avoiding US estate taxes. Lesson Seven: No, You Don\u0026rsquo;t Have to Invest on Your Own # Why do index investors lag behind the index?: Many investors fall prey to their emotions, making irrational decisions during market fluctuations, or are swayed by investment predictions, ultimately hindering their returns. Example: Some investors panic sell during market downturns and chase rising prices in a bull market, resulting in returns far lower than the index itself. US Robo-Advisors: Let the Smart Investors \u0026ldquo;Win\u0026rdquo; Effortlessly: Robo-advisor platforms can help investors create and manage low-cost index fund portfolios, rebalancing them regularly, and preventing investors from damaging their accounts. Example: Vanguard\u0026rsquo;s Target Retirement Funds offer a one-stop solution at a very low cost, suitable for those who prefer a hands-off approach to investment. The author uses his wife as an example to highlight the advantages of Vanguard Target Retirement Funds: achieving positive returns even without investment knowledge. Vanguard\u0026rsquo;s Comprehensive Financial Advisory Services: Vanguard provides comprehensive financial planning services at a low cost, making it a good option for investors seeking professional advice. Investment Guidance Training Services: Mark Zoril of PlanVision offers training services that guide investors to open low-cost brokerage accounts and build their own index fund portfolios. Investment Enhancement Services: Scott Burns of AssetBuilder provides investment enhancement services, using Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA) index funds to help investors build a \u0026ldquo;Lazy Portfolio\u0026rdquo;. The author elaborates on DFA\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy: pursuing excess returns through small-cap and value stocks. Betterment, Rebalance IRA, SigFig, and Wealthfront: These companies also offer robo-advisory services, building and managing portfolios consisting of index funds or ETFs for investors. Canadian Robo-Advisors: Lower Cost and More Targeted: Robo-advisor platforms in Canada, such as WealthBar and Wealthsimple, offer lower-cost, personalized services, tailoring portfolios to suit client risk tolerance and investment goals. The author uses personal experiences to demonstrate that Canadian bank advisors still favor actively managed funds over low-cost index funds. Tangerine: Tangerine bank provides Canadian investors with a financial product that encompasses a diversified index fund portfolio. Low cost makes it suitable for those who prefer to invest small sums regularly. The author uses 19-year-old Katie as an example to show how young people can leverage Tangerine\u0026rsquo;s investment products for regular investing. WealthBar: WealthBar offers Canadian investors five portfolio management solutions and provides comprehensive financial planning based on their risk tolerance. UK Robo-Advisors: Diversified Index Fund Baskets: UK robo-advisor platforms, like Nutmeg, construct diverse index fund portfolios for investors, rebalancing regularly, although their fees are comparatively higher. Australian Robo-Advisors: Increasing Competition and Falling Fees: The Australian robo-advisor market is highly competitive with decreasing fees. Platforms like Stockspot and Ignition Wealth offer low-cost, personalized ETF portfolio management services. Singapore Robo-Advisors: Avoid \u0026ldquo;Suicidal\u0026rdquo; Asset Allocation: Singapore\u0026rsquo;s robo-advisory market is nascent. Investors should opt for companies that don\u0026rsquo;t utilize ETFs traded on US exchanges to avoid US estate tax liabilities. Lesson Eight: Peek Inside A Pilferer’s Playbook # Identifying Financial Advisors\u0026rsquo; Tricks: Financial advisors use various tactics to persuade investors to buy actively managed funds, such as claiming that \u0026ldquo;index funds are more dangerous during downturns\u0026rdquo; or that \u0026ldquo;index funds can only achieve average returns,\u0026rdquo; both of which are misleading. Examples: When the author and his friend sought advice from financial advisors, they were aggressively steered towards actively managed funds without mention of their high fees or lower returns. One advisor even claimed index funds were riskier and that actively managed funds were better suited for navigating bear markets. Index Fund Returns Outshine \u0026ldquo;Financial Elites\u0026rdquo;: Even seasoned investment professionals like pension fund managers struggle to beat index fund returns. Many pension funds have started shifting towards indexed investments, allocating a significant portion of their funds to index funds. Example: A study by US consulting firm FutureMetrics revealed that less than 30% of large corporate pension funds outperformed a diversified portfolio holding 60% S\u0026amp;P 500 index and 40% corporate bond index. Don\u0026rsquo;t Accidentally Become a \u0026ldquo;Second-Rate Investor\u0026rdquo;: Don\u0026rsquo;t be fooled by financial advisors\u0026rsquo; sales pitches. Trust the data and facts - index funds are the most reliable way to profit in the stock market. Advisors\u0026rsquo; interests are often at odds with those of their clients; they prioritize commission income over investor returns. Lesson Nine: Avoid Seduction # Stock Picking Scams: Do their stock recommendations really work?: Investment newsletter predictions are often inaccurate, and their recommended stocks are likely to lead to financial ruin. Their primary goal is to attract subscribers, not to help investors make money. Example: The author invested in stocks recommended by \u0026ldquo;The Gilder Technology Report\u0026rdquo; and suffered significant losses. The author of that report continues to publish similar reports, using the lure of high past returns to attract investors. Investing in Emerging Markets: Don\u0026rsquo;t be fooled by GDP: High economic growth does not necessarily translate into high stock market returns. Be cautious when investing in emerging markets. They are more volatile and risky, and their long-term returns may not surpass developed markets. Example: While China\u0026rsquo;s GDP grew rapidly from 2008 to 2016, its stock market performance was lackluster, with investors in a large-cap Chinese stock ETF experiencing a 30% loss. \u0026ldquo;Gold speculation\u0026rdquo;: It\u0026rsquo;s not investing: Gold has a low long-term return rate with high price volatility, making it unsuitable for long-term investment. \u0026ldquo;Gold speculators\u0026rdquo; attempt to profit from price differences by buying low and selling high, a risky strategy that cannot guarantee stable long-term returns. Example: $1 worth of gold purchased in 1801 would only be worth $73 in 2016, whereas a $1 investment in the US stock market during the same period would turn into $16.24 million. Investment Magazines: The Untold Truth: Investment magazines rely heavily on advertising revenue, leading them to cater to their advertisers rather than prioritize investors\u0026rsquo; needs. They often recommend high-fee actively managed funds while neglecting low-cost index funds. Example: In April 2009, \u0026ldquo;SmartMoney\u0026rdquo; magazine recommended bond funds and gold, ignoring the investment opportunity presented by low-priced stocks amidst the financial crisis. Hedge Funds: Picking the Pockets of the Rich: Hedge funds charge exorbitant fees and carry significant risks, with long-term returns that are often no better, and sometimes even worse, than index funds. Their reported performance is often skewed by \u0026ldquo;survivorship bias\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;backfill bias.\u0026rdquo; Example: Hedge funds struggle to achieve an average annual compounded return of even 1%. Only one out of the top 20 largest hedge funds has outperformed the S\u0026amp;P 500 index. Don\u0026rsquo;t buy currency-hedged ETFs: Currency-hedged ETFs aim to eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on investment returns. However, the hedging mechanism itself incurs costs, decreasing a portfolio\u0026rsquo;s returns. Example: Research indicates that non-currency-hedged ETFs generally outperform their currency-hedged counterparts over the long term. Don\u0026rsquo;t fall for smart beta funds: These hybrid funds fall somewhere between active and index funds, attempting to achieve excess returns with specific strategies. Their effectiveness is debated, and their fees are generally higher. Example: Studies show that the market capitalization growth of smart beta funds has been primarily due to valuation increases, not corporate earnings growth, suggesting potential decreases in future returns. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly buy into small-cap stocks: Small-cap stocks, those of smaller companies, offer high growth potential, but also carry higher risk. Investing in them requires careful consideration and risk tolerance; avoid chasing high returns blindly. III. Key Quotes # You don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a financial expert; even with a moderate income, you can achieve financial freedom through prudent spending and rational investing.\nThis encapsulates the core message of the book: financial management and investment are not exclusive to the wealthy; ordinary people can also achieve financial freedom through learning and practical application.\nTime is money.\nThis emphasizes that time is our most valuable asset. The earlier you start investing, the longer the time horizon for compound interest to work its magic, leading to faster wealth accumulation.\nA successful investor should follow two principles: the first is to never lose money and the second is to never forget the first principle.\nThis quote highlights the importance of risk management and capital preservation in investing.\nThe investor\u0026rsquo;s task is to focus on the horse, not the jockey.\nThis means that investors should prioritize a company\u0026rsquo;s intrinsic value over the fund manager\u0026rsquo;s individual ability. Over the long run, a company\u0026rsquo;s profitability is the most important factor determining its stock price.\nIf you plan to live off hamburgers for the rest of your life, but you don\u0026rsquo;t own any cattle, would you want beef prices to go up or down?\nBuffett used this analogy to illustrate that stocks represent ownership in a company. When share prices fall, long-term investors should view it as an opportunity to buy more shares.\nThe most insidious devil is the high cost associated with holding certain actively managed funds.\nThis quote emphasizes that investment costs are one of the most important factors affecting investment returns. Choosing low-cost index funds maximizes gains.\nHow much you can accumulate in your lifetime depends not on how much you can earn, but on how you invest. Money finds people more effectively than people find money.

Concentrating your investments in a few high-quality assets and holding them for the long term often yields better results.\nIn stock investing, luck inevitably plays a role, but in the long run, good luck and bad luck offset each other. For sustained success, skills and sound principles are essential.\nThis emphasizes that the key to successful investing lies in mastering the correct investment philosophy and principles and adhering to them in the long term, rather than relying on luck.\nLet time and money work for you; you just need to sit back and wait for the results.\nThis emphasizes the power of long-term investment and compound interest. By choosing the right investment method and being patient, significant returns will follow.\nIV.

Main Topic # The theme of this session is Embrace the New Bull Market and Invest Long-Term. James believes that the global monetary easing policy and the rapid development of AI technology herald the arrival of a new bull market. He advises everyone to invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ or 00662) and view market fluctuations with a long-term perspective.\nII. Content Summary # A new bull market is coming: The world has entered an era of loose monetary policy with the start of a rate cut cycle, which will drive the stock market up. This bull market may be a slow one but will continuously rise. Invest confidently in the Nasdaq 100 index fund: QQQ could increase by 50 times in the next 20 years, with an annualized return of over 20%, making it the best investment target. Individual stocks are unreliable: Individual stock investment is risky, and in the long run, almost all of them will disappear. They are very difficult to outperform the market in the long term. It is recommended not to waste time and energy on stock selection. Do not invest in the Chinese stock market: The Chinese stock market is not mature enough; consider investing in it after 30 years. Comparison of household asset allocation in the US and Taiwan: American families invest most of their assets in securities to create social value, while Taiwanese families prefer cash, insurance, and real estate, locking up funds in non-appreciating areas. Leveraging through stock pledges: Using stock pledges to borrow increases liquidity and allows for continued investment to enjoy the benefits of compound growth. With an understanding of asset allocation, the interest cost of borrowing can be almost negligible. Plan for retirement early: Young people are advised to invest in 00662, and retirees can choose 00646 (SPY) or 0056 according to their fund size. Emphasize family education: Parents should cultivate their children\u0026rsquo;s financial management concepts from an early age, guide them to make long-term investments, stay away from bad habits such as short-term speculation and gambling, and lead by example. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly trust high-yield investment products: Any investment product promising high returns may be a scam. It is important to understand its operating mechanism and learn to discern between true and false. The dangers of short-term trading: Short-term trading will miss the best investment opportunities. Long-term investment in index funds will yield more stable returns. The purpose of cash allocation: It is not for profit, but for dealing with emergencies like unemployment or a market crash. It is advisable to keep more than 10% of your assets in cash. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Retired Doctor Poch:\nSharing: After learning about James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy, he found a more relaxing and suitable investment method. Question: How to obtain a stable cash flow after retirement? Is it necessary to adjust the investment strategy of 00662? Answer: The investment target can be adjusted according to the size of the retirement fund. Choose 00646 (SPY) or 0056 with lower volatility to guarantee cash flow. IM:\nSharing: He tried to guide his child to invest by matching contributions and increased his vigilance against high-yield traps. Question 1: How to guide a child to invest and prevent them from spending investment income? Answer: Emphasize that investment is a long-term behavior. Income cannot be withdrawn for consumption. Funds should grow continuously through compound interest. Question 2: How to choose a safe and reliable trust company? How to avoid the traps of high-yield trust products? Answer: Any trust company that promises high returns may be a scam. You should take control of your own investment and financial management rights, clearly stipulate investment in index funds in the trust clause, and set up a regulatory unit to ensure fund security. Rose:\nSharing: She frankly talked about her past investment failures and the process of gradually establishing the correct investment concept under the guidance of James. Question 1: What are the differences and pros and cons of Margin Loan and Pledge Loan? The interest rate of Margin Loan from IB is relatively low. Is it necessary to transfer to Charles Schwab for Pledge Loan? Answer: Margin Loan is riskier, and Pledge Loan is relatively safe. If the interest rate of IB\u0026rsquo;s Margin Loan is low, you can continue to use it, but pay attention to controlling the borrowing ratio, preferably no more than 20%. Question 2: The return on cash allocation will decrease in the interest rate cut cycle. Is it still necessary to allocate cash? Answer: The purpose of cash allocation is not for profit but to deal with contingencies, such as unemployment or a market crash. It is advisable to keep more than 10% of your assets in cash. Question 3: How to manage children\u0026rsquo;s investment accounts? Under whose name should it be, yours or the child\u0026rsquo;s? Answer: It is recommended to open an account in the child\u0026rsquo;s name to cultivate their financial management concept, but control the amount and provide proper investment guidance. Estate planning can be done after the child becomes an adult. Phoenix:\nSharing: He shared his confusion about handling company stock options and finally adopted James\u0026rsquo; suggestion. Question 1: How to deal with the stock options of unlisted companies? Answer: If the company has a high possibility of going public, it is recommended to sell it to an investment company before the listing to get cash and invest in QQQ. Question 2: What do you think of Bitcoin? Can I invest in it? Answer: If you already hold a small amount of Bitcoin, you can continue to hold it, but do not invest any more capital. It is recommended to focus on investing in QQQ. Allen:\nSharing: He shared his questions about 401k and stock investment and eventually made adjustments under James\u0026rsquo; advice. Question 1: What should I do if I have too much money in my 401k account? Answer: It is recommended to stop making further contributions to 401k and transfer some funds to the Roth IRA account through the Backdoor Roth IRA.

Haoqing:\nSharing: He demonstrated the difficulty of stock selection through data analysis and illustrated the advantages of long-term investment in QQQ with practical examples. Question: Can stock picking beat QQQ? Answer: Stock selection is difficult to outperform QQQ in the long run. Even if it beats the market in the short term, transaction costs and taxes need to be considered. Invest in index funds for the long term. Xiang:\nSharing: He shared his confusion about saving for children\u0026rsquo;s education and inheritance and finally found a solution under James\u0026rsquo; advice. Question 1: Is it better to use a 529 Education Fund or invest in QQQ for children\u0026rsquo;s education savings? Answer: Investing in QQQ is recommended because it has higher long-term returns and is more flexible. Question 2: How to do estate planning? Answer: For larger estates, it is recommended to set up an irrevocable trust and consult an estate lawyer for planning. Kevin:\nSharing: Frankly admitted his past investment failures and regained confidence under the guidance of James, starting to embark on the road of steady investment.

Main Topic # This episode primarily discusses proper investment philosophy, ways to avoid investment traps, and the implications of China\u0026rsquo;s latest economic policies for the global market. James emphasizes the importance of long-term investment in index funds, particularly QQQ, and reminds investors to maintain emotional control and not be swayed by market fluctuations. He uses specific examples and data to illustrate the concept of \u0026ldquo;borrow for consumption, invest for asset growth,\u0026rdquo; while also analyzing China\u0026rsquo;s recently introduced series of economic stimulus policies, believing them to be a positive signal for a global economic recovery.\nII. Briefing Content # Investment Philosophy: Emotions are the biggest enemy in investing. You need to avoid being influenced by news and information, stay rational, and refrain from chasing rising or falling markets. Investing requires a long-term perspective, aiming for a timeframe of 40 years or more. Warren Buffett acquired 99% of his wealth after the age of 50, demonstrating that patience is key to wealth creation. Choose investment targets that are consistently stable and provide high returns. Index funds are the best option, especially QQQ, which boasts a long-term annualized return of 14%. Adhere to the \u0026ldquo;never sell\u0026rdquo; strategy to allow assets to continue appreciating. Avoid selling stocks unless absolutely necessary. Scam Avoidance Guide: Be wary of various investment traps. Do not trust any projects that guarantee high returns, especially those that require you to sell existing assets for new investments. Do not readily believe any investment or financial management information received via phone, text messages, or online platforms. Any information involving bank accounts or government departments must be verified through official channels. Be cautious of aggressive sales tactics from financial institutions. Stick to your investment plan and avoid being lured by various fancy financial products. Regarding Real Estate Investment: James advises against homeownership for average working individuals, believing it turns them into \u0026ldquo;mortgage slaves\u0026rdquo; burdened with heavy loan pressure, hindering wealth accumulation. He advocates for a \u0026ldquo;rent instead of buy\u0026rdquo; approach, suggesting using a stock pledge loan to rent high-quality housing at lower interest rates, then investing the saved funds for higher returns. Consider purchasing real estate only when your assets reach a certain scale and you can comfortably afford the payment. New Trends in China\u0026rsquo;s Economy: The People\u0026rsquo;s Bank of China recently introduced a series of potent fiscal policies, including reserve requirement ratio and interest rate cuts, injecting funds into banks, and encouraging stock purchases, to stimulate economic growth. These policies will contribute positively to stabilizing China\u0026rsquo;s real estate market, boosting consumer confidence, and promoting global economic recovery. Investors should pay attention to developments in the Chinese market and seize new investment opportunities. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IM:\nSharing: Through conversations with individuals of different age groups, IM discovered that most people have insufficient awareness of long-term savings and are often constrained by mortgages and other factors. By comparing the returns of index funds in different countries and regions with those of fixed deposits and pensions, IM illustrated the advantages of long-term investment in index funds. INGYNYING:\nSharing: INGYNYING\u0026rsquo;s mother wanted to sell all her assets to purchase a house but, after persuasion, realized that this would lead to losing opportunities for asset appreciation. Many of INGYNYING\u0026rsquo;s friends are afraid of change, preferring to endure the hardships of their current situation rather than attempt new investment methods. Question: How to convince family members to accept new investment concepts? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Utilize data and case studies for illustration, such as comparing the long-term returns of fixed deposits and index funds, and sharing success stories of investors. It\u0026rsquo;s also important to respect family members\u0026rsquo; choices and refrain from forcing them to accept new ideas. Allen:\nQuestions: Should someone with assets worth 50 times their annual living expenses use their salary to pay for a car? How can a couple combine their stock accounts for collateral purposes? James\u0026rsquo; answer: It is recommended to utilize Tesla\u0026rsquo;s official website loan to purchase a vehicle, then use funds from a stock pledge loan to repay the car loan. Dedicate your salary entirely to investment. Couples can combine their accounts through a joint account for collateral, sharing the limit, while their accounts remain individually managed. Eric:\nQuestion: Eric\u0026rsquo;s mother is visiting the US and is concerned about medical expenses. How should this be handled? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Purchasing travel insurance is advised, but excessive worry is unnecessary. Most non-emergency situations can be treated back home. If encountering extremely high medical costs, attempting negotiation with the hospital or seeking alternative solutions is possible. Due to the specific circumstances of foreign nationality and lack of income, the hospital may choose not to pursue the medical expenses. Dean:\nSharing: Dean purchased a new car using Tesla\u0026rsquo;s website loan and a stock pledge loan, conserving a significant amount of capital. Learning about investing boosted Dean\u0026rsquo;s confidence to decline a high-paying job and choose to stay home with their child. Michael:\nQuestions: How to secure a loan from Tesla\u0026rsquo;s official website for a car purchase? Can funds from 401k or IRA accounts be used for collateral? What are the options if QQQ is not available in their company\u0026rsquo;s 401k plan? James\u0026rsquo; answer: To apply for a car loan through Tesla\u0026rsquo;s website, choose the desired model and configuration, click \u0026ldquo;Order Now\u0026rdquo;, and select \u0026ldquo;Finance\u0026rdquo;. Funds in retirement accounts cannot be used as collateral; it is recommended to transfer part of those funds to a brokerage account for collateral purposes. Alternative options include choosing an S\u0026amp;P 500 index fund or inquiring with the company about the possibility of Blockage Link to invest in QQQ. EVA:\nQuestion: As a single, middle-aged woman with limited savings, how to balance work and investment? Should selling the house be considered for investment purposes? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Continue working diligently while consistently making monthly investments. Even small amounts will accumulate over 8-9 years, reaching the threshold for collateral, allowing you to leverage and accelerate wealth growth. Selling a house for investment is an option but requires careful consideration based on personal circumstances. If renting is more cost-effective, choose to rent and allocate the funds to investments yielding higher returns. Jenny:\nQuestions: Any knowledge regarding the latest Roth SEP IRA policy? James\u0026rsquo; answer: The policy information is quite recent, and the accuracy of the $69,000 limit requires verification. Consulting with professionals like a financial advisor at Chase or Lisa is recommended. As it is a new product, not all institutions may offer it. Sharing: Jenny shared a personal experience of being scammed, reminding everyone to exercise caution and avoid trusting any investment information, particularly those spread through unofficial channels. Haoqing:\nSharing: Haoqing relayed the experiences of close friends falling victim to scams, lamenting that scam tactics are constantly evolving and are hard to guard against, even for highly educated individuals. Question: How can investment concepts be better conveyed to people around us to prevent them from being deceived? Is there a need to explain professional investment knowledge? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Avoid explaining intricate investment knowledge; simply emphasize the core principle of long-term investment in index funds. Excessive professional details may confuse them, making them more susceptible to being misled by other investment information and ultimately falling prey to scams. Jason:\nSharing: Recounted an NFT scam incident encountered on Clubhouse, warning everyone to be wary of risks in the cryptocurrency world. Expressed gratitude toward James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy for helping them avoid such traps. Amy:\nSharing: Amy shared personal encounters with scams, including impersonations of government departments and courier companies. She emphasized the importance of relying only on written communication and ignoring any investment information delivered through phone calls or text messages. Amy suggested that, when in doubt, contact official channels for clarification. Becky:\nSuggestion: Avoid answering calls from unfamiliar numbers, set up spam filters, and use a less important email address when necessary to share personal information to minimize the risk of scams. Mike:\nQuestion: What are your thoughts on China\u0026rsquo;s most recent economic policies? Are they sustainable? James\u0026rsquo; answer: The People\u0026rsquo;s Bank of China has introduced powerful policies that are having a positive impact on economic confidence. Investors should keep an eye on these developments. Although the policies appear to be heading in a positive direction, their sustainability remains to be seen. Julia:\nQuestion: Any updates on the Roth SEP IRA policy? Are there any financial institutions already offering related products? James\u0026rsquo; answer: The policy information is fairly new, and the $69,000 limit\u0026rsquo;s accuracy is debatable. Consulting with a professional is advised. Being a new product, not all institutions might offer it yet. IV. Noteworthy Points # “You have enough money when you have enough.\u0026quot; \u0026ndash; Many people\nMany individuals believe that having just enough to get by is sufficient. This is a mistaken notion, as money is never truly enough. True financial freedom lies in possessing the power of choice – going wherever you want, doing whatever you desire – instead of being constrained by finances.\n\u0026ldquo;Never borrow money for investments.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; Many people\nMany believe that borrowing for investment is unwise; however, this viewpoint is overly cautious. True investors, like Warren Buffett, skillfully leverage debt. Following the principle of \u0026ldquo;borrow for consumption, invest for asset growth\u0026rdquo;, the correct approach is to use borrowed money for expenses and personal money for investment. This enables rapid wealth accumulation.\n“All investment information received through phone calls, text messages, or online platforms is not trustworthy.” \u0026ndash; James\nNowadays, numerous scams operate through these channels. It\u0026rsquo;s crucial to exercise caution and avoid blindly believing any financial advice or information. Anything involving bank accounts or government departments must be verified through official sources. Additionally, seeking guidance from qualified professionals is essential.\n“Investment must be consistently stable over the long term, which is why index funds are the only viable option.\u0026quot; \u0026ndash; James\nWithin the complex investment landscape, index funds stand out as a few reliable options capable of offering consistent stability and high returns. Index funds are like living organisms; they will never die, whereas all individual stocks will eventually disappear within a century. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for generational wealth, index funds are the way to go.\nV. Summary # This episode is packed with valuable information and insights. It not only reiterates the importance of long-term index fund investment but also offers practical tips on scam prevention and provides an in-depth analysis of China\u0026rsquo;s newest economic policies. It is recommended to apply this knowledge to your investment practices and strive for financial freedom.\nDisclaimer: This article serves solely as personal study notes and does not constitute any investment advice.

Topic of the Session # The session centered on the core principle of long-term investment strategies. James reiterated his investment philosophy: \u0026ldquo;Buy QQQ whenever you have money and hold it for the long term.\u0026rdquo; The discussion expanded to cover aspects like investment philosophy, risk management, and values, incorporating current events and questions from attendees. James also shared insights from legendary investors like Warren Buffett, encouraging attendees to cultivate a sound investment mindset.\nII. Briefing Highlights # Buying at the Dip vs. Buying When You Have Money: James cited research from ChatGPT, indicating that even with the ability to accurately predict and buy at market dips, the long-term returns differed minimally compared to simply buying when one has available funds. Over a 20-year period, the difference was merely 8%, translating to a difference in annualized returns of less than 0.2%. Hence, rather than expending time and effort predicting market bottoms, it\u0026rsquo;s more effective to seize opportunities and buy QQQ when you have the money. Risks of Leveraged Funds: Using the 2000 tech bubble as an example, James explained how leveraged funds can accelerate losses in bear markets, potentially leading to devastating financial setbacks, even bankruptcy. He simulated a scenario where an investor repeatedly buys more leveraged funds as the market declines, culminating in financial ruin. This served as a cautionary tale against the \u0026ldquo;buy the dip\u0026rdquo; strategy with leveraged funds, emphasizing the importance of risk management. Keys to Investment Success: James emphasized that the key to successful investment lies in overcoming human weaknesses. Maintaining a detached and \u0026ldquo;unfeeling\u0026rdquo; attitude towards invested capital and short-term market fluctuations is crucial for adhering to a long-term investment approach. Market Cycles: James stated he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t teach attendees about predicting market cycles or any trading techniques. He considers these unimportant and prone to misinterpretation and misapplication, potentially leading to increased risks. He advocated for a long-term investment strategy, likening it to riding a cable car, a smooth and steady ascent to the summit of financial success. Money and Values: Acknowledging that individuals have different values regarding money, James advised understanding and respecting diverse values, discouraging attempts to impose one\u0026rsquo;s own values upon others. He used the example shared by an attendee about a mother preferring a financial subsidy over a family trip to illustrate the diverse ways people assign value to things. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IIM:\nShared: A story about a deceased friend, leading to reflections on money and values, and expressing confusion about balancing personal values with those of others. Question 1: How to understand some people\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;frugality\u0026rdquo; with money while being \u0026ldquo;generous\u0026rdquo; towards their pets. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: People manage their finances differently based on what they consider important and valuable. What might be significant to one person may hold little value for another. Question 2: How to understand a mother who prioritizes money over a family trip? How to better understand the needs of others? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This mother might have certain unmet needs, possibly requiring material security before pursuing leisurely experiences. Understanding true needs involves offering more choices (e.g., money plus a trip). Avoid trying to change others\u0026rsquo; values; focus on understanding and respecting them. Brian:\nShared: Encountering a friend who suggested leveraging to purchase Nvidia stock, leading to questions about investment advice. Question: How to evaluate investment advice received from others? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The validity of investment advice depends on individual judgment and risk tolerance. It\u0026rsquo;s important to avoid blindly following the advice of others and to think independently. Iny:\nShared: Experiencing a sense of calm and reduced anxiety after adopting James\u0026rsquo;s investment approach. This newfound peace of mind allows for dedicating more time to important matters like family, and interestingly, focusing on work has led to increased income. Question: How to understand the phenomenon of increased income resulting from a dedicated focus on work? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This exemplifies the principle that altruism ultimately benefits oneself. By focusing on serving clients and enhancing product or service quality, one ultimately gains client recognition and rewards, leading to higher income and a sense of accomplishment. Haoqing:\nShared 1: An experience with check fraud, prompting concerns about bank security and the risks of using checks. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Banks do not verify the identity of check depositors. Checks present security vulnerabilities, making it advisable to use safer online banking and digital payment methods like Apple Pay. Shared 2: Thoughts on the decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia, attributing this to factors like US regulations, labor laws, and unions. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia are multifaceted issues stemming from a complex interplay of factors, including national policies, labor laws, and unions. While Asian countries might resort to suppressing labor rights and environmental regulations to gain a competitive edge, the US places a higher value on worker well-being and environmental protection. This divergence in values contributes to different developmental paths. Becky:\nShared: Based on personal experience working in a digital payment company, Becky recommended that everyone stop using checks due to inherent security risks. Digital payment methods offer greater security and convenience, with features such as spending alerts that enable prompt response and recovery in case of issues. Mike:\nShared: As a long-time follower of James, Mike witnessed the evolution of his investment philosophy, from initially holding 30% SPY to converting to 100% QQQ, and eventually incorporating leveraged funds. He also shared personal investment experiences, like selling NIO and allocating a portion of his portfolio to private market investments. Question 1: Is investing in Intel after its acquisition worthwhile? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: James advised against investing in large companies that are acquisitive. Acquisitions often lack efficiency, posing integration challenges and potentially hindering productivity. While acquiring smaller companies for technological advantages makes sense, acquiring large companies is akin to amassing a pile of scrap metal. Question 2: How to view the supply chain security concerns stemming from the US outsourcing 3C product manufacturing, citing examples like the BBB Call explosion and walkie-talkie incidents? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Espionage is ubiquitous, and supply chain security is just one facet of this broader issue. Governments might implant spy codes in chips and software for surveillance purposes. Explosions are a relatively rudimentary form of espionage; more sophisticated methods can be extremely difficult to detect and prevent. Question 3: Is it possible to offer advanced courses for more experienced attendees? He suggested using portfolio sharing as a means to differentiate attendees\u0026rsquo; learning progress. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: James stated he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t differentiate between attendees nor offer advanced courses. Assessing whether a student is genuinely learning is primarily based on their attitude, not investment returns or holding duration. Even portfolio sharing can\u0026rsquo;t truly gauge learning progress. James mentioned his personal sensitivity to words and language, enabling him to discern learning attitudes from attendees\u0026rsquo; emails and the way they pose questions. IV. Noteworthy Insights # The best time to buy is when you have money. \u0026ndash; James\nMany obsess over finding the perfect entry point, but research indicates that even if you could perfectly time market dips, the long-term returns barely differ from simply buying when funds are available. Instead of wasting time trying to predict the market, seize the opportunity and act promptly.\nTo succeed in investing, you must be indifferent to the money you invest and the fluctuations in stock prices. \u0026ndash; James\nOvercoming the human tendency to fixate on money and fear short-term market swings is essential for maintaining a long-term investment strategy and achieving stable returns.\nTo achieve effortless investing, you need to be numb to money. \u0026ndash; James\nWhen investing becomes a habit, free from emotional impulses and external distractions, you can achieve optimal results.\nThe concept of a \u0026ldquo;benefactor\u0026rdquo; is relative. \u0026ndash; James\nPeople perceive and absorb information differently. Who you consider a benefactor might not be perceived as such by others.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t try to change other people\u0026rsquo;s values. \u0026ndash; James\nEveryone has their own values and ways of life. It\u0026rsquo;s important to understand and respect diverse choices.\nEspionage is everywhere. \u0026ndash; James\nInformation security is a growing concern. Be vigilant and protect your personal data.\nAcquisitions of large companies are generally inefficient, and leaders who are fond of acquisitions usually have inflated egos. \u0026ndash; James\nIntegration complexities and high management costs associated with mergers often outweigh the benefits gained.\nThe US excels in areas such as finance and technology design, while Asian countries can only substitute and supplement in specific aspects. \u0026ndash; Haoqing\nWithin the global division of labor, different countries have distinct strengths and weaknesses, leading to divergent paths of development.\nThe best judgments are validated by facts. \u0026ndash; Mike\nThe success of an investment philosophy is ultimately determined by its long-term returns, not short-term fluctuations or gut feelings.\nYour attitude determines my response. \u0026ndash; James\nJames adjusts his responses based on the learning attitude of the attendees. Attendees who are truly dedicated to learning will receive greater guidance.\nInvesting in individual stocks will ultimately lead to bankruptcy; holding onto individual stocks will also ultimately lead to bankruptcy.\n\u0026ndash; James\nCompanies have lifecycles. Holding onto a single stock long term significantly increases the risk of encountering bankruptcy. Diversification is key in investing.\nV. Summary # This live session once again emphasized the importance of long-term investing while reminding attendees to stay rational, patient, and vigilant. James addressed attendees\u0026rsquo; questions regarding investment strategies, risk management, and the relationship between money and values, sharing personal experiences and insights. Key takeaways include avoiding market timing, leveraged funds, and individual stock investments, and embracing an attitude of indifference towards money.

Theme of the Episode # The theme of this episode is \u0026ldquo;Investing and Financial Management, Wealth is a Gift.\u0026rdquo; The core viewpoints are: Wealth is innate, but one must be informed to realize it; investing and financial management is an important way to accumulate wealth; index investing is an effective method to achieve long-term stable growth; rational asset allocation and risk control are the keys to investment success; and overcoming psychological barriers in investment and solidifying the long-term investment philosophy are crucial to ultimately achieving financial freedom.\nII. Summary of the Briefing # Wealth is a Gift: Wealth is innate, and being informed of this fact makes a huge difference. While successful entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are a minority, most people need to be told that \u0026ldquo;wealth is a gift,\u0026rdquo; and they need to learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth. The Power of Index Investing and Compound Interest: Index investing is an effective way to achieve long-term stable returns, and its compounding effect is astonishing. For example, investing $1,500 per month for 40 years with a 14% annualized return will yield $2.6 million. Even small amounts of money can accumulate considerable wealth through consistent long-term investment. High Risk, High Return?: High risk doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily lead to high returns. Whether you can bear the risk determines whether you can ultimately achieve high returns. Don\u0026rsquo;t overestimate your risk tolerance. Your risk appetite should be determined by an asset allocation that you can withstand even if your investment goes to zero. For example, if you cannot afford the risk of TQQQ going to zero, you should not invest in TQQQ. Choosing Investment Targets: It is recommended to invest in the global Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ). Those with insufficient funds or who are already retired can consider investing in SPY or high-dividend ETFs. Avoid investing in individual stocks because they tend to disappear over the long term, while index funds can continue to exist. The half-life of individual stocks is 10 years; out of 100 stocks, there may be less than three left after 50 years. Investment Mindset: The market will eventually rise, and investment requires patience. Always stay optimistic, even if the investment goes to zero. Learning about investing and financial management requires continuous thinking, like peeling an onion, layer by layer, to elevate the energy of the spiritual level. Investing is like the Yellow Mountain, eternally unchanging, yet different every day; every learning experience will bring new insights. Asset Allocation: Asset allocation is like building a house; it is a big project that requires comprehensive planning, not something simple. It is necessary to consider many factors, such as whether you are retired, your age, income, debt, and cash flow, to formulate a reasonable asset allocation plan. You need to carefully study the articles and videos on asset allocation provided by James to develop a plan that suits you. Do Not Blindly Trust External Information: Financial professionals often only consider their interests, so do not easily believe their advice. Think independently, study carefully, and do not be swayed by external information and noise. Most of the outside information is garbage; do not be affected by it, focus on learning James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy. Balancing Risk and Reward: Do not excessively pursue high returns or completely risk-free investments; balance risk and reward. Avoid changing investment strategies easily to prevent additional costs due to frequent trading. James\u0026rsquo; investment methods can guarantee asset appreciation and relative safety, avoiding extreme situations. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IM:\nSharing: Learning about investment is like peeling an onion; at first, the amount of information is overwhelming, but as you learn more, you will gradually understand the core idea and ultimately reach the realm of \u0026ldquo;the great Dao is simple.\u0026rdquo;\nQuestion 1: What do you think about the idea that \u0026ldquo;investing is simple\u0026rdquo;?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: Such views often mistake ignorance for inaction and do not truly understand the complexity and risks of investment. Question 2: How should we communicate with friends who don\u0026rsquo;t understand index investing?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: You can start by briefly introducing the concept and advantages of index investing and suggest that they watch related videos to learn. Don\u0026rsquo;t force them to accept it, everyone has their own choices. Just like preaching, we can only try our best to spread the message; whether it\u0026rsquo;s ultimately accepted depends on the individual. LAN:\nQuestion 1: How to calculate Beta? What is the actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: You can refer to the link to the article on Beta calculation on the message board. The actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF may deviate from the theoretical value due to factors such as market volatility and friction costs. When market volatility is large, the wear and tear of leveraged ETFs will be more serious, resulting in an actual Beta value lower than the theoretical value. Question 2: Why is there a huge difference in final return between scenario 3 and scenario 4.1 in the 005 topic?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: Scenario 4.1 is where no money is withdrawn from the investment, so the final return will be higher. Question 3: How to adjust Beta in a rising market?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: The adjustment of Beta should be determined by your own risk tolerance, not by the market trend. Do not try to predict the market, just keep a fixed Beta value. Question 4: For investments in Taiwan, should I choose Q2D or 00670L?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: 00670L is recommended because it includes New Taiwan dollar hedging, which can reduce the risk caused by exchange rate fluctuations. Don\u0026rsquo;t change investment targets frequently, choose one that suits you and hold it for the long term. Nai Xin:\nSharing: Wealth is a gift, just as self-confidence is a gift; everyone has potential, but it needs to be stimulated. The key to investing and financial management lies in learning. Once you have mastered the correct investment method, you can focus on your own career and life and let wealth grow naturally over time. Overcome fear, build confidence, and you can realize your potential, gain wealth, and achieve success. Jason:\nSharing: Understanding \u0026ldquo;buy whenever you have money,\u0026rdquo; but still finding it difficult to overcome psychological fluctuations when the market rises or falls sharply. James\u0026rsquo; Response: Overcoming psychological fluctuations takes time and experience. You can try to make a small number of trades, experience the impact of market fluctuations, and gradually adapt to market changes. IM Supplement: You can overcome psychological barriers by imagining starting to invest two years later and understanding that \u0026ldquo;money arrives at different points in time.\u0026rdquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about buying at the lowest point; as long as you stick to long-term investment, you can get good returns. Hai Rui Ji:\nSharing:\nThank you James for selflessly sharing your investment philosophy; students learn from each other and make progress together. James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy requires continuous learning and understanding to grasp it fully. \u0026ldquo;Never sell\u0026rdquo; does not mean you cannot sell, but that you should develop a reasonable investment strategy based on your own situation. ** \u0026ldquo;Never sell\u0026rdquo; refers to mentally ignoring market fluctuations and adhering to a long-term investment philosophy.** Investment philosophy needs to keep pace with the times and adjust investment strategies according to changes in the environment. Question: Already answered in the video.\nLi Zi:\nSharing: To overcome psychological barriers to investment, manage accounts separately, using one part for long-term investment and the other for tentative operations, such as selling covered calls. This satisfies the desire to trade and avoids losses due to frequent trading. James\u0026rsquo; Response: You only know what is best after you have experienced it. Experience in trading can lead to a firmer commitment to a long-term investment strategy. Trying different trading strategies can help you understand the advantages of long-term investment and ultimately achieve the state of \u0026ldquo;daily reduction for the Dao.\u0026rdquo; T:\nQuestion 1: Why has the capital market in mainland China performed poorly for a long time?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: Emerging markets take time to mature. The Chinese market is like the Taiwanese market 50 years ago. It has the potential to rise in the long term, but its return may be lower than that of the US market. Investment should focus on sustainable development markets. The US market has advantages in terms of systems and industries. Question 2: Under foreign exchange control, how do I invest in US index funds? Are there any risks?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: You can invest by purchasing ETFs listed in China that track US index funds, such as 513100. Foreign exchange controls mainly restrict the physical flow of funds, and buying ETFs is not restricted. The current scale of such investment is small and will not trigger a quota limit. Even with foreign exchange control, it is still possible to allocate global assets through legal channels. IV. Key Takeaways # Wealth is a Gift \u0026ndash; James\nEveryone has the potential for wealth, but they must be informed to realize it and learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth.\nLearning Increases Daily, the Dao Decreases Daily \u0026ndash; IM\nLearning about investing and financial management is a process of continuous improvement. At first, you will be exposed to a large amount of information, but as your understanding deepens, you will gradually simplify your investment strategy and eventually reach the state of \u0026ldquo;the great Dao is simple.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Difficult to Return to After Seeing a Vast Ocean \u0026ndash; Li Zi \u0026amp; James\nOnly after experiencing something can you know what is best. In investing, only after actually operating and experiencing market fluctuations and the impact of different investment strategies can you more firmly choose the long-term investment strategy that suits you.\nThe More Money You Borrow, the More Money You Have \u0026ndash; James\nUnderstand and control risk, not avoid it. Understanding how to use leverage can accelerate wealth growth, but only with proper risk management, such as building a solid asset allocation.\nCash is Air \u0026ndash; James\nCash is very important and you must keep enough cash to deal with market fluctuations and emergencies.\nV. Summary # This live stream focused on the theme of \u0026ldquo;Wealth is a gift.\u0026rdquo; James explained the importance of investing and financial management, the advantages of index investing, the relationship between risk tolerance and investment returns, and how to conduct reasonable asset allocation in a simple and profound way. During the Q\u0026amp;A session, students actively questioned their own issues and confusions. James patiently and meticulously answered them by combining practical cases and his own experience, helping the students better understand and master the knowledge and methods of investing and financial management. He also guided the students to overcome psychological barriers in investments, establish a firm long-term investment philosophy, and ultimately achieve financial freedom.\nDisclaimer: This article is a personal learning summary and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Topic # This session focused on the nature of capitalism and a brainless investment strategy. James criticized the current financial education system for \u0026ldquo;enslaving\u0026rdquo; the masses, arguing that it\u0026rsquo;s designed to create workers, not capitalists. He stressed the importance of asset allocation and understanding the true meaning of wealth to achieve financial freedom in a capitalist society.\nII. Briefing Content # The Essence of Capitalism: James likened capitalism to a massive AI, with complex and opaque operating mechanisms that can easily lead to confusion. He argued that capitalism is not inherently evil but a tool, the key being the user\u0026rsquo;s mindset and approach. Similar to the emergence of AI, capitalism also evolved from simple buy-and-sell relationships, its complexity making it difficult to predict and understand. Brainless Investing Strategy: \u0026ldquo;Buy when you have money, and never sell.\u0026rdquo; He emphasized index fund investing, particularly the Nasdaq-100 index fund (QQQ), as the core investment vehicle. He opposed over-diversification, believing that focusing on the US market is more effective due to its fairness, justice, and openness. The Importance of Asset Allocation: Asset allocation is the core of investing, and it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to develop a suitable strategy based on individual circumstances. James provided relevant links and video resources to help the audience learn more. A safe and sound asset allocation should be able to cope with market fluctuations, ensuring that even if the market drops to zero, one can still maintain their lifestyle for many years. He highlighted the concept of \u0026ldquo;being able to live comfortably for over a decade regardless of market fluctuations.\u0026rdquo; The True Meaning of Financial Freedom: True financial freedom is not just about possessing wealth but also about \u0026ldquo;knowing how to spend.\u0026rdquo; This means understanding one\u0026rsquo;s asset situation and knowing how much can be freely spent annually and monthly. He emphasized the concept of \u0026ldquo;knowing what to spend and spending it freely when desired.\u0026rdquo; Parenting and Responsibility: He encouraged young people to have children and cultivate their sense of responsibility and financial awareness from a young age, enabling them to be self-reliant. He shared his experience of educating his daughter, emphasizing the importance of letting children bear the consequences of their actions, starting with small things. The Meaning of Learning: The purpose of learning is not just for monetary gain but for ultimate enlightenment. One should absorb knowledge like a sponge, cultivate thinking abilities, and ultimately reach the state of \u0026ldquo;decreasing knowledge to gain wisdom.\u0026rdquo; He used the example of martial arts manuals to illustrate that learning is a process from having something to having nothing. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # YJ:\nSharing: Discussed the lack of financial education in Asia, using the moon analogy to illustrate the differences between Eastern and Western education. Mentioned the inspirational Jewish financial education book, Talmud. Question: How to educate children about finances from a young age. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Cultivate children\u0026rsquo;s sense of responsibility from an early age, let them understand the meaning of wealth, and encourage them to start financial planning and investment early. Avoid the negative views on money held by older generations. Ying Nuo:\nSharing: Shared the enlightenment gained after learning James\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy and how they implemented a simple asset allocation strategy, feeling secure and stable. Question: Question about the pledging ratio. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Corrected the concept of the pledging ratio, emphasizing that retirees should pledge or borrow 2% of their total assets for living expenses, and young people should choose QQQ for better growth potential. IM:\nSharing: Shared the simplicity and convenience of ETF investing, along with experiences sharing investment philosophies with friends and their views on having children. Question: Whether one should \u0026ldquo;know too much\u0026rdquo; in investing and life, and whether concerns about the future and AI would affect the willingness to have children. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Affirmed the importance of learning, but emphasized the need to learn to subtract, filtering out unimportant knowledge and information. \u0026ldquo;Gaining knowledge daily, losing wisdom daily.\u0026rdquo; Encouraged young people not to be afraid of having children, sharing his understanding of the meaning of life - \u0026ldquo;The meaning of life lies in creating the next generation of life in the universe.\u0026rdquo; Chang An:\nSharing: Shared news about a government department in China buying Nasdaq funds and becoming the largest shareholder. Question: The implications of this action and its connection to US-China relations. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Affirmed the investment behavior of the government department, believing it to be the correct way to manage finances, and encouraged other government departments to learn from it. He believed that governments should also engage in asset allocation. Sam:\nSharing: Shared entrepreneurial experiences and reflections on blind expansion, as well as personal confusion about retirement and future life. Question: Preparing for retirement but feeling lost about the future state of life and unsure how to prepare. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Retirement is not the only option, listen to your inner voice, and find a lifestyle that makes you happy. Don\u0026rsquo;t over-plan the future; things will work out. He also suggested that Sam think about streamlining company processes, improving efficiency, and making employees happier at work. Jason:\nSharing: Examples of young people staying at home after graduating from university. Question: How to help young people find meaning in life. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Cultivate children\u0026rsquo;s sense of responsibility from an early age and let them learn to be self-reliant. Parents should not over-pamper their children, let them take responsibility, and encourage them to enter society and serve others. He used his own daughter as an example to illustrate how to cultivate children\u0026rsquo;s sense of responsibility from a young age. IV. Key Takeaways # Spending money is moral. \u0026ndash; James\nSpending money should not be seen as negative; knowing how to spend and being willing to spend is the only way to truly enjoy the freedom that wealth brings. Also emphasized taking advantage of credit card benefits, points, etc.\nThe more we know, the greater the risks we don\u0026rsquo;t know. \u0026ndash; James\nAs our knowledge increases, we need to be more cautious in identifying and assessing potential unknown risks. The real risk is the unknown risk.\nThe class of those who know and those who don\u0026rsquo;t. \u0026ndash; James\nThere is a disparity in information and knowledge in capitalist society, leading to class differentiation between those who know and those who don\u0026rsquo;t. Wealth and capital are concentrated in the hands of a few.\nI may not know where I\u0026rsquo;m sailing, but I know there are some paths I can no longer take. \u0026ndash; Sam\nOn the road of life, clarifying what you don\u0026rsquo;t want is more important than knowing what you want.\nV. Conclusion # This session covered investment philosophy, life philosophy, parenting experiences, and more. James, with his unique perspective and sharp language, criticized the shortcomings of the current financial education system, proposed a \u0026ldquo;brainless investing\u0026rdquo; strategy, and emphasized the importance of asset allocation and \u0026ldquo;knowing how to spend.\u0026rdquo; He also discussed topics such as how to cultivate children\u0026rsquo;s sense of responsibility and finding one\u0026rsquo;s purpose in life, encouraging the audience to actively think about the meaning of life and contribute to society.\nDisclaimer: This article is only for personal learning notes and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Theme # This session centers around the importance of psychological resilience in investing. James\u0026rsquo;s core message is that mental strength is the key to investment success, while other skills and calculations are secondary. Investors need to maintain a highly optimistic mindset, viewing market fluctuations as opportunities rather than crises in the long run. Long-term investing, rational analysis, and maintaining a healthy mindset are more crucial than striving for precise calculations.\nII. Briefing Content # Correction on 401(k) and IRA: James corrects a statement from the previous session regarding 401(k) and IRA contribution limits, clarifying that the limits for each are independent, but that IRAs have income restrictions. He provides further explanations about the Backdoor Roth IRA conversion, advising listeners to manage pre-tax and after-tax funds carefully to avoid account confusion and complications during tax filing. Asset Allocation Strategy: He emphasizes the significance of asset allocation and suggests listeners refer to existing articles and Excel spreadsheets for simulations, discouraging impulsive decision-making. He offers various asset allocation plans catering to different risk tolerances and retirement stages, stressing the concept of \u0026ldquo;fuzzy accuracy\u0026rdquo; – that it is not necessary to pursue overly precise ratios, but ensuring sufficient cash reserves is crucial. Example: A listener proposes an allocation of 60% QQQ and 40% cash, which James believes carries a risk of bankruptcy and advises them to consult the provided asset allocation plans. Leveraged ETFs and Rebalancing: Using QQQ\u0026rsquo;s beta value of 1.0 as a benchmark, he simplifies beta calculations for leveraged ETFs, for instance, QLD is considered 2.0. He recommends a gradual approach when adjusting beta during rebalancing, advising against drastic changes. For investors with earned income, the frequency and ratio of rebalancing can be more flexible. Example: He suggests that young investors can rotate investments among QQQ, QLD, and TQQQ every six months, then rebalance at the end of the year. Long-Term Investing and Market Volatility: James reiterates the importance of long-term investing, using the dot-com bubble of 2000 as an example to demonstrate that long-term investors ultimately profit, even after enduring prolonged market downturns. Market dips are opportunities, and investors should remain optimistic, buying whenever they have funds available. He refutes the notion that \u0026ldquo;investments in 2000 took 15 years to break even,\u0026rdquo; emphasizing that the market always recovers in the long run. Example: An investment of $5 million at the peak of the market in 2000, despite experiencing the burst of the internet bubble, would still have grown to $32.375 million by 2024. Brokerage Selection: He advises choosing brokerages with physical branch offices and understanding how stocks and cash are held in custody to ensure asset security. Example: He explains the risks of nominee accounts and recommends selecting brokerages that allow for direct ownership of stocks, encouraging listeners to inquire about the brokerage\u0026rsquo;s custodian banks for stocks and cash. Purpose of Holding Cash: He underlines that cash holdings are meant for emergencies and to seize buying opportunities during market downturns, not for pursuing interest income. Example: He suggests maintaining a 20% cash position, a portion of which can be utilized for adding to leveraged ETFs during dips. Investment Target Selection: He recommends selecting suitable investment targets based on individual circumstances. For instance, retirees or individuals with limited funds may consider high-dividend ETFs, while younger individuals or those with ample funds should focus on growth-oriented ETFs like QQQ. Example: Addressing a listener holding SCH, James advises them to assess whether high-dividend ETFs are appropriate based on their asset level and annual expenses. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Danny:\nShares: He has been following James\u0026rsquo;s investment strategy for three years and achieved a return of approximately 35%. Chang\u0026rsquo;an:\nQuestion: Brokerage security and recommendations in Hong Kong. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Choose brokerages with physical branch offices in the region, understand the custodian banks for stocks and cash, and avoid easily dissolved online brokerages. Eric:\nShares: He began investing during the pandemic, experienced the hardships of short-term trading, and eventually recognized the importance of long-term investing and psychological control. He uses the example of Jesse Livermore to illustrate the risks of trading. Jessie:\nShares: Both she and her husband are nearing 60 years old, and a portion of their investment funds comes from a mortgage loan. She expresses concerns about a potential market crash and the risk of USD devaluation. Questions: How to cope with a possible future market crash, especially with a mortgage due before retirement? What about USD devaluation? Are there risks associated with concentrating large sums of money in a single brokerage account? Is it feasible to refinance the mortgage in five years or repay it early with funds from the investment account? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The market is unlikely to experience losses within a 15-year timeframe. Ensure you can comfortably handle mortgage payments for the next 13 years; the most secure approach is to sell the house and repay the loan. He declines to answer hypothetical questions. Stocks are registered under the investor\u0026rsquo;s name, hence the risk of brokerage failure is manageable. Refinancing or early repayment is not recommended. Excessive focus on short-term interest gains is akin to \u0026ldquo;penny wise, pound foolish,\u0026rdquo; and ultimately increases risk. Sam:\nShares: He went all-in on QQQ, but after some short-term trading, realized it wasn\u0026rsquo;t suitable for him and experienced psychological pressure due to large position fluctuations. Question: How to overcome the psychological pressure brought about by fluctuations in a large portfolio? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Focus on realized gains rather than unrealized gains. Maintain 20% cash and 20% leveraged ETFs to stabilize your mindset. Exercise caution with short-term trading, as it may not be sustainable in the long run. Haoqing:\nShares: He uses examples of friends gambling and raising children to illustrate the importance of moderate expectations and nurturing interests. He compares and contrasts education philosophies and Nobel Prize achievements between China and the US, emphasizing the significance of financial freedom for the next generation. IV. Highlights # Mental fortitude is the equipment for investing, it determines whether you will succeed. \u0026ndash; James\nInvestment skills and calculations are undoubtedly important, but psychological resilience is the ultimate factor that decides investment success. Even for simple index fund investing, a sound mental state is needed to navigate market volatility.\nA market downturn is not a disaster, it\u0026rsquo;s an opportunity. \u0026ndash; James\nFrom a long-term investment perspective, market downturns provide excellent opportunities to acquire high-quality assets. Maintain a long-term outlook and don\u0026rsquo;t be intimidated by short-term fluctuations.\nThere should be a limit to human pessimism. \u0026ndash; James\nExcessive pessimism and worry are detrimental to investments. One should rationally analyze risks and develop sensible coping strategies. Do not let extreme scenarios or low-probability events unduly influence investment decisions.\nParents sometimes have these expectations for their children, don\u0026rsquo;t impose your unfulfilled aspirations on them. \u0026ndash; Haoqing\nParents should respect their children\u0026rsquo;s individuality and interests and refrain from forcing their own unaccomplished goals onto them. Allowing children to have a joyful childhood and the autonomy to choose their own paths in life is more important than chasing conventional success.\nV.

Main Topic # This session centered around investment cycles, exploring how to assess market cycles, highlighting the difficulty in distinguishing between acting too early and making wrong judgments during cycle shifts. It used Buffett\u0026rsquo;s actions during the 2008 financial crisis as a case study. Additionally, it discussed risks related to real estate investment, insurance, and stock pledges, while providing an in-depth analysis of asset allocation strategies, particularly comparing and recommending approaches for the Taiwanese and US markets.\nII. Briefing Content # Investment Cycles\nInvestor sentiment is likened to a pendulum, swinging between extreme fear and extreme optimism. Differentiating between premature judgments and incorrect ones during cycle changes is challenging, as exemplified by Buffett\u0026rsquo;s public announcement of buying stocks in late 2008, followed by a further 30% market decline. Swing trading is no longer recommended, as the market perpetually rises, making long-term investment the key. Risks of Real Estate Investment\nReal estate investment is considered high-risk, requiring maintenance and incurring high holding costs like property taxes and HOA fees. US property tax is a holding tax; the longer you hold, the more tax you pay. Rental yields are low, around 2% in the US Bay Area after deducting expenses. The biggest risks of buying a house are job loss and having outstanding mortgage debt at retirement. Insurance Choices\nAvoid commercial insurance, such as life insurance, long-term care insurance, universal life insurance, etc. Necessary insurance includes health insurance and term life insurance. Term life insurance is suitable for those who are the sole income source for their family, providing support for children under 18. Risks of Stock Pledging\nStock pledging is extremely risky, especially in the Taiwanese market, with a maintenance ratio requirement of 167%. Absolutely forbid using borrowed funds from stock pledges for reinvestment. In Taiwan, leveraged ETFs can be pledged, but risks still exist. Be cautious about diversifying risks in stock pledging in Taiwan. Do not pledge all assets to the same financial institution, and avoid pledging everything at once. Taiwanese investors are advised to adopt the \u0026ldquo;Situation 3\u0026rdquo; asset allocation strategy: 30% cash, 30% leverage, and 40% QQQ or other broad-based index funds. Asset Allocation Strategies\nWhen selecting investment targets, understand their risk and return characteristics, and allocate assets reasonably based on your circumstances. Long-term investment in QQQ index funds is like piloting an aircraft carrier—stable and offering considerable returns. Investing in individual stocks and sectors is like sailing a small boat—high risk and susceptible to market fluctuations. Investments in individual stocks and sectors are similar to the once-booming railway industry, which was eventually replaced by new technologies and industries. For example, the semiconductor industry may also be eliminated in the future. QQQ index funds have a replacement mechanism to promptly remove underperforming stocks, maintaining overall growth momentum. Investing in individual stocks requires the ability to identify potential opportunities and understand market and industry trends, as exemplified by James\u0026rsquo; interaction with NVIDIA\u0026rsquo;s CEO before its IPO and his purchase of Amazon shares during its slump. For retirement accounts, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to invest all Rust account funds in leveraged ETFs, while 401K accounts can hold cash or bonds. Be cautious when borrowing for investment; ensure cash flow can cover interest payments and manage risks effectively. In the US, if capital gains tax is implemented, consider transferring funds to other countries. Avoid investing in the Chinese market due to policy risks and economic downturn pressures. Do not purchase annuity products; they offer low returns and carry risks. After selling a house, do not deposit funds into IRA or traditional IRA accounts. Be decisive in investing and avoid hesitation. For example, loss-making properties should be sold as soon as possible, and the funds should be invested in the stock market. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Eric:\nSharing: Used the analogy of QQQ index funds being like aircraft carriers and individual stocks being like small boats to illustrate the advantages of index fund investing. Sharing: James\u0026rsquo; channel not only shares investment knowledge but also many life stories, such as estate planning and tax planning, from which valuable lessons can be learned. Brian:\nQuestion: For employed individuals using the \u0026ldquo;Situation 2\u0026rdquo; asset allocation strategy, is it possible to set a higher Beta value, such as 1.1 or 1.2? Answer: There is no upper limit for Beta, as long as cash is at least twice the amount of borrowed funds. Excel spreadsheets can be used to simulate investment outcomes under different scenarios, allowing adjustments based on individual risk tolerance. Mike:\nSharing: The US is like a Bogue bird, adept at concealing its strength and waiting for the opportune moment to reap the rewards, which aligns with the long-term investment philosophy. Question: Will the central bank ignore economic recession and focus solely on inflation? Answer: The central bank will not ignore economic recession because it leads to increased unemployment, which is one of the central bank\u0026rsquo;s key concerns. Economic recession and unemployment are closely related. Cheng Ge (PC):\nSharing: Illustrated the drawbacks of investment-linked insurance policies through a real-life case study, recommending early surrender and transferring funds to QQQ index funds to recoup losses within a shorter timeframe and achieve higher returns. Lang:\nQuestion: Is it feasible to utilize market downturns to buy QLD leveraged ETFs using a Roth IRA account and convert a 401K account to cash, aiming to increase the proportion of funds in the Roth IRA account? Answer: If Rust account funds are limited, they should all be invested in leveraged ETFs. The 401K account can hold cash as a hedge. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to wait for market downturns to make the switch; asset allocation should be completed as early as possible. Tina:\nQuestion: If the 401K account is already maxed out, is it still possible to invest in an IRA account? Answer: After maxing out the 401K account, you cannot contribute to a traditional IRA account, but you can contribute to a Roth IRA account. Specific eligibility depends on income level and IRA contribution limits. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to check the IRA contribution limit for relevant information. IAM:\nQuestion: Will events like the Malaysian currency devaluation and the Hong Kong emigration wave impact the US economy and the US dollar? How does the US prevent currency devaluation? Will the companies in the QQQ index fund be affected? Answer: A country\u0026rsquo;s currency value depends on its creditworthiness, which is backed by national industries and power. The US possesses strong national strength and diversified industries, allowing the US dollar to maintain its strong position. The US government will safeguard the interests of American companies and citizens. It\u0026rsquo;s uncertain whether US companies will be directly affected by US dollar devaluation, but they will undoubtedly be protected by the US government. TT:\nQuestion: Are you still considering cycle investing at present? Answer: Yes, cycle investing will be considered, but not through the all-in, all-out approach used in the past. Instead, Beta adjustments will be employed to navigate market volatility, as it\u0026rsquo;s difficult for a large number of investors to keep up with rapid trading, thus requiring a more robust strategy. Question: Which US political party, Democrat or Republican, is more favorable to investors? Answer: In the long run, policies of both parties have minimal impact on investors. The market adjusts according to policies; for example, higher tax rates may induce investors to hold assets for longer periods. YJ:\nQuestion: Are there any differences in asset allocation strategies between Taiwan and the US? What is the role of the 00864B bond? Why is investing in 00757 no longer recommended? Answer: Asset allocation strategies are universally applicable. The main differences between Taiwan and the US lie in stock pledging rules and leveraged ETF choices. 00864B can be used as a cash alternative, similar to a USD fixed deposit. Reasons for no longer recommending investment in 00757 can be found in the videos from 2021 and 2022. Jason:\nQuestion: Can dollar-cost averaging (DCA) be used to invest in leveraged ETFs like Q2D? Answer: When investing in any asset, including leveraged ETFs, lump-sum purchasing should be adopted instead of DCA. Returns from DCA are likely to be lower than lump-sum purchasing. IV. Key Takeaways # QQQ index funds are like aircraft carriers, offering stability and substantial returns, while individual stock and sector investments are like sailing small boats, carrying high risk and vulnerability to market fluctuations. \u0026ndash; James \u0026amp; Eric\nChoosing long-term investment in QQQ index funds can mitigate the risks associated with individual stocks and sector investments, providing more stable returns.\nThe central bank will not disregard economic recession, as it leads to rising unemployment, a key indicator that the central bank monitors. \u0026ndash; James\nOne of the objectives of the central bank\u0026rsquo;s monetary policy is to maintain low unemployment; therefore, it will not stand idly by in the face of economic recession.\nLoss aversion is a common mistake among investors. Losses should be cut promptly, and funds should be reallocated to higher-quality assets. \u0026ndash; Cheng Ge (PC)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s crucial to overcome the psychological barrier of loss aversion in investing, decisively cutting losses to prevent them from escalating.\nThe US\u0026rsquo;s national strength rests on four pillars: government, the financial industry, businesses, and national defense. These four pillars work in synergy to achieve strategic goals. \u0026ndash; James\nAmerica\u0026rsquo;s robust, comprehensive national strength is the cornerstone of the US dollar\u0026rsquo;s strong position.\nIn the long term, policies of both US parties have a limited impact on investors; the market adjusts itself based on policies. \u0026ndash; James\nThe market has a self-regulating mechanism, enabling it to adapt to various policy environments.\nWhen investing in any asset, including leveraged ETFs, lump-sum purchasing should be adopted instead of dollar-cost averaging (DCA). Returns from DCA are likely to be lower than lump-sum purchasing. \u0026ndash; James\n\u0026ldquo;Buy whenever you have money\u0026rdquo; is the investment strategy James consistently emphasizes. DCA is less efficient for long-term investment.\nV. Summary # This session primarily revolved around investment cycles, with James explaining how to identify market cycles and emphasizing the distinction between premature and incorrect judgments, using Buffett\u0026rsquo;s actions during the 2008 financial crisis as an example. Furthermore, it provided detailed insights into the risks of real estate investment, insurance selection, stock pledging, and asset allocation strategies. In the Q\u0026amp;A segment, students raised questions and shared their perspectives on topics such as the aircraft carrier investment strategy, property tax, central bank policy, currency devaluation, and investment strategy in the Taiwanese market. James offered comprehensive answers to each question and reiterated the importance of long-term investment in QQQ index funds, along with the \u0026ldquo;buy whenever you have money\u0026rdquo; investment strategy.\nDisclaimer: This document is for personal learning and note-taking purposes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Topic # This session focuses on long-term index fund investing. The core message is: hold index funds firmly, ignore market fluctuations, maintain a proper asset allocation, and leverage the compounding effect of time to achieve financial freedom. James also warns against investment scams and emphasizes avoiding unnecessary risks, while offering advice on investing in children\u0026rsquo;s education funds.\nII. Presentation Summary # Advantages of Index Funds: Long-term index fund investing eliminates the need to follow short-term market fluctuations, international affairs, financial reports, and economic data. Focus on asset allocation and consistent investment. The Power of Compounding: James uses several examples to illustrate the magic of compounding: A monthly investment of 1000 TWD can grow to 17.3 million TWD in 40 years; a lump-sum investment of 100,000 TWD can reach 18.8 million TWD in 40 years; starting early is crucial, as a 10-year delay significantly impacts final returns; one share of QQQ at 500 USD will become 25,000 USD in 30 years and 94,000 USD in 40 years. Safe Asset Allocation: Asset allocation is more critical than any market commentary. James recommends deleveraging and reducing debt for those nearing retirement, holding a larger cash position. For younger individuals with stable income, leveraging can be considered. He suggests using a beta of 1.0 as a benchmark, reducing beta when the market is overheated, and increasing it back to 1.0 during market downturns. For cash allocation, he references Buffett and suggests a sample allocation (Scenario 3): 40% index funds, 30% 2x leveraged funds, and 30% cash. Beware of Investment Scams: Don\u0026rsquo;t trust investment information from unknown accounts or websites. Choose legitimate financial institutions. Don\u0026rsquo;t Give Money Directly to Children: James uses personal anecdotes and case studies to caution against putting assets directly in children\u0026rsquo;s names, as this may discourage their initiative or cause family conflicts. However, investing children\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;lucky money\u0026rdquo; (red envelopes) for them is recommended as an educational fund. Risks of Real Estate Investment: James reiterates his advice against early homeownership for young people, arguing that real estate is illiquid, high-risk, and ties up capital that could be used for other investments. He highlights the added risk in Taiwan, where mortgage debt remains even after foreclosure. Recommended Learning Resources: He recommends a YouTube channel called \u0026ldquo;什么值得读\u0026rdquo; (What\u0026rsquo;s Worth Reading) for valuable content on value investing. Emergency Fund: Maintain a cash reserve equivalent to six months of living expenses in a money market fund account. Investing this emergency fund in stocks is not recommended. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Jeff:\nShares: Highlights misconceptions about investing held by two listeners and emphasizes the importance of carefully studying James\u0026rsquo;s lecture notes, particularly the chart on page two. James\u0026rsquo;s response: Affirms Jeff\u0026rsquo;s points and re-emphasizes the importance of a solid investment philosophy to avoid being swayed by market noise. Cat:\nShares: A listener holding 35 million TWD in 00662 still finds the 2% withdrawal rate insufficient. Discusses the spending needs and inheritance considerations of single individuals. James\u0026rsquo;s response: Different indices have different volatility and dividend yields, requiring adjustments to withdrawal rates. For higher withdrawals, consider ETFs with higher dividend yields, such as 0056, which yields around 4-5%. H:\nQuestion: High rental costs for young people, should they buy a house? Mortgages offer tax deductions, while renting does not. Concerned about insufficient funds for leveraged investing. James\u0026rsquo;s response: Recommends watching the \u0026ldquo;30 Years of Different Destinies\u0026rdquo; video, which analyzes the pros and cons of renting versus buying. Young people should prioritize investing in index funds to build wealth through compounding and consider buying a house later. Yonglin:\nQuestion: Should money be invested in children\u0026rsquo;s names for long-term holding? Should a mortgage-free house be sold to invest in index funds after retirement? James\u0026rsquo;s response: Advises against putting money directly in children\u0026rsquo;s names. Retirees should deleverage, and selling a mortgage-free house to invest in index funds is a viable option. Mike:\nShares: Success story of investing his children\u0026rsquo;s education fund in QQQ. Gives the example of Taoyuan Language in Taiwan, suggesting potential leveraged investment through real estate mortgages. Question: How to establish a family trust and manage generational wealth like the Rockefeller family? James\u0026rsquo;s response: Recommends contacting Lisa for trust advice when assets reach a certain level and age. For now, focus on investing. Trusts can be considered around 70-80 years old. Single individuals or those without children should rely on trusts, appointing guardians and executors. Those with children can consider Trust 2.0, with the bank as executor and children as supervisors. Family foundations managed by professional institutions are also an option. Recommends the Walmart family\u0026rsquo;s living trust as a model. Becky, Jessie, and Other Participants:\nBecky: Difficulties of renting at an older age. Jessie: How to balance saving for an emergency fund, paying off a mortgage, and investing simultaneously. Other Participants: Questions about real estate investment, cash management, insurance, Bitcoin, and Japanese government bonds. James\u0026rsquo;s response: Addresses each question and reiterates his investment philosophy. For example, young people should avoid real estate and insurance due to high risks; long-term bonds and municipal bonds are not suitable for emergency funds. IV. Key Takeaways # Time is the source of all power. \u0026ndash; James\nJames uses examples like the evolution of Earth\u0026rsquo;s ecosystem and human evolution to illustrate the power of time and emphasize the importance of long-term investing.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t casually help others with money. People will resent you for it for a lifetime. \u0026ndash; James\nCautions against testing human nature with money and emphasizes setting boundaries with financial assistance.\nThe earlier you invest, the better. Keep enough emergency funds. The earlier you invest, the lower the risk. \u0026ndash; Jeff\nEmphasizes the importance of early investing and maintaining an emergency fund.\nLaugh a little; how long a scammer can scam is determined by the fool. \u0026ndash; Mike\nA cynical comment on the prevalence of scammers and a reminder to stay vigilant.\nV. Conclusion # The core message of this session remains long-term index fund investing. James uses clear language and vivid examples to reiterate the power of compounding and the importance of starting early. He also addresses audience questions on asset allocation, real estate, trusts, emergency funds, and children\u0026rsquo;s education funds, sharing advice on avoiding common investment traps and achieving financial freedom. He further recommends learning resources and provides commentary on social phenomena.\nDisclaimer: This document is for personal learning notes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Topic # During periods of market volatility, investors should prioritize risk control and maintain a positive and optimistic mindset. By establishing a rational asset allocation strategy, such as holding cash, index funds, and leveraged funds, and selecting an appropriate allocation plan based on individual circumstances, investors can effectively mitigate market risks and ensure survival even in extreme situations.\nII. Briefing Content # Investment Objective: Identify high-quality investment targets, such as market-capitalization-weighted index funds, and hold them for the long term. Avoid chasing high-return investment targets, as excessive volatility may lead to an inability to hold, ultimately hindering returns.\nRisk Control:\nDo not overestimate your risk tolerance, as market downturns often exceed expectations. Selling leads to permanent losses; the only mistake in the market is selling. Investing is a process that goes against human nature, requiring the overcoming of fear and greed. Always ensure survival in extreme market conditions, meaning possessing sufficient cash flow to sustain living expenses. Holding cash is crucial for mitigating risks. Investment Mindset:\nInvestors should remain perpetually optimistic, believing that the market will eventually rise. Be patient, as wealth accumulation takes time. Do not be swayed by short-term market fluctuations; adhere to a long-term investment strategy. Do not attempt to predict the market, and ignore market noise. Keep investing simple: buy when you have money and hold for the long term; avoid excessive trading. Asset Allocation:\nThe highest guiding principle of asset allocation is: you can still survive under extreme market conditions. Retirees need to hold more cash and can utilize leveraged funds to enhance returns while reducing risks. Employed individuals can choose different asset allocation plans based on their circumstances, but ensure a certain proportion of cash holdings. Do not alter your asset allocation based on market ups and downs, as this constitutes short-term trading behavior. Asset allocation needs to be adjusted based on individual situations. For example, when significant events like retirement or purchasing a house occur, reassessment and adjustment of the asset allocation plan are necessary. Leverage initially carries higher risk, which gradually decreases as the market rises. It is recommended that retirement accounts comprise at least 30% of total assets to effectively avoid taxes during rebalancing. Market Efficiency:\nThe market is efficient; it\u0026rsquo;s nearly impossible to find opportunities for consistent excess returns. Do not readily believe investment strategies claiming to achieve excess returns, as they are often unsustainable. The Role of Wall Street:\nWall Street\u0026rsquo;s primary roles are to provide liquidity and investment products, establish the framework for investment transactions, and lower the barriers to entry, allowing ordinary investors to participate. Investors need to understand how Wall Street operates to avoid falling into its traps. Market makers are a crucial part of Wall Street. They profit by providing bid-ask spreads while also offering liquidity to the market. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IM:\nSharing: Black swan events remind us that people are forgetful, easily becoming optimistic during market upswings and panicking during downturns. Question: How to control optimism and avoid overconfidence leading to bankruptcy? James\u0026rsquo;s response: Remember the highest guiding principle of asset allocation, ensuring survival under extreme conditions. Cash is the lifeline for survival. Sunny:\nQuestion: How to persuade people around me not to purchase insurance and financial products? James\u0026rsquo;s response: By calculating the annualized return rate of insurance products and comparing it with the return rates of other investment products, you can demonstrate that insurance and financial products offer lower returns. You can compare the return rates of insurance products with the long-term returns of index funds and point out that the income source for insurance companies and insurance agents is the premiums paid by customers. Jason:\nSharing: Experienced Apple Vision Pro and found its spatial computing capabilities impressive, but currently, it has limited functionality and applications, along with a high price tag. Question: If investing is so simple, what is the role of Wall Street experts? James\u0026rsquo;s response: Wall Street\u0026rsquo;s role primarily lies in providing liquidity, investment products, and the trading infrastructure, lowering the barriers to entry, enabling ordinary investors to participate in the market. Market makers are an essential component of Wall Street, making profits by providing bid-ask spreads while also offering liquidity to the market. Brian:\nQuestion: How can employed individuals utilize the asset allocation plan in Scenario 9? James\u0026rsquo;s response: Scenario 9 is suitable for retired individuals with loans. If you are employed and have substantial loans, such as a mortgage, you need to adjust the plan based on your circumstances. For example, pay off a portion of the loan before proceeding with asset allocation. Moreover, leverage carries higher risk initially, which gradually decreases as the market rises. Question: How to allocate and rebalance assets between a 401K account and a Roth IRA account? James\u0026rsquo;s response: It\u0026rsquo;s recommended that retirement accounts comprise at least 30% of total assets for effective tax avoidance during rebalancing. Due to the limited investment options within a 401K account, direct purchase of QQQ may not be possible. You can use similar alternatives or transfer funds to a Roth IRA account for more flexibility. Yingying:\nQuestion: What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between QQQ and QQQM? James\u0026rsquo;s response: The market is efficient. There won\u0026rsquo;t be a significant difference in the long-term returns of QQQ and QQQM. Choose QQQ, which has lower fees. Grace:\nQuestion: Should I convert 0066 to 00670L during a market downturn? James\u0026rsquo;s response: Do not change your asset allocation based on market fluctuations, as this constitutes short-term trading behavior. Using Fatality:\nJames\u0026rsquo;s response: Charles Schwab is recommended because it is both a brokerage and a bank, offering higher security. Fidelity only has brokerage services and lacks a banking license, potentially facing risks during financial crises. IV. Key Insights # The highest guiding principle of investing is: you can still survive under extreme market conditions. \u0026ndash; James\nUnder any circumstances, ensure that you have sufficient cash flow to sustain your living expenses. This is the bottom line of investing.\nWhere are Wall Street\u0026rsquo;s yachts? Where are the clients\u0026rsquo; yachts? \u0026ndash; James\nThis vividly illustrates Wall Street\u0026rsquo;s profit model, reminding investors to be wary of its various fees and traps.\nLook down upon the poor and favor the rich. \u0026ndash; Zero seven\u0026rsquo;s teacher\nThis phrase reveals the harsh reality of Wall Street in the past and reflects the inequality of investment opportunities.\nThe market is efficient; you cannot have excess profits. \u0026ndash; James\nThis emphasizes the efficient market hypothesis, reminding investors not to seek easy opportunities for excess returns.\nV. Conclusion # This episode reiterates the importance of risk control and investment mindset, providing a detailed explanation of how to allocate assets under different circumstances and how to perceive the market and the role of Wall Street. Through interactive Q\u0026amp;A with the audience, James addresses various investment-related questions and offers practical advice.\nDisclaimer: This article is for personal learning notes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Theme # This session focuses on the philosophy of long-term investing, emphasizing the importance of independent thinking and risk management. James reiterates his long-held investment philosophy: choose the right investment target (such as QQQ), buy in early and hold for the long term, ignoring short-term market fluctuations, and ultimately achieve steady wealth growth. In addition, he discusses how to maintain a positive mindset, deal with stress and anxiety that may arise during the investment process, and how to choose a reliable brokerage to ensure account security.\nII. Briefing Content # Wealth is accumulated slowly, and enjoying the process of wealth accumulation is the meaning of life. Getting rich overnight or quickly is not the best way. Slowly accumulating wealth and enjoying it allows you to experience the true meaning of life and learn and grow from it. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly pursue high returns while ignoring risks. Many people pursue quick riches and hope for super high returns, but often overlook the risks involved, which may ultimately lead to losses outweighing gains. Learn to assess risk and choose an investment strategy that matches your risk tolerance. Investing requires finding a definite eternity, ignoring market noise, and maintaining inner peace. Index fund investing is a definite and eternal strategy that does not require painstaking research and operation. Simply holding for the long term can yield considerable returns. Investment is a loser\u0026rsquo;s game, not seeking to win, but seeking not to lose. In investing, avoiding mistakes is more important than pursuing victory.

Question and James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: James believes that it is impossible to predict the market and avoid all risks completely. The important thing is to control risk exposure and avoid over-betting. If you are worried about the volatility of TQQQ, you can choose a more conservative investment strategy, such as QQQ. James also reminds everyone to distinguish between personal thinking and public advice, and not to be easily swayed by the thoughts of others.

Investment should choose targets that have been tested by time, such as QQQ or SPY.

Draft down:\nSharing: Proposed the possibility of leveraging 0% interest credit cards for investment and using the box spread strategy to increase capital utilization. Question and James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: About credit card investment: James believes that credit card limits are limited and there is a risk of not being able to renew the loan, making it unsuitable as a main source of investment funds. It is only suitable for short-term turnover of small amounts of funds. About the box spread strategy: James believes that the box spread strategy is too complex and risky and is not recommended for ordinary investors. Jason:\nQuestion and James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: How to overcome short-term pain in the investment process: James suggested lowering expectations, not pursuing perfection or getting rich quickly, finding solutions to problems, and transferring the pressure to those who can bear it, such as superiors or more experienced individuals. Think about solutions for the worst-case scenario, such as job loss or investment losses, and maintain a positive mindset, believing that the problem will eventually be solved. About non-US tax resident investing in US stocks: James believes that non-US tax residents can use their passports to open brokerage accounts in the US without a Social Security Number. It is recommended to choose large, reputable brokers, such as Charles Schwab, and avoid using online brokers, such as Webull and Robinhood, as online brokers have security risks and imperfect regulations.
