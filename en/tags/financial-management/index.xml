<p>The core concept of this book is that everyone can achieve financial freedom through investment, not just the wealthy or high-income earners. Through thirteen Investment Iron Laws, it emphasizes the importance of correct financial management concepts and long-term investment, encouraging readers to start managing their finances early, invest primarily in high-return investment tools such as stocks and real estate, and hold them for the long term, ultimately achieving financial freedom through the power of compound interest. The book uses numerous real-life examples and simple language to help readers understand and master correct financial management methods, while abandoning common financial management misunderstandings, such as short-term trading and over-reliance on bank deposits.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Personal investment can lead to wealth:</strong> The author believes that personal investment is not only a means to improve financial status but also an important path to wealth. Even if the monthly investment amount is small, as long as you persevere, you can accumulate considerable wealth by relying on the power of compound interest and ultimately realize the dream of becoming a billionaire. The book illustrates the power of compound interest with the example of investing 1200 Yuan per month with an annual return of 20%, resulting in assets exceeding 100 million Yuan after 40 years. It also cites the financial stories of the Lien Chan family and a postman to prove that even ordinary office workers can accumulate huge wealth with proper financial management.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing income and reducing expenditure treats the symptoms, not the root cause:</strong> Although diligence and frugality are traditional virtues, it is difficult to achieve financial freedom solely by relying on them in the era of rapid economic development. The author believes that financial management is more important than increasing income and reducing expenditure. The core of financial management lies in &ldquo;making money with money&rdquo; by achieving higher returns through investment, thereby enabling wealth to grow exponentially. The book uses the Lien Chan family&rsquo;s financial management methods as an example to illustrate the importance of investing in stocks and real estate. It points out that the Lien family did not start with huge wealth but accumulated astonishing wealth through long-term investment and financial management.</li>
<li><strong>Financial management methods cause the wealth gap:</strong> The author believes that the main cause of the wealth gap is not external factors such as family background, personal effort, or luck, but the difference in financial concepts and methods. The rich tend to invest their assets in high-yield investment tools such as stocks and real estate, while the poor tend to deposit money in banks, resulting in a slow rate of wealth appreciation. The book uses the example of two classmates who joined the same company after graduation to illustrate how different financial management methods eventually lead to vastly different wealth outcomes.</li>

<li><strong>Saving is equal to wasting resources:</strong> The author points out that keeping money in the bank seems safe but is actually a waste of resources. This is because bank deposit interest rates are low, and under the influence of inflation, the real rate of return is close to zero or even negative. This means that money deposited in the bank not only fails to appreciate but also depreciates. The book uses biblical stories and the example of the Nobel Prize Foundation to illustrate that not making good use of wealth, even without loss, is a waste.</li>
<li><strong>Deposit interest rates do not have compound interest benefits:</strong> Although bank deposits also enjoy compound interest, due to the low interest rate, the effect of compound interest is very limited and difficult to withstand the erosion of inflation. The author compares the final returns of two investment methods after 40 years, using a 5% bank interest rate and a 20% stock/real estate investment return rate as examples, illustrating the importance of the rate of return on investment.</li>
<li><strong>The invisible killer of currency value - inflation:</strong> Inflation is the &ldquo;invisible killer&rdquo; that causes money to depreciate. The author vividly illustrates the impact of inflation by comparing the price of red bean ice 30 years ago and now. He points out that in an inflationary environment, depositing money in the bank actually means &ldquo;the more you save, the less you have&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>The way to wealth of Zhang Pingsan, former chairman of Chang Hwa Bank:</strong> The author tells the story of Zhang Pingsan, the former chairman of Chang Hwa Bank, who achieved tremendous wealth growth by continuously borrowing money to buy Chang Hwa Bank shares and holding them for a long time. Those who sold their shares and put the money in the bank missed the opportunity to become wealthy. This once again proves the point that &ldquo;don&rsquo;t save money in the bank&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>The money deposited in the bank should not exceed living expenses:</strong> The author suggests that the amount of money deposited in the bank should be limited to meet two months of living expenses, and the excess should be used for investment to obtain higher returns. He also proposes a &ldquo;two large, one small&rdquo; investment portfolio suggestion: most assets are invested in stocks and real estate, and a small portion of funds is deposited in the bank for emergencies. He explains the liquidity of stocks and real estate to dispel readers&rsquo; concerns about investment liquidity.</li>

<li><strong>How Li Ka-shing accumulated wealth:</strong> The author uses Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong&rsquo;s richest man, as an example to illustrate the importance of long-term investment. Li Ka-shing accumulated huge wealth through long-term investment in real estate. Getting rich through financial management requires time and patience; it is impossible to achieve overnight success. His success was not solely based on luck or hard work; more importantly, it was due to his long-term vision and perseverance.</li>
<li><strong>It takes a long time to see the effect of compound interest in financial management:</strong> The manifestation of the compound interest effect takes time, and it is difficult to see significant results in short-term investments. The author uses the example of investing 14,000 Yuan annually with an annual return of 20% to calculate the investment returns after 10, 20, 30, and 40 years, which are 360,000 Yuan, 2.61 million Yuan, 16.55 million Yuan, and 102.81 million Yuan, respectively. This set of data clearly demonstrates the power of compound interest and the importance of waiting patiently. Financial management is more like a marathon than a sprint.</li>
<li><strong>As long as you are patient, the money won&rsquo;t run away:</strong> Wealth accumulation is a gradual process that requires patience to wait for the compound interest effect to play out. The author uses the land investment experience of Zhang Yaohongying, Chairman of Hongjing Construction, as an example to illustrate that even if the initial investment return is not obvious, as long as you persist in holding it for a long time, you can eventually get a rich return.</li>
<li><strong>Getting rich overnight is counterproductive:</strong> The author warns readers that getting rich through financial management takes time, and they should not dream of getting rich quickly. Investment opportunities that bring rapid wealth in the short term are often accompanied by extremely high risks, which may eventually lead to losing everything. The author suggests that if you want to get rich quickly, you should choose to start a business instead of resorting to speculation.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Procrastination is the main reason for financial failure:</strong> The author points out that procrastination is one of the main reasons for financial failure. As age increases, the time available for investment decreases, and the space for the compound interest effect to play out also shrinks. Therefore, financial management should start as early as possible. Do not wait until you are older to realize the importance of financial management, as it is often too late.</li>
<li><strong>Start investing from today:</strong> The earlier you start investing, the longer the time for compound interest, and the higher the final return. The author calculates the monthly investment amount required under the same target amount and investment rate of return with different starting investment ages as examples. The data shows that the later you start investing, the higher the monthly investment amount required, highlighting the importance of starting financial management early.</li>
<li><strong>Jeffrey Koo Jr. is good at making money:</strong> The author uses the example of Jeffrey Koo Jr., Vice President of CTBC Financial Holding, to illustrate that even those from wealthy families should learn financial management early. Jeffrey Koo Jr. invested his savings in the stock market during his university days and obtained substantial returns, indicating that young people can also achieve success through financial management.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t neglect financial management because of lack of money:</strong> The author emphasizes that financial management is not exclusive to the rich. Even if you don&rsquo;t have much money, you should start as early as possible and let the limited funds play the role of compound interest, accumulating little by little to eventually accumulate considerable wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Youth is the most appropriate time to take risks:</strong> When you are young, you have a lighter family burden and the cost of failure is relatively low, so it is more suitable to take certain investment risks. Moreover, young people have more time to make up for potential losses and learn from their mistakes.</li>

<li><strong>Good use of debt investment:</strong> The author introduces the concept of &ldquo;financial leverage,&rdquo; which refers to using borrowed funds for investment to achieve a small investment with a large return, maximizing profits. He uses the examples of Chen Youhao, President of Eastern Multimedia Group, and Weng Daming of Hualon Group to illustrate how successful entrepreneurs use financial leverage for business expansion and investment. Specific examples are used to calculate the investment return rate under different leverage ratios to help readers understand the principle and role of financial leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Two major principles of borrowing:</strong> The author proposes two major principles for debt investment: 1. The expected return on investment must be greater than the loan interest rate; 2. In the worst case, cash income must be sufficient to pay the principal and interest of the loan. These two principles emphasize the risks of debt investment and remind readers to rationally evaluate the expected rate of return of the investment target and conduct risk assessment to ensure that even if the investment fails, the principal and interest of the loan can be repaid on time.</li>
<li><strong>Banks are not places to save money:</strong> The author points out that for people who are good at financial management, banks are not places to save money but sources of borrowing. He explains the operating model of banks: Banks absorb deposits from depositors and then lend these funds to investors. Investors make profits through investment and pay interest to banks. Therefore, people who are good at financial management can use bank funds for investment to magnify returns.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid improper debt:</strong> The author cautions readers to avoid improper debt. Do not borrow money to participate in high-risk activities such as futures, margin trading, and gambling because the expected return rate of these activities is negative, and long-term participation will inevitably lead to losses. Also, do not over-engage in consumer loans, such as credit card loans and car loans, as high-interest loans will seriously erode personal wealth. Mortgage loans are acceptable, but you should also live within your means and make sure that the monthly repayment pressure is within your affordable range.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Analyze risks and reduce harm:</strong> The author points out that risks cannot be completely avoided in the investment process. The purpose of risk management is not to eliminate risk but to analyze risk and reduce the potential harm caused by risk. He emphasizes not to over-rely on forecasting because the accuracy of forecasting is difficult to guarantee, and over-reliance on forecasting may lead investors to lose their risk awareness.</li>
<li><strong>Forbes&rsquo; philosophy of distress:</strong> The author uses the example of American billionaire Forbes to illustrate that even risk-averse people can take risks through reasonable risk management. Although Forbes doesn&rsquo;t like adventure, in order to experience the beauty of life, he will participate in some high-risk activities, such as hot air ballooning and off-road motorcycles. But he will make full preparations before taking risks and take various measures to reduce risks.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t blindly avoid risks:</strong> The author believes that in a changing environment, the biggest risk is not taking risks. In order to obtain higher returns, certain risks must be taken. Blindly avoiding risks may eventually lead to missed opportunities and even failure to achieve financial freedom.</li>
<li><strong>Overcome risks - start small:</strong> For unfamiliar investments, you should start with small investments, gradually accumulate experience, and gradually improve your risk tolerance. Just like scouts, first test the waters with a small amount to understand the situation, and then gradually increase the investment.</li>
<li><strong>There is no high-return, zero-risk investment:</strong> The author reminds readers that all high-yield investments are accompanied by high risks and not to believe in the so-called &ldquo;high-yield, risk-free&rdquo; investment scams.

<ul>
<li><strong>Diversify your investments and hold them for the long term:</strong> The author proposes the investment strategy of &ldquo;diversification and long-term holding&rdquo; and believes that this is the key to avoiding being trapped and obtaining long-term stable returns. Diversified investment can reduce the risk of choosing the wrong investment target; diversifying investment timing can reduce the risk of buying at market highs; long-term holding can reduce the risk brought by short-term market fluctuations and fully enjoy the benefits brought by compound interest.</li>
<li><strong>Principle of risk diversification:</strong> The principle of diversified investment is to reduce the overall risk of the investment portfolio by increasing the types of investments so that the rise and fall of different assets in the investment portfolio can offset each other. The author points out that diversification is not the more the better and that management costs need to be considered. Too many investment types will increase management difficulty and cost, which is not conducive to improving profits.</li>
<li><strong>Diversify investment timing:</strong> In order to reduce the risk of buying at market highs, the author suggests spreading the funds over different periods. He proposes two methods: one is &ldquo;invest if you have money,&rdquo; and the other is &ldquo;regularly invest a fixed amount in mutual funds.&rdquo; &ldquo;Invest if you have money&rdquo; means that once you have idle funds, invest immediately and do not try to predict market timing; &ldquo;regular investment of a fixed amount in mutual funds&rdquo; means investing a fixed amount every month to buy mutual funds. This method can effectively smooth market fluctuations and reduce investment risks.</li>
<li><strong>Methods of diversified investment:</strong> The author introduces three methods of diversified investment in detail: 1. Diversification of investment tools, such as stocks, real estate, gold, art, etc.; 2. Diversification of investment targets, for example, when investing in stocks, do not just buy one stock, but buy multiple stocks in different industries; 3. Diversification of investment regions, for example, invest some assets in overseas markets to diversify regional risks.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce the risk of choosing the wrong selling time - long-term holding:</strong> Through research on the Taiwan stock market, the author found that the longer the holding time, the lower the probability of loss. For example, the probability of loss when holding stocks for more than 5 years is only 1%, and it is almost impossible to lose money when holding for more than 10 years. This once again proves the importance of long-term holding.</li>

<li><strong>Liu Qiude&rsquo;s secret to wealth:</strong> The author uses the financial story of Liu Qiude, Vice President of Cathay Life Insurance, as an example to illustrate the power of long-term holding of high-quality stocks. Liu Qiude worked at Cathay Life Insurance from his twenties. He held his savings and the Cathay Life Insurance shares he acquired from his colleagues for a long time and eventually became a billionaire. This example also reflects the long-term and stable performance growth of Cathay Life Insurance from the side.</li>
<li><strong>Why stocks have high returns:</strong> The author explains the source of returns from stock investment: stocks represent ownership of a company, and shareholders can share in the company&rsquo;s profits and asset appreciation. Therefore, the returns from investing in stocks come from corporate earnings and asset appreciation, not from the losses of other investors. He pointed out that the long-term rise in stock prices is mainly due to the improvement of corporate profitability and the growth of asset value.</li>
<li><strong>Carefully select the types of stocks to invest in:</strong> The author compares the characteristics of listed stocks, over-the-counter stocks, unlisted stocks, and mutual funds and suggests that ordinary investors should give priority to investing in listed stocks or mutual funds. Listed stocks have good liquidity, transparent information disclosure, and relatively strict supervision, so the risks are relatively low. Mutual funds are managed by professionals and can effectively diversify investment risks, making them suitable for investors who do not have much time and energy to research stocks.</li>
<li><strong>Stock investment is better than real estate investment:</strong> The author compares stock and real estate investment from the aspects of investment threshold, taxation, and trading convenience. He believes that stock investment has a lower threshold, lighter taxes, and is more convenient to trade, making it more suitable for ordinary investors.</li>
<li><strong>Can stocks still maintain high returns in the future?:</strong> The author analyzes and forecasts the future return rate of the Taiwan stock market. He believes that although Taiwan&rsquo;s economic growth has slowed down, it is still higher than other countries and regions, so the Taiwan stock market still has high investment value in the future, but the return rate may be slightly lower than in the past.</li>

<li><strong>Buy casually, buy at any time, don&rsquo;t sell:</strong> The author once again emphasizes the investment strategy of &ldquo;buy casually, buy at any time, don&rsquo;t sell&rdquo; and points out that this is the highest level of financial management. This strategy seems simple, but it actually contains profound investment wisdom: it emphasizes long-term holding, infrequent trading, and avoiding being affected by short-term market fluctuations, thereby obtaining long-term and stable returns. The author admits that most people find it difficult to do this because they cannot overcome human weaknesses such as greed and fear.</li>
<li><strong>What to buy - buy casually:</strong> The author points out that as long as diversified investment is achieved, the selection of individual stocks is not important. He uses the experiment of &ldquo;monkeys throwing darts to select stocks&rdquo; and his own experience of selecting stocks with his children as examples to illustrate the effectiveness of &ldquo;buying casually&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>When to buy - buy at any time:</strong> The author suggests that investors &ldquo;buy if they have money&rdquo;, and do not try to predict market timing. He emphasizes &ldquo;buying and waiting for a chance to rise&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;waiting for a chance to buy&rdquo;. Because the market is difficult to predict, and time is the key factor in compound interest, the earlier you start investing, the more you can enjoy the benefits brought by compound interest.</li>
<li><strong>When to sell - don&rsquo;t sell:</strong> The author believes that long-term holding is the key to obtaining high returns. He quotes Jesse Livermore, the author of Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, and the investment strategy of Taiwan&rsquo;s richest man, Cai Wanlin, to illustrate the importance of long-term holding.</li>
<li><strong>Random walk and efficient market theory:</strong> The author introduces the &ldquo;random walk hypothesis&rdquo; and the &ldquo;efficient market hypothesis&rdquo; to provide a theoretical basis for the strategy of &ldquo;buy casually, buy at any time, don&rsquo;t sell&rdquo;. The &ldquo;random walk hypothesis&rdquo; believes that short-term fluctuations in stock prices are random and difficult to predict; the &ldquo;efficient market hypothesis&rdquo; believes that all information in the market is already reflected in stock prices, so it is futile to predict market trends by analyzing information.</li>

Technical analysis is based on historical data, but the market environment is constantly changing, and past performance does not represent future trends.</li>

Instead of trying to predict the market, it is better to formulate a reasonable investment strategy and hold it for a long time. The author illustrates the unreliability of prediction with an example of a failed stock market prophet.</li>
<li><strong>Believe in yourself rather than experts:</strong> The author advises investors not to over-rely on expert opinions and to cultivate their own financial management capabilities and independent judgment. He pointed out that expert opinions often contradict each other, and ten experts may have eleven opinions. Besides, experts may also be influenced by various factors, such as conflicts of interest, and thus give biased opinions.</li>

<li><strong>Value strategy:</strong> The core of value strategy is &ldquo;buy when the value is higher than the price, and sell when the value is lower than the price&rdquo;. The author uses the huge difference in the share price of China Development Financial at different times as an example to illustrate the impact of market sentiment on stock prices and the performance of investors&rsquo; irrational behavior. He advises investors to learn rational consumption behavior and buy stocks when the &ldquo;price is discounted&rdquo;. He also points out that the key to value investing is being able to accurately assess the intrinsic value of a company, which requires certain professional knowledge and experience.</li>
<li><strong>Growth strategy:</strong> The core of the growth strategy is to invest in companies with high growth potential in the future and hold them for the long term. The author uses Peter Lynch&rsquo;s investment strategy and the investment story of the &ldquo;Coca-Cola Grandma&rdquo; as examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the growth strategy. He advises investors to choose companies with high growth potential in the next 5-10 years and focus on choosing the right industry because the growth of the industry will drive the growth of corporate performance.</li>
<li><strong>Contrarian strategy:</strong> The core of the contrarian strategy is &ldquo;invest when most people are not investing, and sell when most people are eager to invest&rdquo;. The author uses the business philosophy of Fan Li and the investment strategy of Zheng Zhoumin as examples to illustrate the principle of contrarian operation. He pointed out that market sentiment is often wrong. When the market is excessively pessimistic, it is often a good time to buy; when the market is excessively optimistic, it is often a good time to sell. However, contrarian operation is very difficult, and it requires investors to have independent thinking ability and strong psychological quality.</li>

For ordinary investors, the strategy of &ldquo;buy casually, buy at any time, don&rsquo;t sell&rdquo; is simpler and easier to implement, and it is also easier to obtain long-term and stable returns.</li>

<li><strong>Buy low and sell high is full of crises:</strong> The author pointed out that &ldquo;buying low and selling high&rdquo; seems to be the secret to making money from stock investment, but it is actually full of traps. Because no one can accurately predict the short-term fluctuations of the market, trying to make profits through &ldquo;buying low and selling high&rdquo; will often fall into the dilemma of chasing ups and downs, which will eventually lead to losses. He emphasizes that the main source of stock investment income is corporate profits and dividends, not the difference in buying and selling prices.</li>
<li><strong>Short-term operation is gambling:</strong> The author believes that the essence of short-term operation is speculation and gambling, and it is difficult to make a profit in the long run. Because short-term operations require frequent trading, and each transaction will generate transaction costs, such as commissions, stamp duty, etc. These transaction costs will eat away at investment income, and accumulate over time, will have a significant negative impact on investment returns.</li>
<li><strong>A game with no chance of winning:</strong> The author analyzes the composition of the stock market, including intermediaries (securities companies, governments, etc.), major shareholders, major players, and retail investors. He pointed out that retail investors are at a clear disadvantage in this game of short-term operations because they lack the advantages of capital, information, and resources. Therefore, retail investors should avoid participating in short-term operations and adopt a long-term investment strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Never participate in futures and margin trading:</strong> The author strongly recommends that investors not participate in futures and margin trading because these transactions are extremely risky, and the leverage effect will magnify both profits and losses.

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t keep your money in the bank.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This doesn&rsquo;t literally mean not keeping any money in the bank, but emphasizes not leaving most assets in low-yield bank deposits long-term.  Invest in higher-yielding tools like stocks and real estate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Accumulating wealth isn&rsquo;t about cutting expenses,<br>
but about the compounding power of money making money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Albert Einstein, considered one of history&rsquo;s greatest scientists, was once asked, &ldquo;What is the most powerful force in the world?&rdquo; His answer wasn&rsquo;t the force of colliding planets or the power of a nuclear explosion, but &ldquo;compound interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the previous examples demonstrate, the factor that allows a yearly saving of 14,000 yuan to grow to over 100 million yuan in 40 years is &ldquo;compound interest.&rdquo; Since compound interest is the primary driver of accelerated wealth growth, understanding it is crucial for achieving financial success.</p>
<p>Imagine two job offers: one with a monthly salary of 100,000 yuan, and another starting at 1 yuan in the first month, doubling each subsequent month.  Assuming both jobs last two years (24 months), which would you choose?</p>
<p>At first glance, the first offer seems better.  100,000 yuan monthly yields 2.4 million yuan over 24 months. However, anyone understanding compound interest would choose the second job, which yields over 16.77 million yuan after 24 months! This is the effect of compounding. While this is an extreme example, such high growth rates are unlikely in reality.  Nevertheless, it clearly demonstrates the power of compound interest.</p>
<p>Most people have a basic understanding of compound interest.  Depositing money in a bank generates interest over time, a common understanding in modern society. Since Einstein considered compound interest the most powerful force, and it can help us become millionaires with modest investments, a deeper understanding of its workings is essential, especially for those interested in financial management.</p>
<p>Simply put, compound interest is &ldquo;interest on interest.&rdquo; We know bank deposits earn interest, calculated using compound interest. For instance, with a 10% interest rate, a 1,000 yuan deposit earns 100 yuan in interest in the first year, resulting in 1,100 yuan.  If left in the bank, the second year&rsquo;s interest is 110 yuan (on 1,100 yuan), totaling 1,210 yuan. The third year yields 121 yuan in interest, reaching 1,331 yuan.</p>
<p>Notice the increasing interest earned each year.  This is because the first year&rsquo;s interest earns interest in the second year, and so on, leading to an ever-increasing return.  This &ldquo;interest on interest&rdquo; phenomenon is compound interest.</p>
<p>The table below shows that after the 26th year, the annual interest earned surpasses the principal, and by the 40th year, the interest of 4,114 yuan is more than four times the initial 1,000 yuan principal.</p>

<p>Compound interest&rsquo;s effect varies with different interest rates and durations.  These variations are presented in compound interest tables (refer to this appendix).  These tables, composed of interest rates, years, and future value factors (the growth multiplier calculated by the formula), might seem daunting with their numerous figures. However, understanding them is invaluable for investment and financial management.  Renowned American financial advisor Venita VanCaspel calls the compound interest table the &ldquo;eighth wonder of the world.&rdquo; If you don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to travel the world, studying this table can be just as rewarding.  Understanding the characteristics of compound interest is key to leveraging its power for wealth creation.</p>
<p>The compound interest table reveals that the values increase with time and interest rate.  However, this isn&rsquo;t the whole story.  Observing compound interest graphs derived from these tables reveals further insights. Figure 1-1 assumes a yearly deposit of 1 yuan at different interest rates, plotting asset growth over 10 years. Figure 1-2 uses the same assumptions but extends the time horizon to 40 years.</p>

<p>Figure 1-2: Future Value Growth of 1 Yuan Annuity at Different Interest Rates over 40 Years</p>
<p>These graphs illustrate the growth of 1 yuan over time at various interest rates and durations. Comparing them reveals two key characteristics of compound interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As the duration (time) increases, the future value rises continuously, and the rate of increase accelerates. This is known as exponential growth.  Given sufficient time, the growth becomes dramatic, with the curve eventually approaching a straight upward line.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Different interest rates result in significantly different growth curves.  Over decades, the disparity between high and low interest rate curves becomes immense.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the secret to accumulating significant wealth from small beginnings lies in leveraging the &ldquo;money making money&rdquo; power of compound interest.  Compounding has two key features: its effect is more pronounced over longer periods, and higher returns amplify its impact. Applying these principles to investing leads to two conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Invest in high-return assets like stocks and real estate. Higher returns maximize the effect of compounding, while low returns yield minimal benefits.  To fully harness the power of compound interest, capital must be invested in high-return assets.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Hold investments long-term.  The longer the investment horizon, the more significant the compounding effect.  Short-term investments don&rsquo;t allow sufficient time for compounding to work its magic.  Therefore, long-term holdings in high-return assets are crucial for maximizing the benefits of compound interest.</li>
</ol>

<p>Everyone&rsquo;s age, personality, and applicable tax rates differ.  Therefore, each individual needs a tailored approach to wealth accumulation. I can&rsquo;t provide personalized financial planning advice based on your specific circumstances, nor can I encompass everyone&rsquo;s financial situation and plans with a few generic examples.</p>
<p>To help you design your own &ldquo;Blueprint for Financial Success,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve combined the future value and annuity future value formulas from finance to create a universal &ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula.&rdquo;  This formula empowers readers to plan their lifelong financial strategies based on their unique circumstances and objectives.</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mtable displaystyle="true" columnalign="right center left" columnspacing="0 thickmathspace" rowspacing="3pt"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Future Wealth</mtext></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>Current Wealth</mtext><mo>√ó</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>R</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mi>n</mi></msup><mo>+</mo><mtext>Annual Savings</mtext><mo>√ó</mo><mfrac><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>R</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mi>n</mi></msup><mo>‚àí</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>R</mi></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>Current Wealth</mtext><mo>√ó</mo><mtext>Future Value Factor</mtext><mo>+</mo><mtext>Annual Savings</mtext><mo>√ó</mo><mtext>Annuity Future Value Factor</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>Where:</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mi>n</mi></mtd><mtd><mo>:</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>Number of years</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mi>R</mi></mtd><mtd><mo>:</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>Average annual investment rate of return</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></p>
<p>The values for the complex calculations in the formula above (Future Value Factor and Annuity Future Value Factor) can be found in Appendix 1 of this book.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Future Value Factor:</strong> The future value of 1 yuan today, after N years, at an interest rate (or rate of return) of R%.</li>
<li><strong>Annuity Future Value Factor:</strong> The future value of an annuity of 1 yuan deposited at the end of each year, after N years, at an interest rate (or rate of return) of R%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using this formula, you can project your future wealth by inputting your current assets, average annual savings for investment, planned investment period, and expected annual rate of return. You can calculate the result or look it up in a table.</p>
<p>This formula simplifies the real-world situation, as investment returns are unlikely to remain constant each year, and annual savings might fluctuate.  However, using the &ldquo;average&rdquo; annual rate of return and &ldquo;average&rdquo; annual investment amount generally provides a reasonable approximation of future wealth.</p>
<p>The purpose of the &ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t to predict future wealth precisely but to illustrate how investment builds wealth and how financial management leads to prosperity. It aims to bolster your confidence in financial planning, enabling you to focus on key principles, maintain perseverance, and steadily progress towards your financial goals throughout market fluctuations.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a foolproof formula for riches. Following this method may lead to becoming a millionaire, but success isn&rsquo;t guaranteed.  However, inaction guarantees zero chance of success. The most valuable aspect of this wealth-building concept is the message: &ldquo;Investment and financial management can lead to wealth.&rdquo; This knowledge fosters optimism and hope. Regardless of your current wealth, age, annual savings, or investment skills, with dedication, determination, and a willingness to learn, you can leverage investing to grow your wealth.</p>
<p>After understanding this formula, follow these steps for financial planning:</p>
<p><strong>I. Data Collection:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What is your current total asset value? (Include bank deposits, stocks, real estate, etc.)</li>
<li>How much do you anticipate saving annually for investment?</li>
<li>What is your expected average annual investment rate of return?</li>
<li>How many years do you plan to invest before reaching your financial goal?</li>
<li>What is your future wealth target?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>II. Calculation and Analysis:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Use the five data points above with the &ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula&rdquo; to assess the feasibility of your wealth plan. If it&rsquo;s not feasible, how will you adjust? Will you increase savings? Improve investment skills to boost returns? Lower your wealth target? Or extend your time horizon? Adjust the variables and recalculate until you find a realistic and achievable plan.</li>
<li>Calculate your projected accumulated wealth based on your current assets, investment period, annual savings, and expected rate of return.</li>
<li>You can also use any four of the five variables (current wealth, target year, annual savings, rate of return, wealth target) to calculate the remaining variable. (Calculating the target year or rate of return using the other four variables requires a financial calculator or trial and error to find an approximate value.)</li>
</ol>
<p>While the &ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula&rdquo; involves a seemingly complex mathematical formula, its primary purpose is to explain the principles of wealth building, not to complicate financial management or confuse readers. If you don&rsquo;t have a calculator or prefer not to delve into the formula&rsquo;s calculations, feel free to disregard it.</p>
<p>Using the &ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula&rdquo; can help you plan your future finances and boost your confidence in financial management. However, it doesn&rsquo;t guarantee investment success.  Pre-planning is just the beginning; the key lies in mastering investment principles and consistent action. When starting your financial journey, clarify your financial situation, set realistic wealth goals, then use the &ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula&rdquo; to evaluate your investment strategy and timeline. Remember, the path to wealth is in your hands.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Zhang San is 30 years old with 200,000 yuan in savings. After reading this book, he resolves to become a millionaire (meaning having 100 million yuan).  He plans to invest 100,000 yuan annually in stocks and real estate with an expected 20% annual return, aiming to reach his goal by age 50.  Let&rsquo;s use the &ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula&rdquo; to assess the feasibility.</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mtable displaystyle="true" columnalign="right center left" columnspacing="0 thickmathspace" rowspacing="3pt"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Future Wealth</mtext></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>200,000</mn><mo>√ó</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>20</mn></mrow></msup><mo>+</mo><mn>100,000</mn><mo>√ó</mo><mfrac><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>20</mn></mrow></msup><mo>‚àí</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></mrow></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>200,000</mn><mo>√ó</mo><mn>38.338</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>100,000</mn><mo>√ó</mo><mn>228.98</mn><mspace width="1em"></mspace><mtext>(Corrected Annuity Factor)</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>30,435,600</mn><mspace width="1em"></mspace><mtext>(Corrected Calculation)</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></p>
<p>Based on the calculation, Zhang San&rsquo;s 200,000 yuan initial investment, along with 100,000 yuan annual investments over 20 years at a 20% average return, will yield approximately 26 million yuan, less than one-third of his 100 million yuan goal.  To become a millionaire, he can improve his return, increase his annual investment, or extend his time horizon.  A 20% return is already quite good and realistic, even for seasoned investors.  Increasing his returns further might be challenging.  Since he doesn&rsquo;t want to extend the timeline, he decides to increase his annual investment. Through frugality and a part-time job, he manages to save 200,000 yuan annually. Let&rsquo;s recalculate his future wealth after 20 years.</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mtable displaystyle="true" columnalign="right center left" columnspacing="0 thickmathspace" rowspacing="3pt"><mtr><mtd><mrow><mo>Future Wealth</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>200000</mn><mo>√ó</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>20</mn></mrow></msup><mo>+</mo><mn>200000</mn><mo>√ó</mo><mfrac><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>20</mn></mrow></msup><mrow><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>‚àí</mo><mn>1</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>200000</mn><mo>√ó</mo><mn>38.338</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>200000</mn><mo>√ó</mo><mn>186.96</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>45005600</mn></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></p>
<p>Even with doubled annual savings, his wealth after 20 years still falls short of half his goal.  With both his 20% return and 200,000 yuan annual investment maxed out, he has to extend his timeline. He decides to aim for 25 years.  Let&rsquo;s calculate his projected wealth then.</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mtable displaystyle="true" columnalign="right center left" columnspacing="0 thickmathspace" rowspacing="3pt"><mtr><mtd><mrow><mo>Future Wealth</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>200000</mn><mo>√ó</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>25</mn></mrow></msup><mo>+</mo><mn>200000</mn><mo>√ó</mo><mfrac><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>25</mn></mrow></msup><mrow><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>‚àí</mo><mn>1</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>200000</mn><mo>√ó</mo><mn>95.396</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>200000</mn><mo>√ó</mo><mn>471.98</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>113475200</mn></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></p>
<p>He finally achieves his goal of becoming a millionaire after 25 years.  Extending the timeline by just five years makes a significant difference. With a longer time horizon, his required annual investment could be even lower. This example validates the book&rsquo;s emphasis on &ldquo;youth being an asset in wealth building&rdquo; and &ldquo;the importance of long-term investing for realizing the power of compound interest.&rdquo;  Experiment with different variables to understand their impact.  <strong>You&rsquo;ll discover that the initial wealth and annual investment amount have a relatively small impact, while time and rate of return are the key drivers of wealth accumulation.</strong></p>
<p>Your circumstances might be better or worse than Zhang San&rsquo;s. Regardless, everyone has different starting points, but anyone can become a millionaire.  Calculate your own path to becoming a millionaire based on your current situation. Remember, with a modest initial investment, allocation to high-return assets like stocks and real estate, and long-term holding, becoming a millionaire is absolutely achievable.</p>
<p>Now, set your financial goal. Write down your target wealth, your desired timeline, and how you plan to use your wealth to achieve your broader life goals.</p>
<p><strong>Remember: &ldquo;Money is a means to an end, not the end itself.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Accumulating more money isn&rsquo;t always better, and having more financial goals isn&rsquo;t necessarily advantageous.  Such an approach may prevent you from ever reaching your goals and trap you in a cycle of dissatisfaction and greed. You could become a slave to money and potentially harm future generations with excessive wealth, contributing nothing to yourself, your loved ones, or society.</p>
<p>Once you have a financial goal, use the &ldquo;Wealth Formula&rdquo; to calculate your path, including required annual savings and average rate of return. This will inform your investment strategy and timeline. More importantly, determine how you will utilize your wealth once you achieve your goal.  This concretizes your aspirations. You&rsquo;ll discover that by applying the principles in this book and remaining consistent, becoming a millionaire is within reach. A clear goal leads to a happier life, and a positive attitude contributes to success in all areas of life.</p>

It points out that all high-return investments come with high risks, and while risk aversion is human nature, excessive risk aversion can lead to missed opportunities. Using Forbes&amp;#39; philosophy on risk as an example, the author illustrates how to assess risks and rewards, advocating for calculated risks with adequate preparation. The article also cautions readers against being seduced by high-risk, low-return speculative activities, encouraging them to start with small investments to gain experience, gradually overcome their fear of risk, and ultimately master risk to achieve wealth growth.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>In 1987, while working at Merrill Lynch in the United States, I met a seasoned investment veteran with decades of Wall Street experience. He once said, &ldquo;I can teach you how to pick stocks in an hour, but it would take me more than five years to teach you how to manage investment risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Risk is Unavoidable</strong></p>
<p>In the ever-changing and unpredictable world of investment, uncertainties abound. We call these uncertainties risks. How you face these risks when they materialize is a question every investor must confront. <strong>Risk is called risk precisely because future outcomes are uncertain and unavoidable.</strong> Therefore, investment and financial management should never solely focus on returns while ignoring risks. In fact, managing risk is even more crucial. <strong>The purpose of risk management is not to eliminate risk entirely, but to acknowledge its inherent existence and impossibility of complete eradication.  It&rsquo;s about analyzing risk and subsequently mitigating it.</strong></p>
<p>While engaging in risk management, investors must understand that &ldquo;you can never be fully prepared for every risk.&rdquo;  You can strive to reduce risk, but don&rsquo;t attempt to eliminate it completely. Many try to avoid risk through predictions or expert advice.  However, no matter how accurate your forecasting techniques or how insightful the expert predictions, risk can never be fully avoided. <strong>The greatest danger of predictions is not their frequent inaccuracy, but the tendency for investors to blindly trust them, losing their risk awareness. They focus solely on whether the prediction comes true, neglecting the potential magnitude of the underlying risks.</strong>  Relying solely on predictions without thorough risk analysis is extremely dangerous. Any sound investment decision inherently involves unknowns, uncertainties, and risks.  Furthermore, investments without uncertainties and a degree of risk are unlikely to be good investments.</p>
<p><strong>All High-Return Investments Carry High Risks</strong></p>
<p>The key to successful investment and financial management lies in learning to grasp high returns while effectively managing the accompanying risks.</p>
<p>The investment environment is constantly changing and unpredictable. The only constant is change. Some external factors (such as interest rates, exchange rates, economic conditions, and inflation rates) are bound to change, although the nature of these changes remains unknown.  Additionally, unforeseen events (such as wars, political events, and natural disasters) are uncontrollable variables.  To succeed in this volatile investment world, the most important thing is not to lament change but to accept it as inevitable. <strong>Prepare for various changes and even anticipate them, because only through change can wealth be redistributed.</strong> Change is both a threat and an opportunity, depending on how you respond.  Skilled investors often find profitable opportunities amidst change.</p>
<p>People often assume investors love risk.  This is not true.  Successful investors possess a unique ability to manage risk. They don&rsquo;t see &ldquo;risk-taking&rdquo; as a source of amusement, nor do they find the act of taking risks thrilling or exciting. They take risks solely for the potential of high investment returns.  Since all high-return investments inherently carry high risks, risk-taking is an unavoidable part of the journey to financial success.</p>
<p>Many perceive stock investment as extremely risky, believing stock investors to be risk-seekers. In reality, investing in stocks is not about loving the risk associated with stocks. It&rsquo;s about understanding that all high-return investments carry high risks. To build wealth, you must take the risk of investing in high-return assets and bear the associated risks.  Savvy investors understand how to take calculated risks and mitigate them.  In fact, if risk mitigation measures are implemented effectively, the actual risks of investment and financial management are relatively small.</p>
<p><strong>Stocks and real estate offer high returns precisely because of their inherent volatility and risk.</strong> Because most people are risk-averse and avoid investing in risky assets like stocks and real estate, those who can tolerate risk are better positioned to reap higher returns.</p>
<p>Many shy away from stocks and real estate primarily because they fear losses, are intimidated by future uncertainties, or can&rsquo;t handle price fluctuations. <strong>In fact, short-term price fluctuations are perfectly normal and highlight the high-risk nature of high-return investments.</strong> Therefore, to achieve high returns, one must possess a spirit of adventure and be able to withstand significant volatility.</p>
<p><em>1. Unpredictable risks allow risk-takers to earn a risk premium.</em></p>
<p><em>2. We miss opportunities because we are afraid to take risks, not because the world doesn&rsquo;t offer them.</em></p>
<p><em>3. To achieve financial success through investment, you must take risks, because high returns always come with high risks.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I dislike taking unnecessary risks, so before every activity, I do my best to take necessary precautions to mitigate risk.</p>

<p>Malcolm Forbes was a legendary figure in the American business world.  He amassed a fortune by founding Forbes magazine, possessed a priceless collection, and was listed among the 400 wealthiest Americans. He not only ran a high-risk magazine business but was also a renowned hot air balloonist and motorcycle enthusiast.  He once rode a motorcycle across Eurasia from Paris to Beijing.  He traveled the world, flying hot air balloons across the United States, and even ventured to Turkey and China, setting multiple world records and attracting widespread media attention, making him a household name.</p>
<p><strong>Averting Danger Before it Happens, Ensuring Safety</strong></p>
<p>Some labeled him an &ldquo;adventurer.&rdquo;  He offered an insightful explanation of this label, saying, &ldquo;Many people think I&rsquo;m a risk-lover.  I&rsquo;m not. Like most people, I strongly dislike risk. The reason I take risks today, despite my aversion to them, is simple: all good things in life come with risks. I take risks purely to live a rich and fulfilling life.‚Äù  &ldquo;Riding in a hot air balloon or on a motorcycle across different lands broadens one&rsquo;s horizons and exposes one to the world&rsquo;s beauty, enriching life. However, many people, despite yearning for these experiences, hesitate to engage in them because they perceive them as high-risk activities. But, once you actually try them, you&rsquo;ll find that if you take adequate precautions beforehand, the risks involved are quite small.‚Äù &ldquo;I dislike taking unnecessary risks, so before every activity, I strive to take the necessary preventative measures to mitigate risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm Forbes was risk-averse, but he took risks to experience the good things in life, and after taking those risks, he sought ways to mitigate them.</p>
<p><strong>Assess the Rewards and Risks, If It&rsquo;s Worth It ‚Äì Take the Risk</strong></p>
<p>Are you afraid of taking risks? If so, you are not alone.  Most people are afraid of taking risks; very few are natural risk-takers.  But why are some people so composed in the face of risk, and even achieve success through it?  It&rsquo;s because they understand the principles of &ldquo;nothing ventured, nothing gained&rdquo; and &ldquo;no high risk, no high return.&rdquo;  Indeed, the correct perspective on risk should be: take risks worth taking, and then find ways to mitigate them.</p>
<p>Successful investors are driven by the pursuit of &ldquo;wealth.&rdquo; Although they must be prepared to withstand the pressure of price fluctuations, as long as the expected return is high and there&rsquo;s a risk premium, risk-taking will ultimately lead to success.</p>
<p>Before every investment, it&rsquo;s essential to understand the potential risks and develop contingency plans for every possible scenario. Analyze the degree of blind risk-taking, estimate the probability of success, and continuously re-evaluate throughout the process. I recommend investors create a risk-reward assessment table before making any investment, weighing all factors.  Ask yourself, &ldquo;Can I bear the consequences if the worst-case scenario unfolds?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is the potential return of this investment attractive enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Always plan for the worst and prepare for the best. This is especially true for investment and financial management.  <strong>Before making any investment, no matter how confident you are, you should ask yourself, &ldquo;What is the worst possible outcome?&rdquo; Then ask, &ldquo;Can I bear the consequences if the worst happens?&rdquo; If the answer to both questions is yes, and the expected return is high enough, then you should invest. If the worst-case scenario is unbearable, then no matter how alluring the potential reward, you should categorically refuse to invest.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t Take Unnecessary Risks</strong></p>
<p>If you ever visit Las Vegas or Atlantic City, observe the lavishly decorated casinos carefully. You&rsquo;ll notice the absence of clocks and windows, and the ever-present bright lights.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time in the mountains, and no time in casinos.&rdquo; Why are there no clocks or windows in casinos?  It&rsquo;s because casinos leverage the law of large numbers to win your money.  The lack of clocks and windows is designed to blur the lines between day and night, encouraging gamblers to play endlessly until they lose track of time. The longer you play, the more times you play, the higher the probability of the casino winning.  As the number of games increases, the expected value gradually reveals itself.  Gambling inevitably leads to losses because its expected value is negative.  This might not be apparent in a few instances, but over time, the expected value becomes increasingly evident. Therefore, prolonged gambling inevitably leads to losses.  This explains the saying &ldquo;nine out of ten gamblers lose&rdquo; and &ldquo;long-term gambling leads to certain loss,&rdquo; which aligns perfectly with the principle of the law of large numbers. The law of large numbers states that the more times a game is played, the closer the return gets to the expected value of that game.</p>
<p>I had a classmate in the doctoral program at UC Berkeley who excelled in mathematics and frequented Las Vegas casinos on weekends.  Curious, I asked him, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so smart and you know that gambling is designed against the players. Are you trying to win money?&rdquo;  He replied, &ldquo;I never go there to win money. I gamble to relieve stress.&rdquo;  He explained that after a heartbreak in college, he tried various methods to cope, such as drinking, speeding, and traveling, but none were effective.  He eventually found that only gambling could allow him to truly escape. Gambling can be a form of entertainment, but it&rsquo;s certainly not a way to make money. Its expected average return is lower than bank deposits, making it impossible to build wealth through such activities.</p>
<p>Many people hold the misconception that &ldquo;high risk always equates to high return.&rdquo; This misunderstanding stems from a misinterpretation of the definition of &ldquo;return.&rdquo; High risk might indeed offer high potential returns, but this represents the maximum possible return, which has a very low probability.  However, in the context of &ldquo;high risk, high return,&rdquo; the &ldquo;return&rdquo; refers to the expected return (long-term average return), not the maximum possible return.  Indeed, gambling boasts incredibly high maximum potential returns, but its average, or expected, return is negative. Taking such risks is not only unprofitable but also detrimental.</p>
<p><strong>There are No High-Return, Zero-Risk Investments</strong></p>
<p>Success requires risk-taking, but risk-taking doesn&rsquo;t guarantee success.  One must take calculated risks. A calculated risk is one that, on average, offers high returns over the long term.</p>
<p>Some people&rsquo;s problem isn&rsquo;t a lack of risk-taking spirit but a tendency to take unnecessary risks. They don&rsquo;t know what risks to take to achieve financial success. As detailed in previous chapters, the cornerstone of investment success is the power of compounding, which only works effectively with high returns.  Over the long term, stocks and real estate are asset classes that offer high expected returns.  Therefore, taking calculated risks means investing in assets with high expected returns and bravely bearing the associated risks.</p>
<p>Consider a game where participants must pay $100. There&rsquo;s a 99.9% chance of losing $100 and a 0.1% chance of winning $95,000. Would you play?  In a survey I conducted with hundreds of students, over 65% chose to play this high-risk game.  Their reasoning was simple: while the risk was high, the potential loss was capped at $100, while the potential gain was a whopping $95,000.  However, the expected return of this game is negative.  Even if you get lucky and win once, in the long run, you&rsquo;re bound to lose.  This is a classic example of a risk not worth taking.</p>
<p>Avoid risks that don&rsquo;t offer high returns. Activities like futures trading, margin trading in foreign exchange and bonds, lotteries, and short-term stock trading all carry high risks and often have negative returns.  In other words, these are high-risk, negative-return activities.  You can engage in these activities for entertainment, but never delude yourself into believing they will bring you wealth.</p>
<p><strong>There are no high-return, zero-risk investment opportunities.</strong> In a society filled with intelligent individuals, such opportunities are impossible. If someone offers you a high-return, risk-free investment opportunity, they are undoubtedly trying to scam you.</p>
<p>I remind readers again: don&rsquo;t blindly chase high returns and jump into risky ventures.  Speculative activities like those mentioned above are not truly high-return investment tools, but they are definitely high-risk endeavors.  These risks are not worth taking.</p>

<p>Absolute safety is a myth. The real danger is not taking any risks. In a volatile environment, the biggest risk is not taking any risks.</p>

<p>The future world is changing rapidly.  Changes will accelerate across all aspects of business, economics, finance, politics, and society, creating a more complex financial landscape.  <strong>It&rsquo;s foreseeable that wealth redistribution will also accelerate.</strong> Risk aversion is human nature.  In the past, you could live a stable life without taking risks.  However, <strong>in the face of the volatile investment environment of the future, not taking risks becomes the biggest risk of all.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fear of Falling Will Keep You from Running Fast</strong></p>
<p>Fear of risk prevents many from investing, causing them to miss out on the opportunity to build wealth.  Keeping money in a bank seems safe and risk-free. However, as previously analyzed, inflation severely erodes the real value of money.  From a financial management perspective, keeping money in a bank carries the greatest risk.  Decades later, when those around you who invested wisely become millionaires, those who kept their money in banks may face financial hardship.  My point is: don&rsquo;t shy away from risk entirely. Risk isn&rsquo;t as terrifying as it seems.  Taking calculated risks with high potential returns is absolutely worthwhile.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often asked, &ldquo;Teacher, will the stock market fall again?&rdquo; My answer is, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;  Then they ask, &ldquo;When will it start rising?&rdquo; My answer remains, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;  They further inquire, &ldquo;Which stock should I buy?  Can you give me a hot tip?&rdquo; My answer is still, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;  Then they question skeptically, &ldquo;How can you invest when you don&rsquo;t know anything? Isn&rsquo;t that too risky?&rdquo; My response is, &ldquo;You must invest and manage your finances without knowing the answers to these questions to succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why invest when the answers are unknown and the future is uncertain? The reason is simple: While the future is full of risks, one thing is certain: as long as the economy continues to grow and corporate profitability rises, the long-term return on investment in the stock market will inevitably surpass bank deposits, and by a significant margin.  Repeatedly avoiding worthwhile risks will prevent you from building wealth.</p>
<p><strong>How to Cultivate a Risk-Taking Spirit</strong></p>
<p><em>A courageous risk-taker is not someone without fear, but someone with the power to overcome it.</em></p>
<p>The spirit of adventure isn&rsquo;t innate; it&rsquo;s developed through practice, through taking risks, failing, taking risks again, failing again‚Ä¶ step by step.</p>
<p>Everyone is capable of taking risks, and everyone has had the experience of taking bold risks.  As toddlers, we dared to stand and learn to walk, falling and getting back up countless times.  Learning to ride a bicycle involved numerous falls, followed by getting back up, falling again, and getting back up again, until we finally mastered it. Most life skills, such as swimming, skating, driving, public speaking, and so on, are not innate instincts.  Learning these skills requires going through a phase of risk-taking, embracing the spirit of perseverance, and trying repeatedly.  Learning investment and financial management is no exception; it requires this standard process of risk-taking.  To become a successful investor, you must first discard the habit of risk aversion, rediscover your lost instinct for adventure, and cultivate a healthy risk-taking spirit.</p>
<p>Does investing have to be extremely risky?  In reality, the risks involved in investment and financial management are no greater than the examples mentioned above.  It&rsquo;s just that as we reach an age where we believe we are qualified to manage finances, our risk-taking spirit has diminished significantly. As children, almost everyone learns to walk.  A little older, most learn to ride a bicycle.  But as we grow older, the number of people who learn more adventurous activities like swimming and skating decreases considerably.  In adulthood, the number of people comfortable with public speaking dwindles even further.</p>
<p><strong>Our risk-taking spirit seems to fade with age.  This is partly because experiencing failures and mistakes naturally leads to frustration and discouragement. Without sufficient motivation, we tend to avoid taking risks to minimize the blow of failure.  Another contributing factor is traditional education.  Out of a desire to protect children, adults often reprimand them for any risky behavior, instilling a habit of prioritizing safety and avoiding mistakes.  Children then strive to be &ldquo;good kids&rdquo; who never do anything wrong.  As we age, this risk aversion becomes ingrained. While avoiding risk isn&rsquo;t inherently bad, excessive risk aversion becomes a significant obstacle to successful investment and financial management.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The First Priority of Financial Management: Overcoming Fear</strong></p>
<p>When individuals can control their fear, they can control their thoughts and actions.  Self-control enables them to remain calm in chaotic environments, make necessary decisions without being paralyzed by the uncertainty of the outcomes, and be prepared to bear the consequences of failure when things don&rsquo;t go as planned. This courage and risk-taking spirit in the face of danger are essential qualities for investors.</p>
<p><strong>Courageous risk-takers are not fearless; they simply recognize risk and overcome their fear of it.</strong> Courage stems from controlling fear, and cultivating a risk-taking spirit begins with understanding risk.</p>
<p>To become a successful investor, you must first discard the habit of avoiding risk.  Admittedly, changing long-held risk-averse habits is no easy feat.  However, since risk-taking is an indispensable element of successful financial management, the first priority in learning to manage your finances is to overcome fear and force yourself to take risks.  Cultivate a healthy risk-taking spirit, invest bravely in assets with high expected returns, and bear the associated risks.</p>
<p><strong>Top performers in any field achieve success by bravely facing their fears and taking calculated risks.</strong> Those who achieve financial success and fulfill their dreams through investment share this same spirit of adventure. <strong>Remember: excessive caution hinders success.  Without a spirit of adventure, dreams will forever remain dreams.</strong></p>

<p>Skilled risk-takers never test the depth of the water by stepping in with both feet. They extend one foot first, and if the situation seems unfavorable, they quickly withdraw.  An African proverb states, &ldquo;Only a fool tests the depth of the water with both feet.&rdquo;  Similarly, only a fool would go all-in without any investment experience.</p>
<p><strong>Gain Experience with Small Amounts of Money</strong></p>
<p>When faced with unfamiliar investment opportunities, don&rsquo;t put all your eggs in one basket. Start small.  Skilled generals don&rsquo;t expose their main forces to unnecessary danger.  To gather intelligence and gain an advantage, they deploy small reconnaissance units deep into enemy territory to identify low-risk, high-impact attack strategies.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to investment risk-taking strategies.  When dealing with unfamiliar investments, unclear situations, or a lack of confidence, avoid going all-in.  Start small, using small amounts of money to gain experience and familiarize yourself with the situation. Once you have sufficient experience and confidence, then you can invest larger sums.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, &ldquo;All things are difficult before they are easy.&rdquo; The best way to overcome fear is to confront what you fear head-on.  Since risk-taking is an essential part of building wealth through investment, don&rsquo;t shy away from it.  Start with small investments to build your risk tolerance.  With experience, the feeling of fear will gradually dissipate.  By progressively overcoming small fears, you can then face larger risks. You&rsquo;ll soon discover that the experience gained through risk-taking is helping you steadily approach your dreams.</p>
<p><strong>Once You&rsquo;re Used to Risk, You&rsquo;ll Find It&rsquo;s Not So Scary</strong></p>
<p>Risk aversion is human nature, but don&rsquo;t let a single investment failure shatter your confidence and prevent you from investing again, turning you into a perpetual loser.  Conversely, don&rsquo;t let a stroke of good luck make you forget the existence of risk, leading you to borrow heavily and invest recklessly, resulting in irreparable losses.  Successful and unsuccessful investors alike fear risk; they simply react to it differently.</p>
<p>Dear readers, if you haven&rsquo;t tried investing yet, take the plunge for the sake of building wealth!  If you take appropriate risk mitigation measures after investing, I can assure you from experience: &ldquo;The risks of investing are actually quite small, even smaller than the risk of riding a bicycle.  After 10 or 20 years of investing, when you see your wealth growing rapidly, the feeling will be hundreds of times better than riding a bicycle.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The first element of investing is a strong adventurous spirit, seeking to generate substantial risk premiums between risk and safety.</strong> No matter what investment you choose, as long as it offers high expected returns, risk is inevitable. Investors should embrace calculated risks and accumulate financial knowledge and experience along the way. Risk naturally decreases with accumulated knowledge, and wealth grows at an increasing pace.</p>
<p>This book dedicates significant space to discussing risk because the biggest challenge people face in financial management is their inability to confront risk directly.  They don&rsquo;t know how to face or manage risk, and some are even afraid to take any risks.  They don&rsquo;t realize that the biggest obstacle to successful investment and financial management is the fear of risk. This mindset is understandable, as most investment and financial management decisions are made amidst uncertainty and change. In short, to achieve financial success through investment, you must be willing to take calculated risks. Currently, many people suffer significant losses due to blind risk-taking and involvement in high-risk speculative activities.</p>
<p>If you are unwilling to take risks and prefer a conservative approach, be prepared for a life of mediocrity, as this is unavoidable. Of course, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with a conservative and mediocre life if it brings you happiness. The choice is yours. <strong>People usually regret the things they didn&rsquo;t do, not the things they tried.</strong> Therefore, my advice is: <strong>Take risks, but be cautious and learn how to manage them.</strong></p>

<p>The Chinatrust Financial Holding Co., one of the top five conglomerates in Taiwan, was led by Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Koo&rsquo;s Group, and Jeffrey Koo, chairman of Chinatrust Commercial Bank. The Koo&rsquo;s Group encompassed seven major business segments: finance, manufacturing, construction, hotels, media, services, and overseas operations, with over 50 affiliated companies and total assets exceeding NT$460 billion. Many wondered how this uncle-nephew duo achieved both political and business success, and who was wealthier.</p>
<p><strong>The Wealth Race Between Koo Chen-fu and Jeffrey Koo</strong></p>
<p>Wealth often correlates with personality. Koo Chen-fu was a slow and steady type, while Jeffrey Koo was more of a go-getter.  Due to their vastly different personalities, their investment approaches also differed significantly.  Koo Chen-fu&rsquo;s eldest son, Eugene Koo, the general manager of China Life Insurance in Taiwan, understood them well. He once said, &ldquo;Money put in Koo Chen-fu&rsquo;s pocket would never come out, but money put in Jeffrey Koo&rsquo;s pocket would disappear.&rdquo;  This was because Jeffrey Koo continuously reinvested his money, leading to greater wealth accumulation than his uncle. Jeffrey Koo&rsquo;s personal assets were spread across the US and Japan, invested in real estate, funds, hotels, golf courses, and banks.  Koo Chen-fu, in his 80s, was quite conservative. Regarding his financial management philosophy, he said, &ldquo;I neglect financial management and don&rsquo;t want to worry about money.&rdquo;  His personal income was deposited in the bank by his secretary, and aside from necessary expenses, the rest was converted into fixed-term deposits.</p>
<p>Over the years, Koo Chen-fu naturally had more cash on hand, as his money remained in the bank. However, in terms of wealth creation, Jeffrey Koo far surpassed him. Despite a 17-year age difference, with proper investment, one could still come out ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Investing $1,200 Monthly Can Make You a Billionaire in 40 Years</strong></p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s not what you don&rsquo;t know that gets you into trouble. It&rsquo;s what you know for sure that just ain&rsquo;t so.</em></p>
<p>The first concept to understand about investment is: <strong>Investment not only improves financial situations but also allows anyone to achieve wealth.</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s illustrate with a simple example:</p>
<p>Suppose a young person with no savings starts saving NT$14,000 annually for 40 years.  If this money is invested in stocks or real estate with an average annual return of 20%, how much wealth will they accumulate after 40 years?</p>
<p>The author often asks this question in lectures. Most guesses range from NT$2 million to NT$8 million, with a maximum of NT$10 million. The correct answer, however, is a surprising NT$102.81 million!  For a 25-year-old, saving NT$14,000 annually (equivalent to $1,200 monthly) for 40 years, with a total investment of NT$560,000, could result in becoming a billionaire by age 65, assuming a 20% annual return in stocks or real estate.</p>
<p>This figure is calculated using the future value of an annuity formula in finance and investment. The calculation is as follows:</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mn>1.4</mn><mo>√ó</mo><mfrac><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0.20</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>40</mn></mrow></msup><mo>‚àí</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mn>0.20</mn></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>10281</mn><mspace linebreak="newline"></mspace></math>
(Units are in NT$10,000)</p>
<p>This formula illustrates how small amounts of money can grow significantly through investment.  Understanding the formula isn&rsquo;t crucial; most people who become billionaires through investment don&rsquo;t know it, and knowing it doesn&rsquo;t guarantee success.</p>
<p>Therefore, with youth, ambition, investment knowledge, and three key factors‚Äîsaving NT$14,000 annually, investing in stocks or real estate, and patiently waiting for 40 years‚Äîanyone can achieve wealth through investment, regardless of their current economic situation.  These three factors are attainable for everyone:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Saving NT$14,000 annually (NT$1,200 monthly) should be manageable for most. (If you can&rsquo;t save this much, focus on saving before investing. This book may not be as helpful yet, as you need some capital to start investing.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Historically, the long-term average return on stocks and real estate has been above 20%.  Consistently investing in these assets and holding them long-term can yield a 20% average return. These investment tools are accessible to everyone. (Data shows that the Taiwan stock market has averaged around 20% annual returns over the past 20 years; studies show similar returns for Taiwan real estate over the past 40 years.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>40 years seems long, but it&rsquo;s a timeframe most people have.  Starting work between 20 and 25 and retiring at 65 provides a 40-year investment window.  While some are born rich and others poor, most have a fair chance at accumulating wealth over 40 years.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This example shows that investment not only improves finances but also provides a path to wealth.  With the right concepts and practices, anyone can achieve wealth through investment.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Investing Can Shorten the Journey by 10 Years</strong></p>
<p>While the initial example uses 40 years to demonstrate the power of investing, most readers are likely in a better position. They may already have savings and can save more than NT$14,000 annually, shortening their path to wealth.</p>
<p>The table below illustrates the wealth accumulation over 10-year intervals using the previous example (investing NT$14,000 annually with a 20% return):</p>
<p>If you have NT$360,000, congratulations! You&rsquo;ve saved 10 years of effort. By continuing to invest in stocks or real estate, you could become a billionaire in 30 years. With NT$2.61 million, you&rsquo;ve saved 20 years. With NT$16.55 million, you&rsquo;re even closer, needing only 10 more years.</p>

<p><strong>Investing Doesn&rsquo;t Require Advanced Knowledge</strong></p>
<p><em>The trouble with the world is not that people know too little, but that they know so many things that just aren&rsquo;t so.</em></p>
<p>Many believe investing requires perfect timing and extensive financial knowledge.  This isn&rsquo;t entirely true.  After years of studying investment, and witnessing ordinary people achieve wealth through it, I can confidently say that investment success doesn&rsquo;t depend on academic qualifications, intelligence, technical skills, or predictive abilities.  It depends on doing the right things. Successful investors aren&rsquo;t necessarily highly educated or technically skilled; they can be ordinary people who understand fundamental principles.</p>
<p>By doing the right things, anyone can achieve wealth through investment, regardless of their background or effort. Investing doesn&rsquo;t require genius or specialized knowledge; common sense and consistent action are key. Investors don&rsquo;t need to rely on experts; with the right mindset, you can outperform them.</p>
<p>Investing isn&rsquo;t about complex techniques; it&rsquo;s about having the right mindset.  Successful investors simply cultivate habits that most people find uncomfortable or difficult to maintain. Do you understand that investing can create wealth? If so, are you actively pursuing it?</p>
<p>From another perspective, investing can be challenging. The difficulty lies not in needing advanced knowledge, but in going against ingrained habits. This is difficult for most people.</p>
<p>This book presents seemingly simple investment concepts, but wealth is built through consistent, correct habits. Start your investment journey by building the right habits!</p>

<p>A Taiwanese proverb says, &ldquo;People have two legs, money has four.&rdquo; Money chases money faster than people chase money.</p>
<p>Traditional wisdom dictates that &ldquo;the path to wealth lies in diligence and frugality.&rdquo;  This held true in times of economic stagnation, but in today&rsquo;s rapidly changing economy, this mindset requires adjustment.</p>
<p>A century ago, before modern economics became widespread, during periods of economic stagnation and frequent wars, saving was indeed crucial for wealth accumulation. Today, however, with global economic growth and soaring stock and real estate prices, the focus should shift from saving to leveraging the power of compound interest for exponential growth.</p>
<p><strong>How Did Lien Chan Become Wealthy?</strong></p>
<p><em>With so many assets, it&rsquo;s impossible to monitor everything closely. During the period of entrusted management, the principle was to hold existing investments and not trade stocks or dispose of real estate.</em></p>
<p>Lien Chan, with an estimated net worth of nearly NT$6 billion, was one of Taiwan&rsquo;s wealthiest officials. His wealth wasn&rsquo;t accumulated through decades of frugal living on a government salary or through earning a doctoral degree.  It stemmed from his mother&rsquo;s shift in investment strategy over 40 years prior.</p>
<p>Around 1951, Chang Pin-san, former chairman of Chang Hwa Bank, advised Lien Chan&rsquo;s father, Lien Chen-tung, to invest in shares of the &ldquo;Big Three&rdquo; commercial banks.  Following this advice, Lien Chan&rsquo;s mother, Chao Lan-kun, invested her savings in hundreds of shares of Chang Hwa Bank, holding them long-term and letting their value appreciate naturally. This laid the foundation for the Lien family&rsquo;s fortune. Chao Lan-kun had a keen financial mind. Unlike other women who participated in rotating savings and credit associations or simply deposited money in banks, she actively invested.  She sold ancestral farmland in Miaoli and co-developed a property on Nanjing West Road with Huang Lie-huo, founder of Wei Chuan Foods Corporation, splitting the profits. This prime real estate became a significant source of wealth for the Lien family.</p>
<p>Stocks, real estate, and land were the Lien family&rsquo;s wealth-generating tools. Over the years, Lien Chan accumulated holdings in 19 different stocks, including Chang Hwa Bank, Taipei Business Bank, Hua Nan Bank, and Cathay Life Insurance.  His real estate holdings were located in prime areas like the Da&rsquo;an, Shilin, and Zhongshan districts, including 11 plots of land and 26 properties.</p>
<p>Lien Chan once described his family&rsquo;s investment approach as &ldquo;Wu Wei Er Zhi&rdquo; (doing nothing and achieving everything), meaning buying and holding long-term.  By investing in stocks and real estate 40 years ago and patiently holding them, with minimal trading and benefiting from annual returns exceeding 20%, they amassed a fortune nearing NT$10 billion.</p>
<p>You might argue that the Lien family was already wealthy 40 years ago. This might be true, but the point is that while they were prominent, many families in Taiwan were wealthier back then. Today, very few families surpass the Liens in wealth.  This is attributed to their early adoption of the correct investment strategy ‚Äì focusing on stocks and real estate.</p>
<p><strong>The Key to Wealth Lies in Financial Management, Not Just Saving</strong></p>
<p><em>The ability to earn money is less important than having a mind for financial management, understanding how to make money work for you.</em></p>
<p>Chinese culture values diligence and frugality.  Older generations often teach younger ones that the path to wealth lies in these principles and careful budgeting.  The saying &ldquo;Great wealth comes from heaven, small wealth from frugality&rdquo; encourages thriftiness, as it&rsquo;s seen as the key to wealth.  This emphasis on saving is reflected in Taiwan&rsquo;s high savings rate.  However, I want to convey a crucial message: while saving is important, financial management is even more so.</p>
<p>In the previous example, how much of the NT$100+ million fortune came from diligence and frugality? The answer is NT$560,000, accumulated by saving NT$14,000 annually for 40 years.  This represents only 0.5% of the total.  The remaining 99.5% came from investment, specifically the power of compound interest at a 20% annual return over 40 years.  Which is more important, saving or investing? <strong>Therefore, lifetime wealth accumulation depends not on how much you earn, but on how you manage your money.</strong></p>
<p>If a worker realizes in old age that their wealth primarily comes from a lifetime of hard work and saving, it&rsquo;s almost certain they won&rsquo;t be very wealthy.  The key to wealth through investment isn&rsquo;t the ability to &ldquo;earn and save,&rdquo; but the ability to leverage the &ldquo;compounding power of money.&rdquo;  For most, improving their financial situation requires focusing on investment, not just saving.</p>
<p>Consider this: saving NT$1 million annually without investing would take 100 years to reach NT$100 million. In contrast, investing NT$14,000 annually could make you a billionaire in 40 years. If Chao Lan-kun had only focused on saving and not investing, would the Lien family be as wealthy as they are today?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not dismissing the importance of saving, but I want to emphasize that it shouldn&rsquo;t overshadow investment. Investment plays a crucial role in wealth accumulation.  For successful investors, wealth comes primarily from &ldquo;making money work for you,&rdquo; not from earning or saving. Therefore, in addition to being diligent and frugal, learn how to invest.</p>
<p>To improve your financial situation, remember: earning is important, but managing your money is more so. <strong>A correct investment mindset and wise investment choices have a greater impact on your future financial status than your current wealth or future income.</strong> For most, the first step towards improving their finances is not to increase saving, but to understand the correct investment concepts and take action.</p>
<p><em>1. For those who achieve wealth through investment, their fortune comes primarily from making money work for them, not from earning or saving.</em></p>
<p><em>2.  Less than 1% of a NT$100 million fortune comes directly from earned income.</em></p>
<p><em>3.  Investment is not a technique, but a mindset.</em></p>
<p><em>4. The key to financial management is having money to manage, not the amount of money.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who learn to invest are like having a money-printing machine.</p>

<p>A study indicates that in recent years, the public has perceived a serious wealth gap in Taiwan, with a trend towards wealth polarization. Over 47% of respondents believe that &ldquo;speculation in stocks or real estate&rdquo; is the main cause of this widening gap, followed by &ldquo;personal work ability and effort&rdquo; (14%) and &ldquo;family background&rdquo; (11%).  This suggests a common belief that the wealth gap isn&rsquo;t solely due to individual effort, but also to systemic issues, luck, and unequal opportunities.</p>
<p>Indeed, &ldquo;stocks and real estate&rdquo; are major contributors to the wealth gap, while &ldquo;personal work ability and effort&rdquo; and &ldquo;family background&rdquo; have less impact. <strong>People often attribute their poverty to external factors like systemic issues, luck, or lack of opportunity, or use negative terms like &ldquo;speculation&rdquo; to explain their lack of action.</strong> Wealthy individuals often accumulate their wealth through real estate or stock investments, not primarily through &ldquo;speculation,&rdquo; but through &ldquo;holding appropriate investment assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the wealth gap will likely continue to widen. Some will benefit, while others will suffer, depending on their ability to navigate the changing landscape. External factors alone don&rsquo;t determine our financial situation; our investment abilities play a crucial role.</p>
<p><em>1. Financial habits create the difference between the rich and the poor.</em></p>
<p><em>2. The prerequisite for building wealth through investment is allocating assets to high-return investments like stocks or real estate.</em></p>
<p><em>3. One way for the government to address the widening wealth gap is to educate the public about proper financial management.</em></p>
<p><strong>Greater Investment, Greater Returns</strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Thoughts change actions, actions change habits, habits change character, and character changes destiny.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Imagine two classmates who join the same company after graduation, holding similar positions with the same salary.  Both are equally frugal, saving NT$14,000 annually for investment. The difference lies in their approach: one keeps their savings in the bank, while the other invests in stocks. Both largely leave their money untouched after depositing or investing it.</p>
<p>After 40 years, the stock investor becomes a billionaire, while the bank saver becomes a &ldquo;millionaire.&rdquo;  While a billion represents significant wealth, &ldquo;millionaire&rdquo; now evokes laughter, being synonymous with &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; in Taiwan&rsquo;s expensive housing market.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;millionaire&rdquo; classmate, seeing their former colleague with the same starting conditions become a billionaire, might assume foul play or lottery winnings. How could their wealth differ so drastically, with one rich and the other struggling?</p>
<p>Those with less wealth often attribute the success of the wealthy to luck or illicit activities. A more positive view might be that they worked harder or were more frugal.  However, they often overlook the critical factor: financial habits. The rich and poor manage their money differently: the rich hold assets like real estate and stocks, while the poor keep their money in the bank.</p>
<p>To become wealthy through investment, one must break free from conventional thinking. An adult who couldn&rsquo;t ride a bicycle saw a child doing so and complained, &ldquo;Only agile children can ride bikes.&rdquo; The child responded, &ldquo;Agility isn&rsquo;t necessary,&rdquo; and taught the adult to ride.  The adult quickly learned but, upon parting ways, instinctively pushed the bicycle home instead of riding it.  This illustrates the difficulty of breaking free from ingrained habits.</p>
<p>If financial management is the primary cause of the wealth gap, the solution lies in improving financial literacy and encouraging people to learn more about investing.</p>
<p><strong>Focusing Solely on Saving is Outdated</strong></p>
<p><em>If one adheres to the principles of investment, it&rsquo;s hard not to become wealthy. If one doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s hard to become wealthy.</em></p>
<p>I often wonder why, after over 200 years since their ancestors arrived in Taiwan with nothing, most Taiwanese families aren&rsquo;t significantly wealthy. Perhaps the problem lies in outdated family precepts that hinder wealth accumulation.</p>
<p>Family precepts are the guiding principles passed down through generations.  Most families emphasize diligence, frugality, and academic excellence, believing these are the keys to success and wealth.</p>
<p>Many families diligently follow these precepts, raising children who are both frugal and well-educated.  However, few families achieve significant wealth through these alone.  These precepts focus on earning money, not on managing it.  To build generational wealth, families need to update their guiding principles.  While &ldquo;diligence and frugality&rdquo; and &ldquo;academic excellence&rdquo; remain valuable, add another: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep money in the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why retain &ldquo;diligence and frugality&rdquo;? While saving alone won&rsquo;t lead to great wealth, it&rsquo;s a virtue and a necessary foundation for investment.</p>
<p><strong>Educating the Next Generation Requires a Balanced Approach</strong></p>
<p>Why keep &ldquo;academic excellence&rdquo;?  Studies show a weak correlation between education and wealth.  Academic success doesn&rsquo;t guarantee financial success.  Based on this, I once stopped emphasizing academics with my children, resulting in declining grades.  Their teacher, puzzled, asked, &ldquo;You and your wife are both highly educated, why don&rsquo;t your children share this trait?&rdquo; I was ashamed.</p>
<p>I immediately reinstated the emphasis on academics. I realized it was partly for our own pride, but also because education can enhance social standing and job security. So, for both parents and children, academic pursuits remain important.</p>
<p>However, for future generations to prosper, add another precept: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep money in the bank!&rdquo;  Encourage children to invest in assets like stocks and real estate, rather than leaving money in low-interest bank accounts.  Otherwise, building significant wealth might take generations.</p>
<p>Every Lunar New Year, I buy stocks for my children instead of giving cash. My second-grader is already learning the importance of investing over saving. This concept should be ingrained early as part of family values, fostering a healthy financial mindset from a young age.</p>
<p>In conclusion, most family precepts are outdated.  Building wealth for future generations requires new concepts and practices.  By updating family values and changing how we accumulate wealth, families can achieve lasting prosperity.</p>
<p><em>1. Diligence, frugality, and academic excellence alone are not enough for building lasting wealth.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Teach children not to keep money in the bank, cultivating a proper investment mindset from a young age.</em></p>
<p><em>3.  Leaving money to children might sustain them for a few years; teaching them how to manage it can provide for a lifetime and for generations to come.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>This chapter introduces the authors&rsquo; motivation and methodology for surveying millionaires and paints a typical picture of an American millionaire: they are mostly self-made entrepreneurs who live frugally and focus on investment rather than conspicuous consumption.</li>
<li>Through analyzing affluent individuals from diverse racial backgrounds and professions, the authors reveal the relationship between wealth accumulation and factors like racial origin and career choices, emphasizing the crucial role of &ldquo;frugality&rdquo; in wealth building.</li>
<li>The authors introduce the concept of &ldquo;Big Hat, No Cattle,&rdquo; referring to the phenomenon that many who appear to be millionaires are not truly wealthy, while many genuine millionaires live modest, frugal lives.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>This chapter delves into the theme of &ldquo;frugality,&rdquo; highlighting it as the foundation of wealth accumulation.</li>
<li>By comparing the lifestyles and consumption habits of &ldquo;Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAWs)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Under Accumulators of Wealth (UAWs),&rdquo; the authors demonstrate the decisive impact of frugality on wealth accumulation. For instance, the contrasting cases of Mr. Ford, a lawyer with high spending habits, and Mr. Richards, a mobile home dealer who lived frugally, ultimately show that Mr. Richards accumulated almost five times the wealth of Mr. Ford.</li>
<li>This chapter points out that most American millionaires are first-generation affluent individuals who practice a lifestyle of saving more than they spend, refraining from splurging on luxury items like expensive clothing, watches, and cars. They accumulate wealth but maintain a moderately frugal lifestyle.</li>
<li>This chapter also introduces a crucial wealth formula: <em>Age multiplied by realized pretax annual household income, divided by 10, minus inherited wealth, equals your expected net worth.</em> Using this formula, readers can calculate their expected net worth and assess whether they are PAWs, UAWs, or &ldquo;Average Accumulators of Wealth (AAWs).&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li>This chapter explores the importance of efficiently allocating &ldquo;time, energy, and money&rdquo; for wealth accumulation.</li>
<li>By comparing how PAWs and UAWs allocate these three resources, the chapter illustrates that PAWs prioritize long-term planning, investment strategies, and risk management, while UAWs tend towards instant gratification, impulsive spending, and a lack of financial planning.</li>
<li>This chapter emphasizes the importance of household budgeting, stating that even high earners need to meticulously plan and control expenses to accumulate wealth.</li>
<li>The authors point out that PAWs spend significantly more time on financial planning than UAWs, and PAWs prefer to invest in appreciating assets like stocks and real estate, while UAWs tend to spend their money on consumer goods.</li>
<li>The authors advise readers to manage their household finances like a business, creating a budget, controlling expenses, and regularly reviewing investment plans.</li>

<ul>
<li>This chapter uses the car-buying habits of millionaires as an example to further illustrate the principle that &ldquo;being financially independent is more important than displaying high social status.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The authors categorize millionaire car buyers into four types: &ldquo;New-Car Dealers&rsquo; Conservatives,&rdquo; &ldquo;New-Car Shoppers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Used-Car Dealers&rsquo; Conservatives,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Used-Car Shoppers.&rdquo;</li>
<li>By analyzing the purchasing behaviors of these four types, the authors find that &ldquo;Used-Car Shoppers&rdquo; are the most frugal, highly price-sensitive, and adept at leveraging various channels to find the best deals. This group is also the most likely to become PAWs.</li>
<li>This chapter also notes that most millionaires buy American-made cars, and many buy used cars. They believe that cars are depreciating assets and there&rsquo;s no need to spend excessively on new ones.</li>

<li>This chapter explores the phenomenon of &ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care,&rdquo; where parents provide substantial financial assistance to their adult children, often leading to the children&rsquo;s lack of financial independence and drive, ultimately hindering their ability to accumulate wealth.</li>
<li>By comparing the wealth accumulation of children who receive &ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care&rdquo; with those who don&rsquo;t, the authors illustrate the negative impact of this practice. For example, the case of Rama and Mary, a couple who received long-term financial support from Mary&rsquo;s parents, ultimately developed high spending habits and failed to accumulate wealth.</li>
<li>This chapter analyzes the causes of &ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care&rdquo; and offers suggestions to help affluent parents avoid the tragedy of &ldquo;shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations.&rdquo; For instance, parents should teach their children frugality and financial management instead of solely providing financial aid.</li>
<li>This chapter points out that adult children who receive gifts from their parents generally perform worse in wealth accumulation compared to those who don&rsquo;t. This is because receiving gifts can foster dependence and a tendency to spend the money on consumption rather than investment.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Wealth is not the same as income. If you make a good income each year and spend it all, you are not getting wealthier. You are just living high. Wealth is what you accumulate, not what you spend.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote highlights the book&rsquo;s core message: wealth accumulation is not solely based on high income but also relies on frugal habits and smart investment skills. High income doesn&rsquo;t equate to wealth; only by converting income into assets can one achieve true financial freedom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Frugality is the cornerstone of wealth building.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote emphasizes the crucial role of frugality in wealth accumulation. Only by controlling consumption can one free up more funds for investment, leading to wealth growth. Frugality doesn&rsquo;t mean living an austere life but rather being a rational consumer and avoiding unnecessary waste.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To build wealth, minimize your realized (taxable) income and maximize your unrealized income (wealth that is not taxed until it is converted to cash).&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote reveals a vital strategy for wealthy individuals to accumulate wealth, namely, achieving wealth growth through investment rather than solely relying on salary income. One must skillfully utilize tax policies to convert income into tax-advantaged assets like stocks and real estate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not yet wealthy but want to be someday, never purchase a home that requires a mortgage that is more than twice your household&rsquo;s total annual realized income.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote offers practical advice for those in the early stages of wealth accumulation: avoid excessive mortgage burdens and allocate more funds towards investment. When funds are limited, prioritize investment over consumption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Those who are financially independent are considerably happier than those in the same income/age cohort who are not financially secure.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote illustrates the importance of financial security for personal happiness. Possessing sufficient wealth allows individuals to face life&rsquo;s challenges with greater confidence. Economic independence is the foundation of personal freedom and a crucial guarantee of happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Never tell children that their parents are wealthy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote provides valuable educational advice for affluent parents: avoid letting children know about the family&rsquo;s wealth too early to prevent them from developing dependence and a lack of initiative. Children need to understand that wealth is created through their own efforts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No matter how wealthy you are, teach your children to be self-sufficient and frugal.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote emphasizes the importance of frugality and self-discipline. Even children from affluent families should develop good habits to better adapt to future challenges. Children need to understand that frugality is a virtue and a prerequisite for success.</p>

<p>The theme of this session is <strong>Embrace the New Bull Market and Invest Long-Term.</strong> James believes that the global monetary easing policy and the rapid development of AI technology herald the arrival of a new bull market. He advises everyone to invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ or 00662) and view market fluctuations with a long-term perspective.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A new bull market is coming:</strong>  The world has entered an era of loose monetary policy with the start of a rate cut cycle, which will drive the stock market up. This bull market may be a slow one but will continuously rise.</li>
<li><strong>Invest confidently in the Nasdaq 100 index fund:</strong> QQQ could increase by 50 times in the next 20 years, with an annualized return of over 20%, making it the best investment target.</li>
<li><strong>Individual stocks are unreliable:</strong> Individual stock investment is risky, and in the long run, almost all of them will disappear. They are very difficult to outperform the market in the long term. It is recommended not to waste time and energy on stock selection.</li>
<li><strong>Do not invest in the Chinese stock market:</strong> The Chinese stock market is not mature enough; consider investing in it after 30 years.</li>
<li><strong>Comparison of household asset allocation in the US and Taiwan:</strong>  American families invest most of their assets in securities to create social value, while Taiwanese families prefer cash, insurance, and real estate, locking up funds in non-appreciating areas.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging through stock pledges:</strong> Using stock pledges to borrow increases liquidity and allows for continued investment to enjoy the benefits of compound growth. With an understanding of asset allocation, the interest cost of borrowing can be almost negligible.</li>
<li><strong>Plan for retirement early:</strong> Young people are advised to invest in 00662, and retirees can choose 00646 (SPY) or 0056 according to their fund size.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasize family education:</strong> Parents should cultivate their children&rsquo;s financial management concepts from an early age, guide them to make long-term investments, stay away from bad habits such as short-term speculation and gambling, and lead by example.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t blindly trust high-yield investment products:</strong> Any investment product promising high returns may be a scam. It is important to understand its operating mechanism and learn to discern between true and false.</li>
<li><strong>The dangers of short-term trading:</strong> Short-term trading will miss the best investment opportunities. Long-term investment in index funds will yield more stable returns.</li>
<li><strong>The purpose of cash allocation:</strong> It is not for profit, but for dealing with emergencies like unemployment or a market crash. It is advisable to keep more than 10% of your assets in cash.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Lending is more powerful than the atomic bomb; it&rsquo;s ten times the atomic bomb!

</blockquote>
<p>When encouraging people to use stock pledges for borrowing and investment, James used this analogy to vividly illustrate the power of leverage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investing should be easy and fun.
&ndash;  Hola</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what a listener said when she shared her investment experience. She also tried short-term trading, but finally found that long-term investment suited her better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each person has a different destiny when it comes to money.

<p>The theme of this episode is &ldquo;Investing and Financial Management, Wealth is a Gift.&rdquo; The core viewpoints  are: <strong>Wealth is innate, but one must be informed to realize it; investing and financial management is an important way to accumulate wealth; index investing is an effective method to achieve long-term stable growth; rational asset allocation and risk control are the keys to investment success; and overcoming psychological barriers in investment and solidifying the long-term investment philosophy are crucial to ultimately achieving financial freedom.</strong></p>

    </span>        
    
</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth is a Gift:</strong> Wealth is innate, and being informed of this fact makes a huge difference. While successful entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are a minority, most people need to be told that &ldquo;wealth is a gift,&rdquo; and they need to learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Index Investing and Compound Interest:</strong> Index investing is an effective way to achieve long-term stable returns, and its compounding effect is astonishing. For example, investing $1,500 per month for 40 years with a 14% annualized return will yield $2.6 million. <strong>Even small amounts of money can accumulate considerable wealth through consistent long-term investment.</strong></li>
<li><strong>High Risk, High Return?</strong>: High risk doesn&rsquo;t necessarily lead to high returns. Whether you can bear the risk determines whether you can ultimately achieve high returns. Don&rsquo;t overestimate your risk tolerance. Your risk appetite should be determined by an asset allocation that you can withstand even if your investment goes to zero. <strong>For example, if you cannot afford the risk of TQQQ going to zero, you should not invest in TQQQ.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Choosing Investment Targets</strong>: It is recommended to invest in the global Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ). Those with insufficient funds or who are already retired can consider investing in SPY or high-dividend ETFs. Avoid investing in individual stocks because they tend to disappear over the long term, while index funds can continue to exist. <strong>The half-life of individual stocks is 10 years; out of 100 stocks, there may be less than three left after 50 years.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Investment Mindset</strong>: The market will eventually rise, and investment requires patience. Always stay optimistic, even if the investment goes to zero. Learning about investing and financial management requires continuous thinking, like peeling an onion, layer by layer, to elevate the energy of the spiritual level. <strong>Investing is like the Yellow Mountain, eternally unchanging, yet different every day; every learning experience will bring new insights.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation</strong>: Asset allocation is like building a house; it is a big project that requires comprehensive planning, not something simple. It is necessary to consider many factors, such as whether you are retired, your age, income, debt, and cash flow, to formulate a reasonable asset allocation plan. <strong>You need to carefully study the articles and videos on asset allocation provided by James to develop a plan that suits you.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do Not  Blindly Trust External Information</strong>: Financial professionals often only consider their interests, so do not easily believe their advice. Think independently, study carefully, and do not be swayed by external information and noise. <strong>Most of the outside information is garbage; do not be affected by it, focus on learning James&rsquo; investment philosophy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Balancing Risk and Reward</strong>: Do not excessively pursue high returns or completely risk-free investments; balance risk and reward. Avoid changing investment strategies easily to prevent additional costs due to frequent trading. <strong>James&rsquo; investment methods can guarantee asset appreciation and relative safety, avoiding extreme situations.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing: Learning about investment is like peeling an onion; at first, the amount of information is overwhelming, but as you learn more, you will gradually understand the core idea and ultimately reach the realm of &ldquo;the great Dao is simple.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: What do you think about the idea that &ldquo;investing is simple&rdquo;?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Such views often mistake ignorance for inaction and do not truly understand the complexity and risks of investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: How should we communicate with friends who don&rsquo;t understand index investing?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can start by briefly introducing the concept and advantages of index investing and suggest that they watch related videos to learn. Don&rsquo;t force them to accept it, everyone has their own choices. <strong>Just like preaching, we can only try our best to spread the message; whether it&rsquo;s ultimately accepted depends on the individual.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LAN:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: How to calculate Beta? What is the actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can refer to the link to the article on Beta calculation on the message board. The actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF may deviate from the theoretical value due to factors such as market volatility and friction costs. <strong>When market volatility is large, the wear and tear of leveraged ETFs will be more serious, resulting in an actual Beta value lower than the theoretical value.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Why is there a huge difference in final return between scenario 3 and scenario 4.1 in the 005 topic?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Scenario 4.1 is where no money is withdrawn from the investment, so the final return will be higher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: How to adjust Beta in a rising market?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response:  The adjustment of Beta should be determined by your own risk tolerance, not by the market trend. <strong>Do not try to predict the market, just keep a fixed Beta value.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 4:  For investments in Taiwan, should I choose Q2D or 00670L?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: 00670L is recommended because it includes New Taiwan dollar hedging, which can reduce the risk caused by exchange rate fluctuations. <strong>Don&rsquo;t change investment targets frequently, choose one that suits you and hold it for the long term.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Wealth is a gift, just as self-confidence is a gift; everyone has potential, but it needs to be stimulated. The key to investing and financial management lies in learning. Once you have mastered the correct investment method, you can focus on your own career and life and let wealth grow naturally over time. <strong>Overcome fear, build confidence, and you can realize your potential, gain wealth, and achieve success.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Understanding &ldquo;buy whenever you have money,&rdquo; but still finding it difficult to overcome psychological fluctuations when the market rises or falls sharply.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response:  Overcoming psychological fluctuations takes time and experience. You can try to make a small number of trades, experience the impact of market fluctuations, and gradually adapt to market changes.</li>
<li>IM Supplement: You can overcome psychological barriers by imagining starting to invest two years later and understanding that &ldquo;money arrives at different points in time.&rdquo;<strong>Don&rsquo;t worry about buying at the lowest point; as long as you stick to long-term investment, you can get good returns.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hai Rui Ji:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thank you James for selflessly sharing your investment philosophy; students learn from each other and make progress together.</li>
<li>James&rsquo; investment philosophy requires continuous learning and understanding to grasp it fully. &ldquo;Never sell&rdquo; does not mean you cannot sell, but that you should develop a reasonable investment strategy based on your own situation. ** &ldquo;Never sell&rdquo; refers to mentally ignoring market fluctuations and adhering to a long-term investment philosophy.**</li>
<li>Investment philosophy needs to keep pace with the times and adjust investment strategies according to changes in the environment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question: Already answered in the video.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Li Zi:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: To overcome psychological barriers to investment, manage accounts separately, using one part for long-term investment and the other for tentative operations, such as selling covered calls. This satisfies the desire to trade and avoids losses due to frequent trading.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You only know what is best after you have experienced it. Experience in trading can lead to a firmer commitment to a long-term investment strategy. <strong>Trying different trading strategies can help you understand the advantages of long-term investment and ultimately achieve the state of &ldquo;daily reduction for the Dao.&rdquo;</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>T:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Why has the capital market in mainland China performed poorly for a long time?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Emerging markets take time to mature. The Chinese market is like the Taiwanese market 50 years ago. It has the potential to rise in the long term, but its return may be lower than that of the US market. <strong>Investment should focus on sustainable development markets. The US market has advantages in terms of systems and industries.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Under foreign exchange control, how do I invest in US index funds? Are there any risks?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can invest by purchasing ETFs listed in China that track US index funds, such as 513100. Foreign exchange controls mainly restrict the physical flow of funds, and buying ETFs is not restricted. The current scale of such investment is small and will not trigger a quota limit. <strong>Even with foreign exchange control, it is still possible to allocate global assets through legal channels.</strong></li>

<p>Everyone has the potential for wealth, but they must be informed to realize it and learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning Increases Daily, the Dao Decreases Daily
&ndash; IM</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learning about investing and financial management is a process of continuous improvement. At first, you will be exposed to a large amount of information, but as your understanding deepens, you will gradually simplify your investment strategy and eventually reach the state of &ldquo;the great Dao is simple.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Difficult to Return to After Seeing a Vast Ocean
&ndash; Li Zi &amp; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only after experiencing something can you know what is best. In investing, only after actually operating and experiencing market fluctuations and the impact of different investment strategies can you more firmly choose the long-term investment strategy that suits you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The More Money You Borrow, the More Money You Have
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understand and control risk, not avoid it. Understanding how to use leverage can accelerate wealth growth, but only with proper risk management, such as building a solid asset allocation.</p>
<blockquote>
