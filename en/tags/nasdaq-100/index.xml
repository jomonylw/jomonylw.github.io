<p>This episode focuses on the mindset and strategies that investors should adopt in the context of current market volatility and volatile international situations. James emphasizes that for long-term investors, short-term market fluctuations, macroeconomic conditions, and even wars should not be of excessive concern. The core strategy should be to insist on buying high-quality index funds (such as Nasdaq 100 QQQ) and holding them for the long term, never selling. At the same time, he shares an updated Excel financial simulation tool, discusses pre-retirement withdrawal strategies, leverage management, the significant advantages of early Roth conversion, and how to build a strong investment psychology to cope with external pressure and complex information.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore the Noise, Keep Buying:</strong> Macro factors such as market volatility, international situations, tariff wars, trade wars, hot wars, and cold wars have little to do with long-term investing. Investors cannot and do not need to predict or respond to them. Just keep buying index funds (QQQ) and holding them for the long term.</li>
<li><strong>Halving is Inevitable:</strong> In the long-term investment process, a 50% or even greater reduction in assets is an inevitable event, not a matter of probability, but a certainty. Investors need to be psychologically prepared and ensure that they can still &ldquo;survive&rdquo; in this situation. Ask yourself every day: &ldquo;If the market halves again, can I still hold on?&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Long-Termism and Optimistic Mindset:</strong> Investing requires patience, and wealth is worth waiting for. The market always goes up in the long run. Investors should always be extremely optimistic, even if the market drops 80%, because the decline is part of the investment process, and the future is always bright. Buying is for future gains, not for leaving the market out of fear of future declines.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Origin and Background of the Problem:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some students reported problems with the old Excel version: 1) Increasing the spending ratio may actually reduce the final assets; 2) After a significant increase in assets (such as from 1 million to 4 million), spending directly at 2% of the new assets (i.e., 80,000) failed the stress test when simulating the 2000 tech bubble burst.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Main Updates and Usage Suggestions:</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Separating Spending and Rebalancing Ratios:</strong> Corrected the error of linking the spending ratio with the smart rebalancing ratio. The new version allows independent settings. It is recommended that the smart rebalancing ratio remain at 2% or be adjusted according to individual risk tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>New Strategy for Increasing Spending After Asset Growth (0.8% Rule):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simulation Conclusion:</strong> If assets increase significantly (such as from 1 million to 4.6 million, net worth 3.8 million, and borrowing 780,000 accounting for 17% of total assets), spending directly at 2% of the new assets (80,000/year) is too risky.</li>
<li><strong>Safety Recommendation:</strong> When assets have increased by more than <strong>2.5 times</strong> and the pledged loan ratio is controlled within <strong>20%</strong>, consider increasing the annual spending to <strong>0.7% or 0.8% of the new total assets</strong>. For example, assets of 4.6 million can spend about 36,800/year (4.6 million * 0.8%). After this adjustment, even if you encounter a market shock similar to 2000, you can maintain a sufficient margin of safety. This means that if assets grow 2.5 times, the annual spending can safely increase by about 2.2 times.</li>
<li><strong>Operation Guide (Using the &ldquo;Practice Version&rdquo; Excel):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Enter &ldquo;Scenario Nine&rdquo; (applicable to situations where you have started pledged borrowing and spending).</li>
<li>Modify the &ldquo;Amount Already Borrowed&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo; or &ldquo;Scenario Eight Nine Information&rdquo; area in the front of the table (<strong>do not directly change the S2 cell inside Excel, go to the overview page in front to change it</strong>).</li>
<li>Return to the scenario nine simulation page and modify the initial asset allocation ratio (such as QQQ 33%, QLD/Leverage 45%, Cash 22%).</li>
<li>Adjust the &ldquo;Borrowing Expenses&rdquo; percentage (located in column T, such as changing to 0.8 or 0.7).</li>
<li>Adjust the &ldquo;Borrowing Interest&rdquo; according to the actual situation (cell S5, such as setting it to 3% for Taiwan).</li>
<li>Observe the &ldquo;Minimum Maintenance Rate&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Minimum Equity Ratio&rdquo;) in the results and ensure that it is higher than your set safety threshold (such as 150% or 160%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cash Interest Assumption:</strong> When calculating the compound interest on the Cash portion in Excel, the interest rate used is half of the borrowing rate (S5) (i.e., <code>S5/2/12</code> calculated monthly). This is based on the conservative assumption that the deposit rate is usually lower than the borrowing rate and does not need to be modified.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Version Description:</strong> Provides &ldquo;Easy Version&rdquo; (only needs to fill in the initial total assets, smart rebalancing %, and annual spending %) and &ldquo;Practice Version&rdquo; (allows you to modify more detailed parameters inside Excel, such as initial allocation ratio, profit transfer ratio, initial borrowing ratio/amount, withholding cash ratio, etc.). To perform detailed simulations and parameter adjustments, you need to use the &ldquo;Practice Version.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario Analysis:</strong> Compare a couple aged 50 with 2 million in Traditional IRA, expected return of 14%, and tax rate of 24%, under three different Roth conversion strategies for the long term (to age 100).
<ul>
<li>Scenario 1: No conversion, relying on RMD. The final assets are approximately <strong>330 million</strong>.</li>
<li>Scenario 2: Work until age 56 and then start converting. The final assets are approximately <strong>350 million</strong>.</li>
<li>Scenario 3: Retire immediately at age 50 and start converting. The final assets are as high as <strong>780 million</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Core Conclusion:</strong> Retiring 6 years early to perform Roth conversion, utilizing the low tax bracket window in the early stage of retirement, can bring more than <strong>300 million USD</strong> in additional wealth. Even for high-income earners (assuming a conversion tax rate of 40%), it takes an additional 9-10 years of work to make up for the huge opportunity cost of not converting early. <strong>It is strongly recommended that those who meet the conditions plan and execute Roth conversion as soon as possible.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Make Good Use of Financial Tools (Transmissive Power):</strong> Specifically pointed out that Taiwan&rsquo;s low interest rate environment provides investors with favorable conditions to use borrowing (pledged loans, etc.) to amplify investment returns (transmissive power).</li>
<li><strong>Bank Perspective and Customer Relationships:</strong> Banks view deposits as liabilities and loans as assets. They are happy to see customers borrow and pay interest on time. Large borrowing customers are VIPs of the bank and enjoy preferential treatment; ordinary depositors need to go through regular procedures.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth Circulation Mechanism:</strong> Commercial banks play an intermediary role in the capitalist system, transferring the idle funds (deposits) of risk-averse/non-investors to investors (borrowers) who are willing to take risks and know how to use funds, and earn interest spreads from them. Understanding this mechanism helps investors use leverage more confidently.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Coping with External Pressure:</strong> When facing the worries or doubts of family and friends when the market falls, you need to build a strong inner self:
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Belief:</strong> First of all, you must be firm in your investment philosophy and understand that volatility is a normal process.</li>
<li><strong>Shielding and Transcendence:</strong> Practice from the realm of &ldquo;not listening, not seeing, does not exist&rdquo; to &ldquo;both seeing and listening but also does not exist,&rdquo; that is, the inner self is not disturbed by external words.</li>
<li><strong>Positive Attitude:</strong> Show confidence and a good state to the outside world (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, no problem, the market will rise&rdquo;).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decluttering and Value Ordering (Refer to Video 00351 &ldquo;Enlightenment&rdquo;):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Life should be simplified, and clarifying what you &ldquo;don&rsquo;t want&rdquo; is more important than what you &ldquo;want.&rdquo; Reducing unnecessary material pursuits and social relationships can bring more freedom and focus.</li>
<li>Reflect on the core values of life, such as &ldquo;relationships,&rdquo; &ldquo;sense of contribution,&rdquo; &ldquo;health,&rdquo; and &ldquo;soul&rdquo; shared by students, and work is only a part of it.</li>
<li>Get rid of the shackles of seeking external recognition (refer to &ldquo;The Courage to be Disliked&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Love and responsibility for children are the fundamental values that many people find difficult to give up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Beware of Information Cocoons (Refer to Video 00420 Logic Class):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Realize that we may all be trapped in &ldquo;information cocoons&rdquo; by network algorithms, only accessing homogeneous information, resulting in a narrow vision and loss of independent thinking ability, like &ldquo;parrots&rdquo; repeating views.</li>
<li>Actively seek different information sources, use <strong>critical thinking</strong>, especially the ability to <strong>falsify</strong>, and maintain skepticism about the information received (first assume that 99% is wrong).</li>

<li><strong>Share:</strong> Taiwanese firefighter, 40 years old, new investor (started in February), adopting a 442 allocation (40% QQQ, 40% leverage, 20% cash), investing approximately 6 million. Recently experienced a large single-day drop of 28% in the leveraged portion, but stated that they could withstand it. Few friends shared the same philosophy. Believes that never selling can achieve financial freedom.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comments:</strong> Thank you for sharing. The 442 allocation is more aggressive, and this decline is a good stress test. Reminded that firefighting work is physically demanding, and investment should focus more on stability. Suggested adjusting the allocation according to their own comfort level, such as 433 or more conservative 424 or even 505. The primary goal of asset allocation is to make yourself &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; and able to hold it for the long term. Cash is the key to &ldquo;surviving.&rdquo; When facing external doubts, maintaining a strong inner self and confidence is the most important.</li>

<li><strong>Share:</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Life Reflections:</strong> Reviewing last week&rsquo;s homework, combined with &ldquo;How Will You Measure Your Life?&rdquo; and Brian Dyson&rsquo;s five-ball theory, clarified that the second value of life is &ldquo;relationships,&rdquo; &ldquo;sense of contribution,&rdquo; and &ldquo;treating nature well&rdquo;; emphasized the irreplaceability of health, family, friendship, and soul; the current most wanted to get rid of is &ldquo;seeking recognition from others&rdquo;; believed that life regrets often stem from &ldquo;things not done.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Origin of Excel Questions:</strong> Deeply studied Excel and discovered problems due to concerns about smart rebalancing causing Beta to continue to rise (such as &gt;1.2) and wanting to increase living expenses (at 2% of new assets) after asset growth.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Can leveraged ETFs (such as 00670L) commonly used by Taiwanese investors be included in the Excel model to calculate the maintenance rate (market value)? If included, even with a higher Beta (such as 1.24), it seems that a 433 allocation can pass the test.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Philosophy of Life:</strong> Appreciated the in-depth thinking. Emphasized the importance of &ldquo;decluttering&rdquo; and clarifying &ldquo;what not to want.&rdquo; Agreed that there is no need for others to recognize, and shared that they value their relationship with their children the most. Recommended video 00351 &ldquo;Enlightenment.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Excel and Taiwan Applications:</strong> Theoretically, the market value of leveraged ETFs can be included in the maintenance rate calculation. The existing model is based on the US situation and is conservative (high interest rate assumptions, not explicitly including the market value of leverage), aimed at being universal and safe. Taiwanese investors can take advantage of the no capital gains tax (easy to reduce leverage) and lower interest rates, and modify Excel themselves (such as changing the interest rate and adjusting the maintenance rate formula) to better fit reality. If the model can pass, it is usually easier in Taiwan. Thanked them for their question, which prompted the optimization of the &ldquo;how to increase spending after asset growth&rdquo; strategy (0.7%-0.8% rule or reducing leverage).</li>

<li><strong>Question:</strong> Observed that the recovery time of historical bear markets seems to be shortening. Combined with the evolution of US financial policies (QE, pandemic response, etc.), does it mean that the government&rsquo;s control efficiency has improved and the market recovery is accelerating?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Agreed with the observation. With the accumulation of financial theory and practical experience, policy tools are more effective, and the ability to respond to known crises has indeed increased, shortening the recovery period. But the real risk lies in <strong>unknown, unprecedented crises</strong>. There is no need to worry too much about known patterns, and be optimistic about the future but have risk awareness.</li>

<li><strong>Share:</strong> 433 allocation is already All in. Although they thought they were prepared, when actually facing the decline, it was difficult to bear the pressure from their parents&rsquo; &ldquo;caring&rdquo; worries, and they were even afraid to tell them about the losses. Glad that this decline occurred when the invested proportion was not yet high.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How to cope with this kind of caring pressure from relatives and friends (especially parents)? (Especially for office workers who cannot physically avoid it like retirees).
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Cannot control others, only cultivate the inner self. From shielding information (&ldquo;not listening, not seeing, does not exist&rdquo;) to the inner self not being disturbed (&ldquo;both seeing and listening but also does not exist&rdquo;). The key is to have firm self-belief, understand the current situation, and show confidence to the outside world (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine&rdquo;). The decline is the norm for investing, or a good opportunity to rebalance. When the inner self is strong enough to realize a certain illusion of the external world, its influence can be reduced.</li>

<li><strong>Investment Indicators:</strong> The criteria for judgment is the composition of the top ten technology companies in the world by market value. If it is still dominated by the United States, then there is no need to change the strategy. If the future pattern changes significantly (such as non-US companies accounting for more than half), consider adjusting the proportion accordingly. Unlikely to happen within 50 years.</li>
<li><strong>Specific Concerns:</strong> Much information may be amplified or biased (information cocoon effect). Believe in the basic integrity system and institutional resilience of American society. Individual incidents (such as anti-vaccine rhetoric, measles outbreaks), while worrying, are unlikely to subvert the entire system. Stay focused, but don&rsquo;t panic, and focus on verifiable facts.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>James/ÊÖ∂ (Qing) Response:</strong> This is the design assumption of the model: The <strong>deposit rate</strong> (cash yield) is set to half of the <strong>borrowing rate</strong>. This is a simplified, conservative estimate that reflects the reality of the bank&rsquo;s deposit and loan interest rate spread. The formula <code>principal * (1 + S5/2/12)</code> is correct, reflecting this safety margin, and does not need to be modified.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Market volatility, international situations, trade wars, hot and cold wars&hellip; have nothing to do with our investment, just buy, don&rsquo;t sell. Long-term is investment.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Emphasizes that long-term investment should focus on holding high-quality assets, ignoring short-term market noise and macro events.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will definitely encounter several opportunities for asset depreciation of 50% in the market, this is not a probability problem, this is a certainty.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Reminds investors that a significant market correction is an inevitable part of long-term investment and that they need to be psychologically and financially prepared for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asset allocation is not done for performance, asset allocation is done for your comfort.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Explains that the primary goal of asset allocation (especially the proportion of cash holdings) is to ensure that investors can hold it with peace of mind and get through the cycle, rather than simply pursuing the highest returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commercial banks are intermediaries that transfer the money of the poor to the rich for use, and this revolving door takes place in banks. This is the reason why the capitalist system makes the poor poorer and the rich richer.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Reveals the core role of the modern banking system in capital flow and its impact on the wealth distribution pattern.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who borrow money are VIPs&hellip; those who don&rsquo;t have much money and don&rsquo;t borrow money, please go to the counter to draw a number and line up.
&ndash; James (quoting student Benson&rsquo;s observation)</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Vividly compares the vast difference in the way banks treat large borrowing customers and ordinary depositors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You push out all the things you don&rsquo;t want first&hellip; then what are the things you have left that you want? It&rsquo;s very little&hellip; the less you want, the less homework you have.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Applies the concept of &ldquo;decluttering&rdquo; to life planning, advocating that by reducing desires and unnecessary pursuits, inner freedom and focus can be achieved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are besieged by the network and locked in an information prison, you can&rsquo;t break out&hellip; all our thoughts are not our thoughts&hellip; we are all parrots.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Deeply warns of the erosion of individual cognition and independent thinking ability by &ldquo;information cocoons,&rdquo; calling for vigilance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both seeing and listening but also does not exist.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Describes an advanced state of psychological practice, where even when exposed to negative or disturbing information, the inner self can remain calm and unaffected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things that have happened in the past are less worried about, we are worried about things that have never happened before.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Distinguishes between known and unknown risks, pointing out that historical experience helps to deal with recurring crises, but the real challenge lies in dealing with new, unknown shocks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you retire six years early (to perform Roth conversion), you will be short of 300 million (USD).
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Based on simulation calculation results, strongly emphasizes the huge long-term wealth effect that can be brought about by using the low tax rate window to convert Roth IRA/401k as early as possible.</p>

</h2>
<p>This lecture, against the background of increased market volatility, strengthened the core concept of long-term investment: ignore the noise and insist on holding high-quality index funds (QQQ). James not only updated and explained in detail the important financial planning tool Excel model (especially the adjustment of withdrawal strategies after asset growth), but also persuasively demonstrated the amazing value of doing Roth conversion as early as possible. At a deeper level, the course focused on the construction of investment psychology, discussed how to understand and use financial system rules, how to cope with external pressure (worries from relatives and friends, social information) with a strong inner self, and especially emphasized the extreme importance of maintaining independent thinking and being wary of &ldquo;information cocoons&rdquo; in the era of information explosion. The ultimate goal is to help investors cultivate both their inner skills and achieve a double improvement in cognition and mindset on the road to pursuing financial freedom.</p>

<p>Many of us spend our entire lives struggling with money, working tirelessly for monthly bills, children&rsquo;s tuition, and meager retirement savings, like a hamster trapped in a cage, running hard but never escaping. Have you ever considered that you could have been richer? Have you ever thought that the sense of security you seek actually binds you, causing you to miss out on greater wealth?</p>
<p>Yes, everyone has an innate talent for wealth, a right we are born with, as natural as breathing, as natural as birds flying and fish swimming. Unfortunately, this right, this talent, has been forgotten, or even buried by our own hands through the &ldquo;education&rdquo; of reality and the &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; of society. From a young age, we are told: study hard, find a good job, work hard to earn money to support the family. No one tells us: you can be very rich, you have the right to be very rich, you don&rsquo;t even have to work so hard to have it all!</p>
<p>The value of this lecture is far more than teaching you one or two investment techniques; its true value lies in awakening you from that ‚Äúhamster dilemma,‚Äù making you realize your dormant wealth potential, and showing you a path to financial freedom. This path does not require you to have Einstein&rsquo;s brain, nor does it require you to have Buffett&rsquo;s luck, it only requires you to change your mindset, and then, to move forward steadfastly.</p>

<p>The extent of your vision dictates the height of your wealth. This isn&rsquo;t just some motivational slogan; it&rsquo;s a conclusion derived from rigorous logic and data analysis. Don&rsquo;t believe it? Let&rsquo;s crunch some numbers.</p>
<p>Many people find investing for something decades into the future to be too distant and unrealistic. But what if we look 60 years into the future? If you have 1 million now, through sensible investments and factoring in the power of compounding, you could have assets worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in a few decades. This is entirely possible; it‚Äôs actually a conservative estimate.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t ordinary people realize they can have so much wealth? The reason is simple: our concept of money is too narrow, we have insufficient understanding of our potential, and we lack a deep understanding of compounding, the &ldquo;eighth wonder of the world!&rdquo; Our understanding of money is still at the kindergarten level, while financial giants have a Ph.D.-level understanding of money, at least.</p>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<p>Why is it so hard for most salaried workers to escape the &ldquo;rat race&rdquo; dilemma? Because they are trapped in a carefully designed cycle: you work hard for a month, and before the paycheck even warms up, it has to go to capitalists, the government, and the bank. For that meager salary, you have to work like a rat running tirelessly in a cage, never escaping that vicious circle.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that society constantly brainwashes you with &ldquo;consumerism,&rdquo; telling you that buying big houses, luxury cars, and branded bags is the standard for successful people. So, you&rsquo;re burdened with heavy loans, barely able to breathe under the weight of monthly interest payments. You don&rsquo;t dare to quit your job easily, and you don&rsquo;t dare to challenge your boss. You become a complete slave to capital.</p>
<p>Do you think this is your own choice? Do you think it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re not working hard enough? No! This is a structure intentionally or unintentionally maintained by the entire society and education system. What do schools cultivate? Compliant cogs in a machine, not independent-thinking creators. Financial institutions design complex financial products, ostensibly to help you manage your money, but in reality? They earn high fees and interest, while you can&rsquo;t even outpace inflation.</p>
<p>This ‚Äúcontrolled environment‚Äù prevents you from realizing your potential for wealth, let alone changing your situation. You are like that hamster in the fable, the faster you run, the further you get from freedom.</p>

<p>Poverty is not your fault; it is the result of social structures that create class inequality. This structural inequality is like a thick curtain that obscures your innate talent for wealth, making you believe that you can only live a poor or middle-class life.</p>
<p>The statement &ldquo;wealth is a talent&rdquo; is not just a platitude, but a declaration, a solemn proclamation of your right! It tells you: you have the right to pursue a life of abundance, you have the right to enjoy beautiful things, you don&rsquo;t have to sacrifice your health, your happiness, or your dreams for money!</p>

<p>What is money? Money is a kind of energy, a tool. In a capitalist society, money can be used to exchange for various resources and services, including time, happiness, health, and even freedom. Money can also be used for investment, growing more money like seeds.</p>
<p>But remember, money itself is not the goal, but a means to achieve our life goals. We make money not to become slaves to it, but to live better, to realize our own dreams and those of our families, to have the ability to help those in need, and to better serve society.</p>
<p>Only by truly understanding the essence of money can we view it and use it correctly, rather than being enslaved by it.</p>

<p>Can ordinary people really achieve financial freedom? The answer is: of course they can! Moreover, achieving financial freedom is much simpler than you imagine.</p>
<p>The key to financial freedom is not about having a high IQ, or mastering complex techniques, but rather whether you have the correct investment mindset and whether you can persevere in executing it.</p>
<p>The path to financial freedom for ordinary people is actually very simple: choose the right investment vehicle, hold it for the long term, and let the power of compounding increase your wealth like a snowball. Specifically, it&rsquo;s recommended to invest in the U.S. Nasdaq 100 index fund, a relatively low-risk investment choice with excellent long-term performance. In the long run, its annualized return is considerable.</p>
<p>Many people might say, investing in index funds, isn&rsquo;t that something even an idiot can do? Yes, it&rsquo;s that simple! But the problem is, how many people can truly hold on for the long term?</p>
<p>Financial freedom is not achieved overnight; it requires patience and perseverance. In the course of investing, you will encounter all sorts of challenges and temptations, but as long as you believe in your choice and continue steadfastly, you will surely reach the other shore.</p>

<p>The biggest characteristic of the &ldquo;poor mindset&rdquo; is self-limitation. They habitually limit themselves with &ldquo;impossible,&rdquo; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; and &ldquo;too difficult.&rdquo; They don&rsquo;t see their potential or the hope for the future.</p>
<p>The key to shedding the &ldquo;poor mindset&rdquo; lies in changing your mindset and recognizing your wealth potential and rights. You have to believe that poverty is not your destiny, and that you have the ability to change your fate.</p>
<p>Specifically, you need to learn the right investment knowledge, rather than being led by so-called financial experts or the media. You need to understand that true wealth comes from long-term investment, not short-term speculation or blind consumption. You need to learn to delay gratification, using the money you save for investment, rather than for buying things that are non-essential.</p>
<p>More importantly, you need to cultivate the ability to think independently, not to be swayed by others or blindly follow trends. You need to develop an investment plan suitable for your own circumstances, and then steadfastly execute it.</p>
<p>Finally, you must remember that financial freedom is not something that happens overnight; it requires patience and perseverance, believing in the power of compounding, and adhering to long-term investment.</p>

<p>Why invest? The answer is simple: to make money work for us, not us for money.</p>
<p>Through investing, we can make our money grow continuously in the capital markets, thus realizing an increase in wealth. This increase can help us withstand inflation, ensure our future quality of life, and ultimately achieve financial freedom, so we no longer have to toil for a living.</p>
<p>Investing is also a way to plan for and secure the future. Through investment, we can accumulate funds for retirement, prepare for our children&rsquo;s education, and create conditions for realizing our dreams. Imagine, when you retire, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about whether your pension is enough, you can travel the world freely, do things you love, what a wonderful life that would be!</p>
<p>In addition, investing is also a way to participate in economic development. By investing in excellent companies, we can share the dividends of their growth, and also create value for society, promoting social progress.</p>

</h3>
<p>Why is it better to start investing early? The answer lies in the word &ldquo;compounding.&rdquo; Compounding, which Einstein called the &ldquo;eighth wonder of the world,&rdquo; is more powerful than you think.</p>
<p>For example, if we calculate with a 12% annual rate of return (a figure that can be achieved over the long term), a 30-year-old who invests $283 per month can accumulate approximately $1 million by the age of 60. But if they started investing at the age of 20, they would only need to invest $85 per month to reach the same goal!</p>
<p>See that? That is the power of compounding! The earlier you start investing, the less principal you need, and the shorter the time it takes to achieve your wealth goals. Because the effect of compounding causes your wealth to grow like a snowball, the longer the time, the faster the growth rate, and the greater the power.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if you don&rsquo;t have much capital right now, as long as you start investing early and stick with it over the long term, you can accumulate a considerable amount of wealth. Time is the best friend of investment.</p>

<p>Many people think bonds are a stable investment, and some even say they&rsquo;re safer than stocks. Is this really the case?</p>
<p>In the long term, bonds can actually be riskier than stocks. Don&rsquo;t believe it? Let&rsquo;s look at the data. How have different asset classes performed over the past 200 years, from the early 19th century to the early 21st century? The results show that the long-term returns of stocks are far higher than those of bonds, and bonds have sometimes even lost money over periods of 20 or even 30 years!</p>
<p>Why is this the case? Because the yield on bonds is usually low, making it difficult to withstand the erosion of inflation. Moreover, bond prices are affected by interest rate fluctuations and carry some risk. In contrast, although stocks fluctuate more in the short term, they have higher growth potential in the long term.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about real estate. Many people believe that buying a house is the most value-preserving investment, and some even consider their house their most important asset. However, have you ever considered whether real estate is really a good investment?</p>
<p>From an investment perspective, the main problems with real estate are its poor liquidity, high maintenance costs, and unremarkable long-term returns. Imagine if someone spent 10 million Taiwan dollars to build a villa 35 years ago, could that villa be worth 30 million Taiwan dollars 35 years later? It‚Äôs unlikely. However, if they had invested that 10 million Taiwan dollars in the stock market, based on historical average returns, the current value would have increased by two orders of magnitude, possibly becoming 1 billion Taiwan dollars!</p>
<p>More importantly, real estate also involves complex factors such as location and market fluctuations, all of which can affect its investment returns, and ordinary people find it difficult to control them.</p>
<p>And what if you treat your home as a place to live? Then you&rsquo;ll be burdened with decades of loan payments, and monthly mortgage repayments will weigh you down. For this house, you have to work hard, not dare to quit easily, and not dare to pursue your dreams, you become a complete ‚Äúhouse slave.‚Äù Isn&rsquo;t that putting the cart before the horse?</p>
<p>Remember, a home to live in is essentially a consumption, not an investment.</p>

<p>Why should we look to the United States? Because it is a fertile ground for innovation, an environment where great companies are born.</p>
<p>The United States is home to the world&rsquo;s best companies and top scientific talent. These companies are like perpetual motion machines, continuously driving technological progress, creating new products and services, and leading global economic development.</p>
<p>Moreover, the U.S. is highly innovative, and the government usually supports the development of businesses. Furthermore, the U.S. capital markets are relatively mature and transparent, with well-established regulatory mechanisms that protect the rights of investors. This provides a relatively fair and safe investment environment for investors.</p>

<p>For ordinary people, investing in individual stocks requires specialized knowledge and a lot of effort, and the risks are also relatively high. Is there a simpler, more effective way for us to share in the dividends of U.S. technological development?</p>
<p>The answer is: the Nasdaq 100 index fund.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq 100 index fund includes the 100 largest and most representative non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq, which include many well-known tech giants such as Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.</p>
<p>These companies represent the future development direction, the future of technology, with strong innovation capabilities and huge growth potential. By investing in the Nasdaq 100 index fund, we are investing in these excellent tech companies at the same time, sharing in the generous returns from their growth.</p>
<p>Moreover, investing in index funds is very simple, transparent, and relatively low-cost, making it particularly suitable for ordinary investors to hold for the long term. Compared to actively managed funds that require a lot of time and effort for research, index funds often outperform in the long run.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq 100 index fund is more focused on the tech sector compared to other broad market indices, which means it has higher growth potential. If you believe that technology is the core driving force behind future development, then the Nasdaq 100 index fund is an investment choice you cannot afford to miss.</p>

<p>The method of investing in index funds is really simple: choose a good index fund, such as the Nasdaq 100 index fund, and then buy in regularly, holding it for the long term. It&rsquo;s that simple. You don&rsquo;t need a background in finance, nor do you need to monitor the market every day. You can even leave it untouched for years.</p>
<p>But why is it that so few people are actually able to do this simple thing?</p>
<p>First, it requires you to have a long-term perspective and firm conviction. During market fluctuations, especially when the market is down, many people feel panic and anxiety, and even doubt their choice, eventually giving in and selling, and as a result? They often sell at the lowest point, missing out on the rebound that follows.</p>
<p>Second, it requires you to overcome your human weaknesses. In the course of investing, you&rsquo;ll encounter all sorts of temptations: today, this stock has hit its limit up, tomorrow, that concept is hot, the day after tomorrow, experts predict the market will plummet‚Ä¶ this noise will interfere with your judgment, leading you to deviate from your original investment plan.</p>
<p>Many people, even those who have learned this simple investment method, still cannot do it well. Some investors are impatient to sell as soon as the market rises slightly, missing out on the big gains that come later; some investors, although they have set a fixed investment plan, are always unable to stick to it, going at it haphazardly; and other investors, because they hold other types of stocks or investments, are unable to make up their minds to switch to index funds.</p>
<p>What does all of this show? It shows that the success of investing depends not only on the method, but also on your mindset, whether you can overcome your human weaknesses, and whether you can steadfastly execute your investment plan.</p>
<p>Investing in index funds requires &ldquo;patience&rdquo; and &ldquo;waiting,&rdquo; the determination to &ldquo;stay the course&rdquo;, which is what most people lack.</p>

<p>The path of investment is full of all sorts of &ldquo;pits,&rdquo; and one wrong step can lead to total ruin.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Financial Expert&rdquo; Scam:</strong> Many so-called &ldquo;financial experts&rdquo; are actually just salespeople for financial products. In order to earn commissions, they will recommend various complex financial products to you, such as insurance, bonds, annuities, etc. These products often come with high fees and less-than-ideal long-term returns. Annuity products in particular, are not only low-yielding and high-risk, but also severely impact your asset allocation and tax planning. Remember, truly good investments are often simple, and those complicated products are often traps.</li>
<li><strong>Noise from the Media and &ldquo;Experts&rdquo;:</strong> Many media outlets and so-called &ldquo;investment experts,&rdquo; in order to grab attention, publish all sorts of sensational market predictions. One minute they&rsquo;re saying a bull market is coming, the next a bear market is coming, and the next, that a certain industry is about to explode‚Ä¶ This noise severely interferes with your judgment, making you unable to focus on long-term investment. Remember, what really matters is the long-term trend, not the short-term fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>The Temptation of Short-Term Trading:</strong> Many people dream of getting rich overnight, so they like to buy and sell frequently, trying to capture every market fluctuation. However, short-term trading not only requires you to have superb skills and keen market intuition, but also to bear enormous risks. For ordinary investors, short-term trading is often not worth the effort, and can even lead to serious losses. Frequent trading is like a gambler in a casino, often eventually losing it all.</li>
<li><strong>The Risks of High Leverage:</strong> Some investors, in order to pursue higher returns, use excessive leverage, such as margin accounts. However, leverage is a double-edged sword, it can amplify your returns, but also amplify your losses. If used improperly, it can easily lead to total ruin, and even bankruptcy. Remember, the first priority of investment is to control risk, not to pursue high returns. Never put your fate in the hands of luck, especially not with leveraged fate.</li>
<li><strong>The Risk of Not Learning:</strong> Many people know nothing about investment. They don&rsquo;t understand the essence of investment, nor their own risk tolerance, nor the characteristics of the products they are investing in. Such blind investment is like crossing the road with your eyes closed, full of risks.</li>

<p>&ldquo;Buy when you have money.&rdquo; These four words sound very simple, even a bit &ldquo;silly,&rdquo; right? But they are based on a deep understanding and insight into the long-term trends of the market.</p>
<p>We all know that the long-term trend of the market is upwards, driven by economic development and technological progress, and it&rsquo;s an unstoppable historical trend. Although the market will fluctuate in the short term and even fall sharply, these are all temporary. In the long run, the market will always return to the upward trend and continue to reach new highs.</p>
<p>Many people always want to buy at the lowest point and sell at the highest point. But ask yourself, do you really have the ability to do this? Not to mention ordinary investors, how many professional fund managers can actually do it?</p>
<p>Trying to choose the best time to buy is often futile, even foolish, because no one can accurately predict market bottoms and tops. Instead of wasting a lot of time and energy researching market trends, it&rsquo;s better to adopt a &ldquo;buy when you have money&rdquo; strategy, and use that time and energy to work and live life, enjoying life to the fullest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never sell,&rdquo; these four words, don&rsquo;t they sound a bit extreme? But they are the secret to enduring market cycles, the essence of long-term investing.</p>
<p>The essence of investing is to share in the growth dividends of excellent companies, not to gamble, in a casino, diving in and out. The logic behind &ldquo;never sell&rdquo; is actually very simple: as long as you are investing in excellent companies, and as long as you believe that these companies can continue to grow, then you should hold them for the long term, sharing in the dividends that their growth brings.</p>
<p>Frequent buying and selling will not only increase your transaction costs, but will also cause you to miss out on the compounding effect of long-term holding. More importantly, it will expose you to human weaknesses.</p>
<p>When the market is falling, you will feel panicked and will want to sell; when the market rises, you will become greedy and will want to chase after the price increases. As a result? You are often buying high and selling low, and are constantly harvested by the market.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;never sell&rdquo; strategy can help you overcome fear and greed, and allow you to always stay in the market, sharing in the dividends of economic growth.</p>

<p>Market downturns, for many people, are a nightmare, a disaster. But for true investors, they are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>

<p>Warren Buffett once famously said, &ldquo;Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.&rdquo; This quote is about this very principle.</p>
<p>Market downturns are temporary, while the market&rsquo;s long-term trend is upward.

<p>The strategy of &ldquo;living off stock pledges&rdquo; can help you address your daily capital needs without selling your stock. This is a smarter way to manage finances.</p>
<p>Many people might ask, what is a stock pledge? Simply put, it is using your stock as collateral to borrow money from a financial institution. In this way, you can gain access to liquidity without selling your stock, and you can continue to enjoy the long-term appreciation of your stock.</p>
<p>Through stock pledges, you can avoid being forced to sell stocks with long-term growth potential due to temporary funding shortages. Furthermore, in many countries and regions, the capital gains tax rate is usually higher than the borrowing interest rate. Through stock pledges, you can also reasonably reduce your tax burden.</p>
<p>Of course, stock pledges also carry some risks. If the stock price drops sharply, you may need to provide additional collateral or face the risk of forced liquidation. Therefore, when using stock pledges, you must control your leverage ratio, and it is generally recommended that the pledge ratio not exceed 20% of your total assets.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the ability to think independently, you can easily be swayed by this information and make wrong investment decisions.</p>
<p>Independent thinking is key to investment success. It means having your own judgment, not blindly following trends, not blindly believing in authority, and not being swayed by market sentiment.</p>
<p>The basis for independent thinking is learning and research. You need to continuously learn investment knowledge, study market laws, and understand the investment target. Only in this way can you form your own investment system and make correct decisions in the complex market environment.</p>

<li><strong>Market Trends and Investment Philosophy:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Drives the Future:</strong> AI demand is not a bubble, but a genuine driving force behind technological advancement, promising a bull market spanning two decades.  We are currently in the early stages of this growth.  Morris Chang (TSMC Chairman)&rsquo;s perspective and TSMC&rsquo;s investments in AI corroborate this judgment. The long bull market has begun, seize the opportunity to join the wealth train.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility and Long-Term Investment:</strong> Market fluctuations are inherent to investing.  Downswings are followed by even greater upswings. Using historical data from the Taiwan Weighted Index, Nikkei Index, and the US stock market as examples, the session illustrates the long-term market development pattern: an initial period of rapid growth followed by a period of stagnation (e.g., 32 years in Taiwan, 35 years in Japan, 24 years in the US), before entering a phase of stable growth.  Therefore, overcoming panic caused by market volatility and adhering to a long-term investment strategy is crucial for ultimate success.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalism and Investment:</strong>  The side effects of capitalism are wealth disparity and the exploitation of labor. Learn to operate like a capitalist and profit from investment.  Hard work and saving money to buy government bonds will ultimately result in wealth erosion due to inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits of Quantitative Easing:</strong> Quantitative easing is beneficial for investors, fostering a low-interest-rate environment and driving asset price appreciation.  Those who fail to understand quantitative easing and complain about government money printing are often victims of capitalism, missing out on the benefits of asset appreciation.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics of a Mature Market:</strong> Mature markets are characterized by fair, just, and transparent regulatory mechanisms, companies focused on their core businesses, and a high proportion of long-term investors and institutional holdings. The Taiwanese market is gradually maturing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Investment Strategies and Recommendations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invest in Nasdaq 100:</strong>  The session recommends investing in Nasdaq 100 index funds (QQQ), with the option to allocate to S&amp;P 500 or high-dividend ETFs based on individual circumstances.  References to Nasdaq 100 index funds globally are provided for the convenience of investors worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Penny Stocks:</strong>  Refrain from investing in penny stocks, as they generally offer low long-term returns.  Real investment opportunities lie in companies that demonstrate sustained growth and lead technological advancements.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of Stock Pledging:</strong> Stock pledging offers advantages over real estate mortgages, as stocks, unlike real estate, do not depreciate and can be held long-term, potentially allowing for &ldquo;borrowing without repayment or interest&rdquo; (specific instructions are available in related videos).</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Flawed Rebalancing Strategies:</strong> Avoid a 50% principal + 50% leveraged ETF rebalancing strategy, as it carries high risk and can easily deplete cash reserves during market downturns.</li>
<li><strong>Estate Planning and Stock Pledging:</strong> When engaging in stock pledging, it is advisable to diversify assets across multiple brokerage firms, pledging a portion and keeping the rest as cash to facilitate estate handling for inheritors.  Cat supplemented this with a detailed explanation of the stock pledging inheritance process, emphasizing the importance of advance planning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Other Important Matters:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Warning and Disclaimer:</strong>  The content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.  Do not remit funds to unknown accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Program Format Adjustment:</strong>  The presentation content will be expanded to include material previously covered in short videos.</li>
<li><strong>QQQ Stock Selection Mechanism:</strong>  Addresses audience questions regarding the QQQ stock selection mechanism, explaining the advantages of the Nasdaq exchange and why technology companies prefer listing on Nasdaq.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging for Non-US Residents:</strong> Explains the regulations for non-US residents engaging in stock pledging with US brokers.</li>
<li><strong>Learning to Spend:</strong> Shares the philosophy of spending after achieving investment success, emphasizing the importance of focusing on future wealth growth and utilizing financial leverage for consumption.  Don&rsquo;t let wealth sit idle; learn how to use it.  This point is illustrated with the example of a listener who has $4 million but doesn&rsquo;t know how to spend it, calculating their potential wealth growth over 40 years and a reasonable spending level.</li>

</h2>
<p><strong>IAM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Expressed confusion about different types of economic crises and how the 2020-2023 pandemic period compares to previous bubbles after reading a book about economic crises.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  Which historical economic crisis is most similar to the economic downturn during the 2020-2023 pandemic?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The 2020-2023 pandemic was an economic shock caused by an external event, distinct from previous bubble economies. The 2000 dot-com bubble was an industry bubble with limited impact; the 2008 financial crisis resembled the 1929 Great Depression, both being asset bubble bursts, but the 2008 crisis recovered faster due to quantitative easing. The 2022 market decline was not a bubble burst, but a revaluation caused by central bank interest rate hikes.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> What did the US do to stimulate the economy that other countries couldn&rsquo;t replicate?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The US is less constrained by fiscal discipline and is willing to borrow and issue debt, allocating funds to social welfare programs for the elderly, children, and healthcare, while guiding domestic capital towards overseas investment to mitigate inflation.  Taiwan&rsquo;s government was advised to learn from the US&rsquo;s fiscal spending approach and guide capital towards investment, while also focusing on efficient capital utilization and building a social safety net.</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> Why are Chinese people so keen on buying houses?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> This is a vestige of the agrarian &ldquo;land is wealth&rdquo; mentality, which is no longer applicable today.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eason (Doctor):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Points to consider for Chinese investors buying Nasdaq ETFs:
<ul>
<li>Different brokerage firms have different fee policies and financing rates; careful comparison is necessary.</li>
<li>Domestic Nasdaq ETFs have premiums; buying during periods of low or negative premiums is recommended.  There are no limits for buying ETFs on the exchange, but there are limits for off-exchange subscriptions.</li>
<li>Recommends allocating a portion of assets to USD-denominated investments like QQQ, which can be purchased by opening brokerage accounts in Singapore or Hong Kong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Added:</strong>  Chinese residents have a $50,000 annual foreign exchange quota for overseas investments.  Hong Kong and mainland China identities have different withholding tax rates on US stock investments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dave:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Will the Nasdaq 100 index become stagnant like the Dow Jones index?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Currently, the Nasdaq 100 is the most competitive; excessive worry about the future is unnecessary.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> Is it feasible to only buy the top 10 companies in the Nasdaq 100 index?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The top ten companies change frequently; individual stock selection and portfolio adjustments are too cumbersome, and returns may not be higher.  Investing directly in index funds is more efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> How do VGT and XLK compare to QQQ?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> VGT and XLK track different indices than QQQ, with different constituent stocks and concentration. QQQ is more robust and has broader coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jiawen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Can an 80% leveraged ETF + 10% cash + 10% bond portfolio be directly pledged? How is this done?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, but a small-scale trial is recommended, for instance, borrowing $200,000 against $5 million in principal, or borrowing within $1 million against $10 million. Long-term borrowing strategies should be adjusted according to circumstances. It&rsquo;s possible to pledge only a portion of the stocks, leaving the remainder for additional purchases or other uses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Personal investment journey, transitioning from real estate to stocks, learning about stock pledging and asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Is there synergy between real estate and stock investment? How can real estate cash flow be used for stock investment?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  Buying a house is not recommended for young people. Real estate investment returns are lower than stocks and come with various risks (e.g., natural disasters, property taxes).  Even with positive cash flow, opportunity costs should be considered; investing that capital in stocks might yield higher returns.  Used Texas real estate as an example to illustrate the drawbacks of real estate investment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Qiu Xiao:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  What are the Canadian equivalents of US retirement accounts like IRA, Roth IRA, and 401k? Which account should cash be held in?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Roth IRA corresponds to Canada&rsquo;s TFSA, Traditional IRA to RRSP, and 401k to DCPP. The choice of retirement account for cash depends on the individual&rsquo;s balance between taxable and tax-free accounts and their asset allocation strategy.  One should choose to place cash in either a tax-free or taxable account based on their specific circumstances for tax optimization.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2 (Related to Eason&rsquo;s question):</strong> How can one invest in Nasdaq ETFs in China, and how can quota limitations be addressed?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Off-exchange subscriptions have quota limits, while on-exchange ETF purchases do not, but premiums should be considered.  Opening multiple brokerage accounts or opening an account in Hong Kong for US stock investment can be considered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Haoqing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Used the example of SpaceX launching rockets with a small team to highlight concerns about AI replacing human labor and the difficulties young people face in finding employment.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How can we address the challenge of youth unemployment in the AI era?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  Young people need to acquire AI skills to adapt to the future job market.  Recommends that schools incorporate AI courses into their core curriculum, cultivating AI talent from a young age. Philosophy is an important foundational subject but should not be a primary career focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jimmy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Discussed the changing times and the need for young people to adapt, sharing observations about the youthful demographics of Xiamen. Mentioned the importance of aligning investments with the times and shared some common misunderstandings about investing he had encountered.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What are your views on index fund investing? Is the long-term return of 0050 sufficient? What are your thoughts on individual stock investing (e.g., TSMC)?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Index fund investing is a method accessible to the general public, but many don&rsquo;t understand it and require time and experience to appreciate it. In the long run, QQQ and SPY offer higher returns and are more suitable for long-term investment. Individual stock picking demands specialized knowledge and skills and carries higher risks; it is difficult for average investors to select and hold high-quality stocks like TSMC for the long term.  The key to investing is finding investment targets that can be held long-term and sticking with them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Q&amp;A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TQQQ Pledging:</strong>  Learn about stock pledging and how to achieve interest-free borrowing through the recommended videos.</li>
<li><strong>Top 10 QQQ Holdings:</strong>  Frequent trading is discouraged; holding the index fund long-term is sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>BOX vs. SWVXX:</strong>  BOX is recommended for brokerage accounts to avoid dividend taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Conservative Investing:</strong>  Conservative investing can involve holding cash or holding index funds long-term.</li>
<li><strong>How to Spend Money:</strong>  Focus on future wealth growth and utilize financial leverage for consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Investing in US Stocks from within China:</strong>  Coming to the US to invest or remitting funds to the US for investment is recommended.  Consider opening an account in Hong Kong or using other compliant channels for investment.</li>

</h2>
<p>The session centered on the core principle of long-term investment strategies. James reiterated his investment philosophy: &ldquo;Buy QQQ whenever you have money and hold it for the long term.&rdquo; The discussion expanded to cover aspects like investment philosophy, risk management, and values, incorporating current events and questions from attendees. James also shared insights from legendary investors like Warren Buffett, encouraging attendees to cultivate a sound investment mindset.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Buying at the Dip vs. Buying When You Have Money:</strong> James cited research from ChatGPT, indicating that even with the ability to accurately predict and buy at market dips, the long-term returns differed minimally compared to simply buying when one has available funds. Over a 20-year period, the difference was merely 8%, translating to a difference in annualized returns of less than 0.2%. Hence, rather than expending time and effort predicting market bottoms, it&rsquo;s more effective to seize opportunities and buy QQQ when you have the money.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Leveraged Funds:</strong>  Using the 2000 tech bubble as an example, James explained how leveraged funds can accelerate losses in bear markets, potentially leading to devastating financial setbacks, even bankruptcy. He simulated a scenario where an investor repeatedly buys more leveraged funds as the market declines, culminating in financial ruin. This served as a cautionary tale against the &ldquo;buy the dip&rdquo; strategy with leveraged funds, emphasizing the importance of risk management.</li>
<li><strong>Keys to Investment Success:</strong> James emphasized that the key to successful investment lies in overcoming human weaknesses. Maintaining a detached and &ldquo;unfeeling&rdquo; attitude towards invested capital and short-term market fluctuations is crucial for adhering to a long-term investment approach.</li>
<li><strong>Market Cycles:</strong> James stated he wouldn&rsquo;t teach attendees about predicting market cycles or any trading techniques. He considers these unimportant and prone to misinterpretation and misapplication, potentially leading to increased risks. He advocated for a long-term investment strategy, likening it to riding a cable car, a smooth and steady ascent to the summit of financial success.</li>
<li><strong>Money and Values:</strong> Acknowledging that individuals have different values regarding money, James advised understanding and respecting diverse values, discouraging attempts to impose one&rsquo;s own values upon others. He used the example shared by an attendee about a mother preferring a financial subsidy over a family trip to illustrate the diverse ways people assign value to things.</li>

</h2>
<p><strong>IIM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong> A story about a deceased friend, leading to reflections on money and values, and expressing confusion about balancing personal values with those of others.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  How to understand some people&rsquo;s &ldquo;frugality&rdquo; with money while being &ldquo;generous&rdquo; towards their pets.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> People manage their finances differently based on what they consider important and valuable. What might be significant to one person may hold little value for another.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> How to understand a mother who prioritizes money over a family trip? How to better understand the needs of others?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>  This mother might have certain unmet needs, possibly requiring material security before pursuing leisurely experiences. Understanding true needs involves offering more choices (e.g., money plus a trip). Avoid trying to change others&rsquo; values; focus on understanding and respecting them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong> Encountering a friend who suggested leveraging to purchase Nvidia stock, leading to questions about investment advice.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How to evaluate investment advice received from others?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>   The validity of investment advice depends on individual judgment and risk tolerance. It&rsquo;s important to avoid blindly following the advice of others and to think independently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Iny:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Experiencing a sense of calm and reduced anxiety after adopting James&rsquo;s investment approach.  This newfound peace of mind allows for dedicating more time to important matters like family, and interestingly, focusing on work has led to increased income.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to understand the phenomenon of increased income resulting from a dedicated focus on work?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> This exemplifies the principle that altruism ultimately benefits oneself. By focusing on serving clients and enhancing product or service quality, one ultimately gains client recognition and rewards, leading to higher income and a sense of accomplishment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Haoqing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared 1:</strong>  An experience with check fraud, prompting concerns about bank security and the risks of using checks.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>  Banks do not verify the identity of check depositors. Checks present security vulnerabilities, making it advisable to use safer online banking and digital payment methods like Apple Pay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Shared 2:</strong> Thoughts on the decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia, attributing this to factors like US regulations, labor laws, and unions.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> The decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia are multifaceted issues stemming from a complex interplay of factors, including national policies, labor laws, and unions. While Asian countries might resort to suppressing labor rights and environmental regulations to gain a competitive edge, the US places a higher value on worker well-being and environmental protection. This divergence in values contributes to different developmental paths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Becky:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong> Based on personal experience working in a digital payment company, Becky recommended that everyone stop using checks due to inherent security risks. Digital payment methods offer greater security and convenience, with features such as spending alerts that enable prompt response and recovery in case of issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong> As a long-time follower of James, Mike witnessed the evolution of his investment philosophy, from initially holding 30% SPY to converting to 100% QQQ, and eventually incorporating leveraged funds. He also shared personal investment experiences, like selling NIO and allocating a portion of his portfolio to private market investments.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Is investing in Intel after its acquisition worthwhile?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>  James advised against investing in large companies that are acquisitive. Acquisitions often lack efficiency, posing integration challenges and potentially hindering productivity. While acquiring smaller companies for technological advantages makes sense, acquiring large companies is akin to amassing a pile of scrap metal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong>  How to view the supply chain security concerns stemming from the US outsourcing 3C product manufacturing, citing examples like the BBB Call explosion and walkie-talkie incidents?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Espionage is ubiquitous, and supply chain security is just one facet of this broader issue. Governments might implant spy codes in chips and software for surveillance purposes. Explosions are a relatively rudimentary form of espionage; more sophisticated methods can be extremely difficult to detect and prevent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> Is it possible to offer advanced courses for more experienced attendees? He suggested using portfolio sharing as a means to differentiate attendees&rsquo; learning progress.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> James stated he wouldn&rsquo;t differentiate between attendees nor offer advanced courses. Assessing whether a student is genuinely learning is primarily based on their attitude, not investment returns or holding duration. Even portfolio sharing can&rsquo;t truly gauge learning progress. James mentioned his personal sensitivity to words and language, enabling him to discern learning attitudes from attendees&rsquo; emails and the way they pose questions.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The best time to buy is when you have money.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Many obsess over finding the perfect entry point, but research indicates that even if you could perfectly time market dips, the long-term returns barely differ from simply buying when funds are available. Instead of wasting time trying to predict the market, seize the opportunity and act promptly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To succeed in investing, you must be indifferent to the money you invest and the fluctuations in stock prices.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Overcoming the human tendency to fixate on money and fear short-term market swings is essential for maintaining a long-term investment strategy and achieving stable returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To achieve effortless investing, you need to be numb to money.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>When investing becomes a habit, free from emotional impulses and external distractions, you can achieve optimal results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept of a &ldquo;benefactor&rdquo; is relative.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>People perceive and absorb information differently. Who you consider a benefactor might not be perceived as such by others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to change other people&rsquo;s values.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone has their own values and ways of life. It&rsquo;s important to understand and respect diverse choices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Espionage is everywhere.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Information security is a growing concern. Be vigilant and protect your personal data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Acquisitions of large companies are generally inefficient, and leaders who are fond of acquisitions usually have inflated egos.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Integration complexities and high management costs associated with mergers often outweigh the benefits gained.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The US excels in areas such as finance and technology design, while Asian countries can only substitute and supplement in specific aspects.
&ndash; Haoqing</p></blockquote>
<p>Within the global division of labor, different countries have distinct strengths and weaknesses, leading to divergent paths of development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best judgments are validated by facts.
&ndash; Mike</p></blockquote>
<p>The success of an investment philosophy is ultimately determined by its long-term returns, not short-term fluctuations or gut feelings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your attitude determines my response.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>James adjusts his responses based on the learning attitude of the attendees. Attendees who are truly dedicated to learning will receive greater guidance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investing in individual stocks will ultimately lead to bankruptcy; holding onto individual stocks will also ultimately lead to bankruptcy.<br>
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Companies have lifecycles.  Holding onto a single stock long term significantly increases the risk of encountering bankruptcy. Diversification is key in investing.</p>
