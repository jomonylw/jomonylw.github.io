<p>The core of this livestream lies in exploring and shaping the correct mindset for investors. Teacher James emphasizes that successful investors, like excellent entrepreneurs, should always remain <strong>extremely optimistic</strong>, always <strong>face the sunshine</strong>, and firmly believe that the market will eventually rise. Investors need to learn to filter out all external noise—such as market volatility, international situations, and analyst predictions—and focus on the asset allocation and long-term strategies they can control. At the same time, the course delves into how to balance the rational potential for gain with emotional anxiety when facing leveraged investing, ultimately emphasizing that <strong>mental health should take precedence over potential financial gains</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Filtering Invalid Information</strong>: Teacher James points out from the start that market volatility, international situations, market analysis, financial reports, and economic conditions are all noise. Investors should not waste time on these unpredictable or uncontrollable factors. Any analysis is either hindsight or guesswork, with accuracy no better than a coin toss.</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining Extreme Optimism</strong>: The mindset of a successful investor is similar to that of an entrepreneur (like Elon Musk). Although Musk&rsquo;s companies have repeatedly faced bankruptcy, he has always remained extremely optimistic. Investors should do the same, firmly believing that the market moves upward in the long term and that technology and human society will continue to develop.</li>
<li><strong>Investor&rsquo;s Beliefs</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Investors are always extremely optimistic.</li>
<li>Investors always face the sunshine.</li>
<li>The market will eventually rise.</li>
<li>Investing requires patience; wealth is worth the wait.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Correction Regarding Chinese ETFs</strong>: Teacher James solemnly apologized and corrected his previous view, pointing out that products like the &ldquo;Southern Dividend Low Volatility 50 ETF&rdquo; (515450) in mainland China are misleading. The yield charts displayed on their websites include dividend reinvestment, while the actual stock price may be falling. He explicitly advises <strong>not to invest</strong> in such products and stated that he is still looking for suitable high-dividend solutions for investors in mainland China and Hong Kong.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of Scams</strong>: The teacher emphasized that he will not actively DM anyone on Clubhouse or other platforms, nor will he have any paid groups or manage money for others. For example, there are fake IDs in Clubhouse like <code>cchc.james</code> followed by an <code>m</code> or <code>cec.chairman</code>. Any unsolicited greetings or requests for money transfers are scams.</li>
<li><strong>Communication Channels</strong>: Questions should be submitted via YouTube comments or Email; the teacher will try to reply within two days.</li>
<li><strong>No Official Groups</strong>: CLEC has no official groups. Although some students have established WeChat groups out of goodwill, there are risks of bans and scammers infiltrating them. It is suggested that investors form small, closed groups composed of friends and family for discussion, but no group represents CLEC.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Hegemonic Status of the US Dollar</strong>: Discussed how the status of the US dollar as an international reserve currency is hard to shake. For a country&rsquo;s currency to internationalize, its industrial strength and comprehensive national power must be strong enough to provide the products and services the world needs, which is precisely the hardest part.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Exchange Rates on Individuals</strong>: For ordinary people, whether their domestic currency is an international currency matters little. Exchange rates mainly affect national <strong>purchasing power</strong>. For example, the depreciation of the New Taiwan Dollar against the US Dollar means the cost of traveling abroad will be higher. Exchange rate issues are complex political economics, involving industry, policy, history, and many other factors.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Case Analysis</strong>: A student wrote in to share his psychological conflict. Through rational analysis, he believes that leveraged investing via credit loans or mortgages can quickly accumulate principal and is a correct decision.</li>
<li><strong>Emotional Obstacles</strong>: However, when he prepared to actually borrow the money, he began to feel extreme anxiety and irritability. He couldn&rsquo;t help but watch the market every day, and even small fluctuations made him restless and unable to sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Advice</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Mental Health First</strong>: The teacher explicitly pointed out that if borrowing money to invest causes you such great psychological pressure, then <strong>do not borrow</strong>. Mental health is far more important than potential financial returns.</li>
<li><strong>The Challenge of Unity of Knowledge and Action</strong>: This case is typical of the conflict of &ldquo;wanting to get rich but afraid to carry leverage.&rdquo; Investing is like taking medicine; even if it is good medicine, if the side effects are fatal (like the severe anxiety in this case), it must absolutely not be taken.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Assessment</strong>: The fact that he thinks about details like watching the market daily and percentage fluctuations indicates that this investor has a naturally nervous personality and is not suitable for bearing the psychological pressure brought by leverage. Investing peacefully without borrowing money is the path more suitable for him.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: She is a civil servant (nurse). After listening to the teacher&rsquo;s channel, she canceled several matured investment-type insurance policies and put all funds into 00662 and 00670L for a 433 asset allocation. Because she feels her future pension is secured, she decided to retire early this year at 55 and no longer consume herself for work.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: An excellent decision. The teacher confirmed she has done asset allocation and kept a cash position (00865B), and her assets are more than 15 times her living expenses. Since her monthly pension is enough to cover daily expenses, the investment portion can grow peacefully without being touched. The teacher encouraged her to retire early and experience more of life, such as spending time with family, reading, and studying philosophy.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Having followed the teacher&rsquo;s channel for over a year, he has internalized the concepts of pledging and long-term investing, and is now indifferent to workplace politics and others&rsquo; opinions. He mentioned the positive news from TSMC&rsquo;s earnings call, stating that while most funds are still in the teacher&rsquo;s 433 allocation, he also allocated a small amount to 0050 Leveraged (2x) because he is bullish on Taiwan&rsquo;s tech strength. He is very grateful to the teacher and the community for the benevolent knowledge that allows everyone to grow together.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: AI is currently a money printer, and TSMC is at the core of the AI supply chain. It is the only non-US company in the global top ten by market cap (excluding oil companies), which is the pride of Taiwan. However, he also reminded that the growth of a great company takes a long time; TSMC, Apple, and Nvidia all went through three or four decades of development. Therefore, investing is not true investing if it&rsquo;s not for more than thirty years.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: She and her husband used to be very frugal people who lacked security regarding money. After encountering the teacher&rsquo;s investment philosophy, their mindset changed, and they recently took their family on a nine-day independent trip to Japan. However, she still felt guilty when spending money, feeling that she wasn&rsquo;t spending money earned through hard work.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How to break out of this old mindset that &ldquo;spending money makes one feel guilty&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: First, the teacher suggests she can think of it as &ldquo;spending borrowed money,&rdquo; which reduces the psychological burden. This is the rule of the capitalist game. Second, having the wealth to enjoy life is a gift and luck, and there is no need to feel guilty about it. Most importantly, happiness is good for health. Happy experiences like travel, exercise, and meditation can promote the growth of &ldquo;hippocampus&rdquo; nerve cells in the brain, helping to keep thinking clear and delay aging. Therefore, spending money for happiness and health is very worthwhile.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: His son opened a company in the US in 2025 and is confused about tax filing. The company has dividends; should he file corporate tax or personal income tax? How to plan to save more on taxes?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is a tax planning issue. Suggestions:
<ol>
<li>Keep most of the profits in the company and pay the relatively lower corporate tax (about 18%).</li>
<li>The son can take a portion of the salary from the company as personal income, keeping the marginal tax rate for personal income tax at a lower level (e.g., within 22%), roughly over a hundred thousand dollars.</li>
<li>Many company expenses can be used for tax deductions.</li>
<li>Regarding retirement accounts, <strong>it is strongly recommended to only use Roth 401K and Roth IRA; absolutely do not use Traditional (pre-tax) accounts</strong> to avoid high tax rates during future conversions.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: She has three years until retirement. She plans to convert $300,000 from her Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA annually after retirement, estimating a tax of $120,000 per year for 8 years. Currently, she can only save enough for two or three years of taxes in advance and asks how to prepare for this tax payment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Do not deliberately save money to pay taxes</strong>; solve this through asset allocation and financial tools.</li>
<li>The preferred solution is <strong>stock pledging (securities-based lending)</strong> to pay taxes. <strong>Absolutely do not sell assets in the Investment Account (Blockage Account)</strong>, because selling will generate new capital gains tax, complicating the issue.</li>
<li>Your total assets include Blockage, Roth, and Traditional accounts. Calculate if 2% of your total assets is enough to cover the annual tax.</li>
<li>If the pledging limit is insufficient, consider transferring part of the funds to Roth and another part to the Blockage account during the Roth Conversion to increase the assets available for collateral.</li>
<li>The last choice is to use tax withholding directly from the Traditional IRA during conversion, but this will lose the compound interest growth on that portion of the principal.</li>

<li>She is a new student who just repatriated funds from overseas (IB, Schwab) to Taiwan, ready to put them into the 433 allocation. Facing the current market highs, she is hesitant: should she invest a lump sum?</li>
<li>She plans to invest 20,000 monthly in the future; how should she allocate it?</li>
<li>There is a large expense at the end of March (about 9% of total assets); is it feasible to pay via pledging? How to repay the interest?</li>
<li>Should the emergency fund be independent of 00865B (cash position)?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Invest immediately</strong>. Do not time the market. According to your 433 asset allocation plan, buy at market price as soon as the funds arrive. The market is very likely to rise significantly in the future.</li>
<li>The monthly DCA amount is small, so you can buy freely. For example, buy more leverage if the market drops, replenish the cash position if it rises, and review/balance uniformly at the end of the year.</li>
<li>Paying for large expenses via pledging is completely feasible. Interest is also paid by borrowing more money through pledging; do not touch the principal.</li>
<li><strong>There is no independent emergency fund</strong>. All cash should be within your asset allocation (i.e., 00865B). We do not hold non-yielding cash. Just sell the necessary living expenses from 00865B at the beginning of each month.</li>

<li><strong>When to choose QQQI/JEPQ.L</strong>: If you are retired or semi-retired and need stable cash flow to cover living expenses, then this type of high-dividend ETF is suitable.

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Regarding S&rsquo;s question, she shared the situation in Singapore: Like Malaysia, there is no tax treaty with the US, and the 30% tax is also non-refundable. She found an alternative: <strong>JPMorgan&rsquo;s <code>JEPQ.L</code> listed on the London Stock Exchange</strong>. This is a DL (distributing/dividend-paying) ETF. Because it is listed in the UK (likely Irish-domiciled UCITS structure), Singaporean investors do not face withholding tax issues when buying it, and the final yield is similar to QQQI, perhaps even slightly higher.</li>
<li>After discussing with her family, they decided to choose larger cash flow rather than leaving a larger inheritance, believing that enjoying life in the present is more important.</li>
<li>For investors whose assets are not massive but have a relatively high demand for cash flow, a mixed strategy can be considered. For example, adding 10% QQQI/JEPQ to the portfolio can increase cash flow, and because QQQI has lower volatility, it can effectively <strong>lower the volatility of the entire portfolio</strong>, thereby reducing the risk of stock pledging.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Ling&rsquo;s point is very correct. The <code>JEPQ.L</code> solution she provided is excellent and solves pain points for non-US tax residents. At the same time, adding QQQI to reduce overall asset volatility is also a very good risk management concept.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: How does the teacher view the impact of AI on the social life and education of the younger generation?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is a common phenomenon, but there is no need to panic excessively. He used a <strong>historical analogy</strong>: If you went back to the Ming Dynasty and told people then that there would be mobile phones, airplanes, and cars in the future, they would also be terrified, worrying that carriage drivers and weavers would lose their jobs and society would collapse. But the fact is, human society adapted to technological progress, and life became better. AI is the same; it will make our lives better and better. We should embrace the future optimistically instead of peddling fear.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: For young long-term investors, after investing 30% cash during a market pullback, how can they &ldquo;earn back&rdquo; this portion of cash? Is it by reducing DCA amounts?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is a conceptual misunderstanding.
<ol>
<li><strong>Young investors do not need to keep 30% cash</strong>. The so-called 30% cash (in the 433 allocation) is mainly prepared for retirement or those who cannot bear high volatility risk.</li>
<li>For young investors in the US, the correct approach is: <strong>Prioritize maxing out Roth 401K and Roth IRA</strong>. With the remaining money, after keeping about half a year&rsquo;s living expenses, <strong>invest strictly 100% immediately</strong> into your Brokerage Account whenever you have money. Do not keep cash waiting for a pullback.</li>

<li>Funds can be sent back to Taiwan for investment. Taiwan has no tax on capital gains, which is very friendly.</li>

We are experiencing a migration from one era to another, just like moving from ancient times to modern times. Old jobs will be eliminated, but new opportunities and better lifestyles will follow.

<li><strong>Taxes must be planned in advance</strong>. Most assets can be allocated to low-dividend growth assets, such as QQQ (dividend yield only 0.6%).</li>
<li>Make full use of retirement accounts (IRA, 401K), where dividends are tax-free or tax-deferred.</li>
<li>For taxes that must be paid, pay them with a peaceful mind, because it means you made money. More importantly, <strong>use money borrowed via pledging to pay taxes</strong>, rather than using your own principal.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>An investor&rsquo;s mindset is like that of an entrepreneur: always extremely optimistic, always facing the sunshine; the market will eventually rise.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Teacher James analogizes the investor&rsquo;s mindset to Elon Musk&rsquo;s optimism when facing potential bankruptcy, emphasizing the importance of belief for long-term investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your mental health is superior to potential profit. If there is a wonderful medicine (elixir), but taking it causes fatal side effects, do you take it or not? Of course, you don&rsquo;t take it!
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Commenting on a student who felt extreme anxiety due to leveraged investing, the teacher emphasized that psychological endurance is the key to determining investment strategy, and one cannot sacrifice mental health for theoretical high returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humans were not born to work; humans are here to think about problems.
&ndash; Elon Musk (Quoted by Teacher James)</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Discussing the potential for mass unemployment caused by AI, Teacher James quoted this to suggest that human value lies in thinking, creation, and problem-solving, not repetitive labor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You go traveling, stay in nice hotels, you feel happy, and many thoughts become clear&hellip; It is worth spending this money, and we are not spending our own money; when I go to Taiwan, it&rsquo;s all borrowed money.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Answering Angela&rsquo;s question about feeling guilty spending money, the teacher explained the importance of enjoying life from psychological and health perspectives and introduced the concept of &ldquo;spending borrowed money&rdquo; to alleviate psychological burden.</p>

<p>Context: Responding to questions about social anxiety triggered by the AI era, Teacher James used historical analogies to comfort everyone, explaining that disruptions brought by technological progress always seem scary at the time but always push human society forward in the long run.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who are retiring are actually looking for a balance: do you want a larger cash flow, or do you want a larger inheritance?
&ndash; Ling</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Discussing high-dividend products like QQQI, Ling shared her decision-making process with her family, pointing out a very core trade-off point in retirement planning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you pledge in Singapore and borrow SGD, the interest rate is about 2.1%. But in Asia, very few of you understand borrowing money to invest in the Nasdaq 100 Index, so money becomes very cheap. This is the opportunity.
&ndash; Ling &amp; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Comparing borrowing rate differences between the US and Singapore/Asia, revealing that due to information asymmetry and different investment philosophies, the cost of funds in parts of Asia is extremely low, creating huge opportunities for investors who know how to use financial tools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you understand what &lsquo;government&rsquo; is, you will know whether you want to pay more taxes.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Discussing tax issues, the teacher hinted at a critical view of government efficiency and wealth redistribution, advocating that investors should engage in reasonable tax avoidance within legal limits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Taxes are planned. The fact that the money you earn is taxed is actually a good thing because you have a profit. Pay what you owe, and your heart will be at peace.
&ndash; Student &amp; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Discussing high dividend taxes, combining the views of the student and teacher, emphasizing the need for reasonable tax planning while also maintaining a positive attitude toward unavoidable tax burdens, as they represent investment success.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The financial industries in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore are very strong. Friends in these three regions should seize this; the ships are sturdy and the cannons sharp, and the bullets are free!
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: After comparing the financial environments of the West and Asia, the teacher highly praised the low-cost credit and stock pledging tools available to retail investors in these three regions, encouraging local investors to use them boldly.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Problem &amp; Harm</strong>: Teacher James had long been troubled by snoring problems and later realized their severity. Snoring (Sleep Apnea) leads to reduced blood oxygen concentration at night (he personally dropped as low as 83%). Long-term effects can trigger health risks such as insulin resistance, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, and even dementia.</li>
<li><strong>Treatment Plan</strong>: Through a dentist specializing in sleep therapy (Dr. Hsu at Caipin Dental Clinic), he underwent corrective treatment using a customized oral appliance (mouthpiece). The cost was about 50,000 to 60,000 TWD. This method does not require surgery and is suitable for moderate-level problems.</li>
<li><strong>Significant Results</strong>: After treatment, sleep quality improved drastically, and snoring almost completely disappeared. Comparing data from the <code>SnoreLab</code> App and <code>Apple Watch</code>: before treatment, snoring time accounted for 17% of sleep time with frequent awakenings; after treatment, the snoring ratio dropped to 0-1%, with continuous and deep sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Advice</strong>: The teacher suggests that friends with similar troubles take this issue seriously. You can use apps like <code>SnoreLab</code> for preliminary detection and consult professional sleep specialists; dental correction might be a relatively simple initial solution.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Core Warning</strong>: Teacher James, in a very serious tone, emphasized again that <strong>Non-US tax residents (those without US citizenship or Green Card) must absolutely not open accounts with US brokerages (such as Schwab, IBKR, Fidelity, etc.) to invest or buy real estate in their personal names.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Three Core Risks</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>High Estate Tax</strong>: Once the asset owner passes away, their assets in the US will face an estate tax of up to 40%.</li>
<li><strong>Account Freezing Risk</strong>: US financial regulation is very strict, and accounts can be frozen at any time for various reasons. For example:
<ul>
<li>The bank cannot contact the person (emails bounced, phone numbers invalid).</li>
<li>The actual flow of funds in the account does not match the purpose declared at opening (e.g., large investment sums moving in and out of an account declared for living expenses).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Extremely Complex Inheritance Procedures</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The inheritance process is cumbersome, requiring a large number of documents like death certificates and household registers, which need notarization and English translation, and finally authentication by the US Consulate in the local area.</li>
<li>Inheritance requires going through the US court&rsquo;s &ldquo;Probate&rdquo; process, taking at least six months or more.</li>
<li>Heirs usually need to hire US lawyers to handle it, which is costly and complex, potentially leading family members to give up inheritance, resulting in the assets vanishing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is absolutely no need to take this risk. Investors should buy ETF products tracking the Nasdaq 100 Index through local brokerages in their own country or region.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dividend Source Structure</strong>: QQQI&rsquo;s dividends do not rely entirely on profit distributions from constituent companies. Its composition is relatively complex and stable, coming mainly from three aspects:
<ol>
<li><strong>Actual Dividends</strong>: Dividends distributed by the 80% QQQ it holds.</li>
<li><strong>Option Strategy Income</strong>: Income (premiums) generated by selling Covered Calls and Call Spreads. This part of the income is usually correlated with central bank interest rate levels.</li>
<li><strong>Rebalancing &amp; Stabilization Fund</strong>: When the held QQQ appreciates significantly due to market rise, fund managers will sell a portion of the stocks to convert profits into cash, used to distribute dividends stably, acting similarly to a stabilization fund.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Purpose &amp; Trade-off</strong>: The goal of QQQI is to provide investors with stable, predictable cash flow. To achieve this, it sacrifices some capital appreciation (since it only holds 80% of QQQ, its Beta is about 0.8). Its total return will be slightly lower than QQQ, but for retirees who need stable living expenses, this is worth it.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rebalancing After Asset Appreciation</strong>: When assets using the 433 allocation grow significantly (e.g., from $1 million to $5 million), the &ldquo;autopilot system&rdquo; can be reset to improve quality of life.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Assets at 5 million, existing loan at 250k. You can take 500k (twice the loan amount) from the 5 million and put it into a Money Market Fund as a new cash reserve. The remaining 4.5 million is then allocated via 433. This way, annual disposable living expenses can be calculated at 2% of the new total asset value, i.e., $100,000 (5M * 2%), significantly improving quality of life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Core Principle of Stock Pledging: Borrow But Do Not Repay</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Wrong Operation</strong>: <strong>Absolutely do not use your cash reserves (Money Market Fund) to repay the stock pledge loan.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reason</strong>: Once you use cash to repay, your asset allocation ratio is destroyed. The reduction in the cash portion causes the risk (Beta) of the entire portfolio to rise from the original 0.9 to 1.11, significantly increasing volatility and violating the original intention of asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Mindset</strong>: People who pledge stocks should &ldquo;ignore interest.&rdquo; Because the interest generated by your cash portion (e.g., 3%) and the returns generated by the investment portion (e.g., 15%) are far higher than the loan interest you pay (e.g., 6-7%). The core function of cash reserves is for rebalancing during market downturns, not for repayment.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: After retirement, there are still individual stocks with high profits accounting for about ten-plus percent of total assets (such as Tesla, Google, Microsoft) in the account. How should they be handled?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: There are two options.
<ol>
<li><strong>Sell Immediately</strong>: Sell it all at once and pay the 15% long-term capital gains tax. The advantage is it&rsquo;s simple and done once and for all.</li>
<li><strong>Sell in Batches</strong>: Wait until the Roth Conversion is fully completed in 7-8 years. When personal income decreases, sell stocks in batches annually utilizing the tax-free allowance for long-term capital gains (about $60,000 for singles, deducting Social Security and other income) to save on taxes. But this method is more troublesome. The teacher leans towards the first option for simplicity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Due to high taxes and health insurance payments after retirement, annual expenses have increased, causing total assets to be slightly lower than 33 times annual expenses. Can stock pledging still be done?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: Absolutely. You can still borrow via pledging to pay taxes and living expenses. If the required withdrawal ratio is higher than the standard 2% of the 433 allocation, you can adjust the asset allocation appropriately. For example, increase the proportion of high-dividend QQQI in the retirement account. QQQI will generate stable cash flow to replenish your cash pool, which effectively lowers the risk (Beta) of the entire portfolio, thereby allowing you to safely increase the borrowing ratio (e.g., up to 3%).</li>

<li><strong>Share</strong>: After learning investment concepts, her mindset underwent a huge shift. She no longer bargains when buying things but feels grateful to merchants, practicing the mindset of a &ldquo;rich person.&rdquo; She started teaching her children to save from a young age and invest in 00662 (Nasdaq 100 ETF in Taiwan stocks), using incentives to encourage them to save. She also shared her experience of spreading these concepts to friends, realizing that everyone&rsquo;s timing for &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo; is different, but insisting on planting seeds always brings hope.

He explained the three types: obstructive, central, and mixed, emphasized long-term harms (such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s), and introduced different treatment methods, including oral appliances, CPAP machines, surgery, etc. He advised people with symptoms to see a doctor.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Comment</strong>: Thanks to Dr. Henry for the professional addition, and emphasized again that everyone should take this issue seriously and seek professional medical help.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong> (Asked by Su): A friend used a CPAP machine for a year and the problem was solved, but recently the doctor asked him to use it again. Why?
<ul>
<li><strong>Dr. Henry&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: CPAP is assisted breathing and usually cannot cure the disease itself unless the problem was caused by obesity and weight loss was successful. If weight rebounds, the problem may recur. If symptoms persist, continuous use or other treatment options like surgery are needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong> (Asked by Houqin): If surgery is needed, what specific part is treated?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: (Answering briefly on behalf) Generally, it involves removing excess soft tissue in the throat to widen the airway. However, the specific situation is very professional, and it is recommended to consult a specialist directly.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: As a new investor from mainland China, with total assets of about 700k RMB dispersed across IB, domestic brokerages, and HSBC Hong Kong. Since the asset amount is small, is asset allocation necessary? How should the leverage part be operated?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Account Adjustment</strong>: You should transfer assets from IB to HSBC Hong Kong as soon as possible to avoid US estate tax and account risks.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation</strong>: You can buy the Nasdaq 100 2x Leveraged ETF listed in Hong Kong via HSBC, but the leveraged position should not exceed 20% of total assets. Before starting to pledge for living expenses, there is no need to frequently rebalance the leverage part.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Position</strong>: For the cash part in the Hong Kong account, you can consult HSBC to see which money market funds (such as CSOP US Dollar Money Market Fund, 9096 or 3096) are eligible for pledging.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: Since the investment portfolio (QQQ, QLD, Cash) itself generates dividends and interest, and these cash flows might already be enough for living, why not use this money directly instead of borrowing and paying interest?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: This is a core conceptual error. <strong>Absolutely do not spend your own money (including dividends and interest)!</strong> Your money is a &ldquo;Golden Goose&rdquo; that can generate money and should be continuously invested in the market to obtain an annualized return of about 15%. The cost of borrowing is only 6-7%. Spending your own dividends is equivalent to giving up higher returns, which is not cost-effective at all.</li>

<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: After entering the AI society, with a large population unemployed, how will they consume without income? How will society function?

A large unemployed population will be &ldquo;kept/fed&rdquo; (like in a zoo), with basic food, clothing, housing, and transportation guaranteed by surplus products created by AI, but they will have no right to choose. Capitalists who own assets (us investors) can use wealth to buy scarce resources and services, living a life of free choice.

<li><strong>Question/Observation</strong>: Regarding the Nasdaq 100 Index constituent adjustment, why was Walmart (WMT) added recently, while AstraZeneca (AZN), whose market cap is far larger than the last company, was removed? Does this mean the index is no longer passive investment?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: This is indeed unusual. According to passive index rules, the company with the smallest market cap is usually removed. Removing a company with a high market cap ranking might involve human judgment, which contradicts the concept of a passive index. The teacher stated that further research into the specific reasons is needed, but this does not affect our long-term confidence in the index.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Investing makes you wealthy, but borrowing makes you a tycoon.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When answering student Lily&rsquo;s question about &ldquo;what he would say to his younger self if he could go back,&rdquo; the teacher emphasized the huge amplifying effect of using leverage early on for wealth growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have stock pledging, don&rsquo;t spend a single dime of your own assets. Why spend your own money? Your money can be invested for a 15% return, while borrowing only costs you 6% or 7%.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: In response to student Houqin&rsquo;s question about &ldquo;why not live off dividends instead of borrowing,&rdquo; the teacher hit the nail on the head regarding the opportunity cost of spending dividends, which is the core logic of the stock pledging strategy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not borrowing is where the risk lies; borrowing is actually lower risk.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Re-emphasizing that borrowing (pledging) under reasonable allocation carries lower risk than using principal (including dividends), because the latter destroys asset allocation and increases portfolio volatility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We rely on the 100 strongest companies in the US; there is no investment more stable than this.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When commenting on student Laurence&rsquo;s share, the teacher explained the source of confidence in investing in the Nasdaq 100 Index: trusting the long-term creativity of the top tier of human enterprises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are not a US tax resident; do not open an account with a US brokerage to invest, and do not buy assets in the US. Understood?
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: The teacher used an extremely serious and repetitive tone to emphasize the severe risks of direct investment in the US for non-US residents. This is an important reminder for all overseas investors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, after putting all my funds into QQQ with these asset allocations, I have &lsquo;done what had to be done, subject to no further becoming&rsquo; (所作已办，不受后有). That is, there will be no more troubles of greed, anger, and ignorance following me.
&ndash; Lily</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Lily shared her understanding of the teacher&rsquo;s &ldquo;Formless Investment&rdquo; philosophy, combining it with the Buddhist state of liberation from afflictions, vividly describing the inner peace brought by index investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We humans are not born to work&hellip; slowly let money work for us, so we can retire with stability and live what we call freedom.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: The teacher encouraged the student couple, explaining that the true meaning of financial freedom is liberating time and life to do what one truly wants, rather than being burdened by work for a lifetime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I am old, when I become a grandmother&hellip; I want to be a rich grandma.
&ndash; Shu</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Shu shared her beautiful vision for the future, hoping that through investment, she will not only make herself wealthy but also benefit her descendants, becoming a generous elder with financial confidence.</p>

<p>This episode, ranging from personal health to global macroeconomics, from practical investment to philosophy of life, once again builds a complete and firm investment worldview for us. Teacher James&rsquo; core message remains consistent: find and stick to the simplest and most essential investment truth—<strong>long-term holding and complete trust in index funds composed of top enterprises.</strong> He not only provided the methodology of &ldquo;what to do&rdquo; (buy indices) and &ldquo;how to do it&rdquo; (asset allocation and pledging) but, more importantly, by repeatedly emphasizing the investment risks for non-US residents and the importance of mindset construction, he cleared the most dangerous traps and common ideological obstacles on our investment path. Whether new investors or senior students, everyone can find the guidance and confidence needed for their current stage in this episode, eventually walking towards the path of financial freedom with peace of mind.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Power of Positive Intention</strong>: Teacher James opened by emphasizing that our lives and the world are created by our thoughts (brainwaves). One must say positive things to oneself daily, such as &ldquo;I am the best,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am rich,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am happy.&rdquo; By irrigating the subconscious, we attract positive energy, thereby transforming the external environment into what we desire. This applies not only to investing but to life as a whole.</li>
<li><strong>No-Brainer Investing</strong>: Investing in index funds should adopt a &ldquo;no-brainer investment method,&rdquo; ignoring short-term market turbulence, international situations, economic analysis, and financial reports. Admitting one&rsquo;s &ldquo;incompetence&rdquo; in predicting the market allows one to easily obtain long-term market returns.</li>
<li><strong>Information Channels</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Given the excessive ads in some YouTube videos (like 00451), it is suggested that students switch to <strong>Podcast</strong> or <strong>Himalaya</strong> platforms for listening.</li>
<li>A friend from China (Tree Kevin/Da Shu Kevin) has migrated the audio content to Himalaya, making it convenient for students in mainland China to listen.</li>

<li><strong>Major Update to Backtesting Tool</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Logic Modification</strong>: When calculating the maintenance ratio, the backtesting tool has changed the data benchmark from the previous &ldquo;<strong>monthly closing price</strong>&rdquo; to the &ldquo;<strong>monthly lowest price</strong>.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Reason for Modification</strong>: In the actual market, asset prices may hit a low point mid-month (e.g., on the 8th or 15th), triggering a Margin Call (liquidation), without waiting for the month-end close. Therefore, using the lowest price for backtesting aligns better with realistic risks.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Asset Allocation</strong>: This change does not affect the 80/20 allocation in Taiwan, but it impacts <strong>US market asset allocation</strong>. The previous 2.0x leverage (pledge loan accounting for 20% of total assets) would fail in worst-case scenarios and <strong>needs to be lowered to 1.9x</strong> (i.e., borrowing a maximum of $19,000 against $100,000 in assets).</li>
<li><strong>Tool Access and Usage</strong>: New tool instructions, engine explanations, and GitHub source code links have been provided. Users in mainland China who cannot access Vercel can download the source code via GitHub and use it offline in a local Docker environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rebalancing Strategy Details</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart Rebalancing</strong>: Switching between Cash and QLD.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Rebalancing</strong>: Divided into two scenarios.
<ol>
<li><strong>Insufficient Cash</strong>: During a decline, transfer a portion of QQQ to QLD without consuming cash.</li>
<li><strong>Sufficient Cash</strong>: Further divided into two modes:
<ul>
<li><strong>Defensive</strong>: Buy with cash when the market falls; switch between Cash and QLD when the market rises.</li>
<li><strong>Aggressive</strong>: Buy with cash when the market falls; when the market rises, sell QLD and convert directly to QQQ instead of cash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cash Management Strategy</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Teacher James personally holds <strong>almost zero cash</strong>. Daily expenses are covered by pledge loans borrowed only when needed (e.g., the day before credit card payments).</li>
<li>Idle cash should be invested in cash-equivalent assets, such as US BOX (BIL/SGOV/SHV) or Taiwan&rsquo;s 00865B, and sold only when money is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Critique of Insurance</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The teacher believes that buying insurance is a form of laziness and inertia, an attempt to transfer risk to insurance companies. He refers to insurance companies as &ldquo;<strong>poverty manufacturing machines</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>viruses of society</strong>,&rdquo; considering the financial industry to be &ldquo;licensed scam groups&rdquo; that investors should not rely on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Asset and ETF Information</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-US Assets</strong>: Provided XNAS, CNDX, EQAC, EQQQ, etc., as references, which may not be subject to US estate tax.</li>
<li><strong>Hong Kong High-Dividend Alternatives</strong>: 3451 or 9451 can serve as alternatives to QQQI; 3416 can also be considered.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: As a young person in Japan, if I use a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) and credit to invest in a Japanese Nasdaq 100 index fund, what should I do if the Yen appreciates significantly later (e.g., from 157 to 100)?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: Absolutely no problem. Your income is in Yen, and your loan is in Yen. As long as your salary is sufficient to cover the monthly loan payments, there is no need to worry. Stock and exchange rate fluctuations are irrelevant to you because you do not need to sell stocks to repay the debt. Even if there is a 30% loss in exchange rates, two years of stock market gains will be enough to cover it, so there is no need for concern.</li>

<li><strong>Share 1</strong>: Regarding purchasing Nasdaq funds in Hong Kong to avoid US estate tax, he summarized from personal experience that iShares <strong>2834</strong> is the best choice. It is registered in Hong Kong and adopts a dividend reinvestment strategy (has never paid dividends since listing in 2016), effectively avoiding CRS tax issues. In contrast, KQQM carries estate tax risks, and 3086 pays dividends which trigger CRS reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Share 2</strong>: He has helped many Clubhouse students gratuitously by sharing information on Hong Kong investments.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: He has an undeveloped idea: Can he take a portion of assets to buy QQQI to cover all living expenses with its dividends, then put all remaining assets into QQQ (2834), keeping no cash, and handling emergencies via pledge loans?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: No. This approach is very high risk. Apart from QQQI, the other portion of growth assets <strong>still needs to maintain a cash position</strong> (e.g., a 70% QQQ + 30% Cash allocation). There are two reasons: 1. Psychological stability; having cash prevents panic when the market drops 80%. 2. Dealing with emergencies. If a large sum of money is suddenly needed while the market is falling, taking out a pledge loan at that time is very dangerous. Without a cash buffer, you might be forced to sell assets at a low point or face the risk of liquidation. Keeping 30% cash, whether to use directly or as backing for a pledge, is much safer.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: Plans to move to Las Vegas (no state tax) after retirement. Her current state has a 6.8% state tax. Considering the federal tax rate might rise from 35% to 37% after retirement, should she do a Roth Conversion now or wait until after moving?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: <strong>Convert as early as possible.</strong> Because money in the IRA will continue to grow; 100k not converted this year might become 120k next year, increasing both the total amount to convert and the tax due in the future. The state tax saved by waiting is far less than the future tax burden brought by asset growth within the account. Additionally, it is suggested she sell her current car, take the cash to Las Vegas, and buy a new Tesla with a loan, allowing the cash to be used for investment.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: <strong>You must fix the house up before you can sell it quickly.</strong> Especially for major flaws like leaks; no one wants to buy without repairs. Selling a house is not about selling for a &ldquo;high price,&rdquo; but being able to &ldquo;sell it.&rdquo; The price is determined by the market, not the seller. Repairs should be done immediately, and it should be sold upon receiving the first reasonable offer, because the time cost of delay is high. That money can create more returns once invested in the market sooner.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: Due to business needs, he borrowed a high-interest (11-12%) Margin Loan from a brokerage. He went to Schwab to switch to a lower-interest Pledge Loan (PAL) but was told he could only choose one. However, the financial specialist helped him significantly lower the Margin rate to &ldquo;Federal Rate + 2.25%&rdquo; (approx. 6%). He asks, in this situation, is it better to use the high-flexibility but high-risk Margin Loan, or apply for PAL?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: This is correct information. Margin Loans come from brokers, PALs come from Bankers; the risk mechanisms differ. A Margin Call can happen instantly and sell at the lowest point, whereas PAL has a certain buffer time. Money borrowed via Margin can be reinvested in stocks, while PAL funds usually cannot. Therefore, Margin is more flexible but also carries higher risk.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: He runs his own business and has 100k TWD in monthly passive rental income, basically covering living expenses and mortgage. He just obtained a 5 million TWD credit line (interest approx. 2.5%) in Taiwan and applied for a 200k USD loan in Singapore (also approx. 2.5%, but with the condition of purchasing the bank&rsquo;s wealth management products). How should he use these funds? Put a lump sum into QQQ/QQQI, or invest in his own business?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: 1. <strong>Do not take the Singapore loan</strong>, avoid any loan that comes with conditions to buy their wealth management products. 2. The 5 million TWD credit should be <strong>fully invested in the stock market (e.g., 00662)</strong> and absolutely not invested in your own business, to diversify risk and avoid putting all eggs in one basket. 3. The prerequisite for borrowing is that repayment must come from stable business cash flow, not the already occupied rental income. 4. As a young person in the asset accumulation phase, you should invest in <strong>growth assets (00662)</strong>, not dividend-paying types like QQQI.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: <strong>Young people in the asset accumulation phase must absolutely not touch high-dividend products like QQQI.</strong> Your goal is to pursue maximized growth. QQQI is prepared for retirees who need cash flow.</li>

<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Her family is afraid of QQQ volatility and feels safer with QQQI&rsquo;s monthly dividends. What should she do?

<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: If the money belongs to the family and investing in QQQI is the only way they can accept, then so be it. At least it&rsquo;s better than not investing, though it&rsquo;s not the optimal strategy. QQQI&rsquo;s own volatility (Beta 1.0) is as high as QQQ.</li>

<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: Does QQQI have tax issues in Taiwan?

He explains in detail how to use high-dividend products (such as QQQI) and traditional index portfolios to achieve this goal, and updates the asset allocation simulation tool, sharing simulation results for investors in Taiwan and the US. Additionally, the content covers cash management and ETF selection options for non-US tax residents in mainland China, Hong Kong, and elsewhere. The Q&amp;amp;A session delves into hot topics such as financial education for children, stock pledging strategies, and local investment practices.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<lite-youtube videoid="FwPUUYWLGdE" playlabel="FwPUUYWLGdE" params=""></lite-youtube>

<p>The core theme of this episode is <strong>&ldquo;Redefining the Retirement Threshold.&rdquo;</strong> Teacher James overturns the traditional notion that one needs assets equal to 50 times their annual expenses to retire. Instead, he proposes a more positive and feasible plan: <strong>Retirement is possible with assets equal to just 15 times your annual expenses.</strong> The core of this plan lies in cleverly combining the stable cash flow provided by high-dividend ETFs with the appreciation potential of growth-oriented index investing. This significantly lowers the financial threshold for retirement, opening up the possibility of early retirement for more people. At the same time, the course updates the practical asset allocation simulation tool and provides specific investment tool recommendations for investors in different regions.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Strategy</strong>: Divide assets equivalent to 15 times annual expenses into two parts:
<ol>
<li><strong>10x Annual Expenses</strong>: Invest in high-dividend products to generate an annualized dividend of approximately 12% as stable cash flow to cover living expenses.</li>
<li><strong>5x Annual Expenses</strong>: Invest in a growth-oriented investment portfolio (such as the 433 allocation) to allow assets to continue growing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>High-Dividend Tool Recommendations</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>USA</strong>: QQQI, with an annualized dividend yield of about 12%.</li>
<li><strong>Taiwan</strong>: Can purchase QQQI via sub-brokerage (复委托).</li>
<li><strong>China</strong>: CSOP Huatai-PineBridge CSI Dividend Low Volatility ETF (008163).</li>
<li><strong>Hong Kong</strong>: Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (3416.HK), currently with a dividend yield as high as 16%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advantages</strong>: This plan makes retirement goals feel less distant, as investors don&rsquo;t need to wait until they accumulate 30 or 50 times their annual expenses. Fund managers handle the professional operations (such as selling stocks or utilizing options to generate income), providing investors with stable cash flow and shielding them from the direct psychological impact of market volatility.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tool Update</strong>: Teacher James and Martin updated the asset allocation simulator, fixed bugs, and released a 3-hour YouTube tutorial video explaining in detail how to use the tool.</li>
<li><strong>Simulation Conclusions (Based on 167% Maintenance Requirement)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Taiwan Investors (433 Allocation, Pledging Rate 3%)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Can withdraw a maximum of <strong>2.5%</strong> for living expenses annually without margin calls (liquidation).</li>
<li><strong>Special Reminder</strong>: Must consider the ~15% exchange rate fluctuation between TWD and USD. This affects the maintenance rate by about 10%, so using a 167% maintenance requirement is safer than 140%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>US Investors (Pledging LTV ~80%)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Can withdraw a maximum of <strong>2.1%</strong> for living expenses annually.</li>
<li><strong>Safety Recommendation</strong>: To leave a margin of safety (moat), it is suggested that Taiwan investors withdraw around 2.2%, and US investors withdraw 1.8%-1.9%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Non-Pledgers (80/20 Allocation)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Can withdraw <strong>2.7%</strong> annually, but the total asset value will barely grow, meaning they cannot enjoy the compounding effect of asset appreciation.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Q1</strong>: My family is well-off. How can I provide correct financial education to my young children to prevent them from developing bad spending habits?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Distinguish Consumption Types</strong>: Teach children from a young age to distinguish between &ldquo;spiritual consumption&rdquo; (e.g., travel, experiences) and &ldquo;material consumption&rdquo; (e.g., toys, brand names). Encourage the former, moderate the latter.</li>
<li><strong>Define Ownership</strong>: Clearly tell children that the money belongs to the parents, not them. Parents have the right to decide whether to meet their material demands. Do not let them take things for granted.</li>
<li><strong>Example is Better than Precept</strong>: Parents&rsquo; own spending habits are the best role model. If parents are thrifty and do not pursue material comparison (e.g., a car is fine as long as it drives; no need to chase the latest model), children will naturally be influenced.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q2</strong>: For Taiwan investors, QQQI tax refunds are delayed. Are there other local similar high-dividend funds as alternatives?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: I haven&rsquo;t specifically researched local funds in Taiwan. If you want to compare, you need to look at a few key indicators: 1. <strong>Max Drawdown</strong>, especially performance during the 2022 bear market; 2. <strong>Total Return</strong>, which is the sum of capital gains plus dividends. Compare these with QQQI to see which suits your needs better.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Share 1</strong>: His middle school child spends all pocket money on game points, refuses to save, and even half-jokingly called his father &ldquo;shabby&rdquo; (stingy).
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Do Not Reward Grades with Money</strong>: Studying is the child&rsquo;s own responsibility. Using money as an incentive may distort their values.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Improper Speech Immediately</strong>: When a child says disrespectful words like &ldquo;shabby,&rdquo; you must correct them immediately and seriously. Make them understand that this is the parents&rsquo; money, and they have no right to judge it like that. Some jokes are not to be made. You must set clear boundaries and rules for the child.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Share 2</strong>: Discussing recent social cases, lamenting the difficulty of raising children.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: Once children become adults, parents&rsquo; responsibility is limited; all the home can provide is a bed and a pair of chopsticks. The key is to set the rules well from a young age. If parents themselves have correct consumption concepts and are not wasteful, they can set a good example for their children.</li>

<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: For non-US residents, handling inheritance procedures through US brokerages is extremely complex and expensive. I strongly suggest you open an account in Hong Kong (e.g., HSBC) and directly buy ETFs listed in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has no estate tax, and there are corresponding Nasdaq 100 indices and leveraged ETFs, which completely avoids this problem.</li>

<li><strong>Q1</strong>: As a Taiwanese working in the mainland, how to safely transfer funds back to Taiwan after exceeding the annual foreign exchange quota of $50,000 USD for RMB income?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: This is a difficult problem; I don&rsquo;t have a perfect solution. Apart from carrying cash personally, official channels are indeed limited. Operating through company accounts is also very complex and requires trusted relationships.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Q2</strong>: For RMB that cannot be brought back to Taiwan for the time being, should I buy short-term products like government bonds or invest directly in Chinese index funds (like 513100)?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: Directly investing in index funds is also a good choice. Since the funds cannot be moved out for now, it is better to let them continue to appreciate in the local market. There is always a possibility that China&rsquo;s foreign exchange controls will loosen in the future.</li>

<li><strong>Q3</strong>: Should I put all assets (including the cash portion) into the pledge account to keep them &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: I do not recommend doing this. You should keep a portion of assets in a regular account to maintain flexibility. In case of brokerage policy changes (e.g., increased interest rates, account freezes), you have other assets as bargaining chips or emergency funds, so you won&rsquo;t be completely passive.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: Don&rsquo;t worry. The brokerage will give you a 1099-R tax form, and the system will calculate it automatically when filing taxes. Even if there is a small penalty, the interest rate is very low, equivalent to borrowing money from the government for a year at a very low cost, which is completely acceptable.</li>

<li><strong>Q1</strong>: Teacher suggests retirees with insufficient assets buy high-dividend products, but the total return of such products is lower than indices, and paying dividends is essentially selling assets. Why not just sell QQQ based on needs yourself?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: Mainly three points: 1. <strong>Overcoming Human Weakness</strong>: Operating it yourself makes you susceptible to market emotions, chasing highs and selling lows. Fund managers can execute strategies more rationally. 2. <strong>Providing Downside Protection</strong>: For example, in 2022, QQQ fell nearly 40%, while QQQI only fell about 30%. 3. <strong>Unique Income Source</strong>: QQQI earns extra premiums (about 4-5%) by selling covered call options, which is a stable cash flow source difficult for ordinary investors to replicate, ensuring dividends can be paid even in a bear market.</li>

<li><strong>Q</strong>: Regarding pledging, assuming annual expenses are 600k, pledging 3 million (5x) in the first year. In the second year, a total of 1.2 million is needed. Do I need to pledge another 3 million, or how does it work? Do I need to repay the principal after the 18-month loan?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: In the second year, the total debt is 1.2 million. You need to ensure the total market value of the assets pledged inside is maintained at 6 million (5 times 1.2 million). You can check how much the 3 million pledged in the first year has appreciated (e.g., to 4 million), and then just make up the difference (pledge another 2 million). There is no need to repay the principal after the loan expires; just pay the interest and handle the &ldquo;renewal,&rdquo; provided the maintenance rate is higher than the bank&rsquo;s minimum requirement (recommended above 167%).</li>

<li><strong>Share 2 (Important Correction)</strong>: Buying the <strong>Invesco-issued Nasdaq ETF (3455.HK)</strong> at HSBC Hong Kong <strong>still carries US Estate Tax risks</strong> because it is considered a product issued by a US company.

<p>The core of this session is the introduction of a new portfolio backtesting simulation App, used to deeply analyze and compare the differences between <strong>stock pledging</strong> and <strong>non-pledging</strong> retirement withdrawal strategies. Through live demonstrations, Teacher James shows the maximum safe withdrawal rates (approx. 1.5%-1.8%) and risks of pledging strategies under different markets (Taiwan vs. US), interest rates, and LTV (Loan-to-Value) ratios. The core takeaway is: while pledging can significantly increase total terminal assets over the long term, it demands extremely high cash flow stability and very conservative withdrawal rates. Conversely, non-pledging strategies allow for a higher withdrawal rate (approx. 2.7%) but sacrifice asset growth for greater flexibility.</p>

<li><strong>Ignore Market Noise</strong>: Teacher James began by emphasizing that daily market fluctuations, international tensions, central bank rate changes, economic data, and financial reports are irrelevant to our long-term investment strategy. Investors should focus on holding for the long term and moving forward.</li>
<li><strong>The Logic Behind Choosing QQQ</strong>: We invest in indices like QQQ not by &ldquo;looking in the rearview mirror&rdquo; at past performance, but based on a belief in the future—<strong>belief in human growth, technological progress, and the development of the United States.</strong> QQQ is the purest representation of these three beliefs.</li>

<p>Developed by community member Martin, this App simulates long-term returns and risks under various asset allocations, pledging conditions, and withdrawal strategies.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Taiwan Scenario (40% QQQ, 30% QLD, 30% Cash)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parameters</strong>: Initial principal of 1 million, 3% interest rate, 60% LTV.</li>
<li><strong>Withdrawal Testing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Annual withdrawal of 1.5% (15,000): Results show assets survive safely from 2000 to 2025.</li>
<li>Annual withdrawal of 1.6% (16,000): Results show the portfolio is liquidated (fails) in 2009.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Under Taiwan&rsquo;s pledging conditions, the upper limit for a safe withdrawal rate is very strict at <strong>1.5%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>US Scenario (40% QQQ, 30% QLD, 30% Cash)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parameters</strong>: 6.5% interest rate, higher LTV (70% for QQQ, 95% for Cash, but QLD cannot be pledged).</li>
<li><strong>Withdrawal Testing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Annual withdrawal of 1.8%: Safely survives.</li>
<li>Annual withdrawal of 1.9%: Results in failure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Due to more relaxed LTV conditions in the US, the safe withdrawal rate can reach <strong>1.8%</strong>, showing slightly higher risk tolerance than in Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Interest Rates</strong>: When Teacher James lowered the US interest rate to 5% (the setting used in early Excel simulations), the safe withdrawal rate rose to <strong>2.1%</strong>, proving that interest rates are a critical variable in pledging safety.</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Non-Pledging Strategy (80% QQQ, 20% Cash)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximum Withdrawal Rate</strong>: <strong>2.7%</strong> of assets annually.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome</strong>: While it safely survives 25 years, by 2025, the total asset value has barely grown, returning to its 2000 initial level. This strategy sacrifices capital appreciation for higher immediate cash flow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Comparison at Equal Withdrawal Rates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assume both strategies withdraw only 1.5% (15,000) annually.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Pledger</strong>: Assets grow to 1.61 million by 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Pledger (Taiwan Plan)</strong>: Assets grow to 4.75 million by 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Given the same low expenses, the pledging strategy can result in several times more asset growth. Investors must weigh &ldquo;higher asset growth&rdquo; against &ldquo;higher current cash flow.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pledging Risks are High</strong>: A 1.5% withdrawal rate means your total assets must be 66 times your annual expenses, a high bar for most people.</li>
<li><strong>Combine with High-Dividend ETFs</strong>: Retirees might consider allocating a small portion (e.g., 10%-20%) to high-dividend products (like QYI) to generate stable cash flow, reducing the amount and pressure of pledged loans.</li>
<li><strong>For Those Still Working</strong>: You can experiment with pledging while continuing monthly contributions, which makes the outlook much more optimistic.</li>

<li>Shared a Taiwan-version &ldquo;Buy vs. Rent&rdquo; spreadsheet, proving with data that over the long term, those who rent and invest will end up with assets vastly exceeding those who buy, with the gap reaching the &ldquo;hundreds of millions&rdquo; level.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Comment</strong>: James adjusted the simulation interest rate from 6.5% down to 5% on the spot, showing that a 2.1% withdrawal rate then became viable. This confirmed that the interest rate is the key variable and validated Chen Feng&rsquo;s calculations in a lower-rate environment. James thanked him for the significant time spent creating tools and educating the community.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: When doing a Roth Conversion after retirement, if one does not use stock pledging, how should taxes be paid?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: There are two ways. One is paying with cash from your Brokerage Account, which is the best way as it maximizes the funds moved into the Roth. The second is having the broker withhold taxes during the conversion (e.g., convert 200k, withhold 20k for tax), but this reduces the principal entering the Roth.</li>

<li><strong>Q1</strong>: In worst-case simulations (like the year 2000), cash positions and debt get very close. Is this safe enough?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: Yes, the simulation result is a &ldquo;narrow escape.&rdquo; In an extreme market crash of 85%, the assets just barely avoid liquidation. This illustrates why the withdrawal rate cannot be higher—2% is the tipping point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q2</strong>: When markets crash and cash is tight, should one be more cautious with &ldquo;Smart Rebalancing,&rdquo; such as reducing or pausing cash injections?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: Excellent question. We are indeed exploring more conservative approaches. One principle: if your cash reserve is lower than 15 (or even 20) years of living expenses, you should not touch it for rebalancing. An alternative is to sell some QQQ to buy QLD for rebalancing instead of using cash, preserving your safety net.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q3</strong>: When should company-issued semiconductor stocks be sold? Given tax issues, is it worth waiting or using complex Exchange Funds?

<li><strong>James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: As long as you have held them for over a year, a fixed long-term capital gains tax applies, which is independent of your personal income. Don&rsquo;t wait; sell after one year to diversify risk early. Avoid complex financial products like Exchange Funds—simple is best.</li>

<p>This session, through a practical backtesting App, turned the abstract concept of stock pledging into something concrete. Teacher James not only demonstrated the tool but, more importantly, revealed the trade-offs between risk and reward in different strategies. Pledging can significantly amplify wealth but requires extreme discipline; non-pledging is more flexible and suits those with higher cash flow needs. Most movingly, the real stories of students—especially Wu Li Yun from a grassroots background and Min&rsquo;s hardworking girlfriend—vividly illustrated the core philosophy: &ldquo;Investing can change your destiny.&rdquo; This was not just a technical analysis class, but a deep exchange about hope, peace, and life awakening, reaffirming the community&rsquo;s belief in long-term holding and simple investing.</p>

<p>The core theme of this episode revolves around adhering to the &ldquo;buy and do not sell&rdquo; index investment discipline and applying it to financial decisions in real life. Teacher James emphasizes that investors should completely ignore all external noise such as market fluctuations, macroeconomics, and corporate earnings reports. He focuses on arguing that young people should prioritize increasing liquid assets rather than purchasing real estate, and shares how to solve housing and living cash flow problems by activating assets (such as selling a house to invest), thereby avoiding the trap of being &ldquo;house rich, cash poor&rdquo; (poor until only a room is left). In addition, the course delves into principles for the safe use of leverage and loans, and how to conduct robust asset allocation based on individual circumstances.</p>

<li><strong>Increase Liquid Assets First, Then Buy a House with Ease</strong>: One should first increase liquid assets through investment. When assets are substantial, buying a house is as simple as buying slippers, and one can even use stock pledging to borrow money for the purchase (&ldquo;empty-handed white wolf&rdquo; strategy) instead of draining one&rsquo;s own cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>A House is a &ldquo;Prison,&rdquo; Not an Asset</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Mindset Trap</strong>: Ordinary people buying a home for self-use is different from a developer&rsquo;s high-turnover business model. Living in it for decades locks up the asset completely, eventually leading to being &ldquo;poor until only a room is left.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty in Liquidation</strong>: Even if the house price rises, it cannot be easily liquidated for living expenses. Transaction costs are high (taxes, agency fees), and the turnover rate is extremely slow.</li>

<li><strong>Solution</strong>: Sell the $1 million house.
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1 (Solve Housing)</strong>: Take $300,000 and invest in high-dividend products (like QQQYI, 12% annualized yield), generating $36,000 in cash flow annually, sufficient to pay a monthly rent of $3,000. The remaining $700,000 can be used for investment and living.</li>

<li><strong>Temporarily Closing New Memberships</strong>: To let the community return to its original intention of helping newcomers and to improve discussion quality, it was decided to temporarily close new member joins and reorganize internally.</li>

<li>Question: A new student of two weeks in Taiwan, currently investing in high-dividend and market-cap ETFs (ratio 3:2). Has a mortgage but enough funds to pay it off. To retire within 10 years, considering a &ldquo;financial mortgage&rdquo; (interest-only, 7-10 year term) to cash out more funds for investment. Worried that the 10-year loan term is shorter than the 15-year &ldquo;guaranteed profit&rdquo; cycle mentioned by the teacher. If the market drops 85% at maturity and the bank pulls funding leading to bankruptcy, how to resolve this?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Do not recommend financial mortgages</strong>: This type of short-term loan with non-renewal risk is very dangerous. Once unemployed or if the market falls for a long time, you face bankruptcy risk.</li>
<li><strong>Suggest Traditional Mortgage</strong>: Suggest converting the mortgage to a 30-year principal and interest repayment loan. Extend the term as much as possible to lower monthly payments, thereby releasing more cash flow for investment.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Allocation Suggestion</strong>: For funds of 6 million TWD, start with a robust allocation, such as 70% 00662 (tracking Nasdaq 100) and 30% 00865B (Short-term Treasury/Cash). Do not rush into leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Gradually Adapt to Leverage</strong>: Since she previously invested in high-dividend products, her volatility tolerance is unknown. Suggests starting with a 10% position if trying leveraged funds (like 00670L) to personally experience the feeling of a 30%-60% market drop, then adjust gradually.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Sufficient Cash</strong>: Must reserve 2-3 years of living expenses as cash. Overall, a 6:1:3 (60% Market Cap, 10% Leverage, 30% Cash) allocation is a suitable starting point for now.</li>

<li>Question 1: Father has dizziness issues, similar to what the teacher once shared about his own father (carotid artery issue). Asking for the contact of the doctor who performed the stent procedure for the teacher&rsquo;s father.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is experience sharing, not medical advice. He pointed out that such issues should consult &ldquo;Cardiovascular Surgery&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cardiology,&rdquo; not the intuitive &ldquo;Neurology.&rdquo; He found Dr. <strong>Shih Chun-che</strong> (Cardiovascular Surgery) at Taipei Medical University, and the surgery was performed by his brother, Superintendent <strong>Shih Chun-min</strong>, at Wan Fang Hospital. Suggests consulting relevant departments at large teaching hospitals (e.g., NTU, Veterans General, Chang Gung).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: How to educate the next generation (4 years old)? He told his child he doesn&rsquo;t like his job as an engineer and encourages the child to learn arts (piano, dance) or become a dentist, hoping the child won&rsquo;t become a &ldquo;laborer&rdquo; like him and fall into class reproduction.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Correcting &ldquo;Laborer Thinking&rdquo;</strong>: The teacher pointed out sharply that the father&rsquo;s educational method is essentially still &ldquo;laborer thinking&rdquo; because he links interests directly to &ldquo;finding a job that won&rsquo;t be replaced&rdquo; and income.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Should Not equate to Income</strong>: The core of education is guiding children to explore and find what they truly love and want to do as soon as they wake up, not for making a living. Things you like don&rsquo;t necessarily have to have a salary.</li>
<li><strong>Parents are the Backup</strong>: The parents&rsquo; responsibility is to be the safety net during the child&rsquo;s life adventure, providing basic food and shelter.</li>
<li><strong>Cultivate Independence</strong>: After adulthood, children must learn to be responsible for their extra desires (like new phones, travel) and earn money to satisfy them.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Guidance</strong>: Parents should take children to experience the world, not instill concepts of &ldquo;what job is good/bad,&rdquo; and definitely not pass on their own negative emotions about work.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:

<li><strong>Taxes</strong>: She remains a US tax resident and only needs to file US taxes as usual. Since there is no income in Taiwan, Taiwan tax is not involved.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Non-US tax residents buying through US brokers will have 30% tax withheld on dividends, discounting actual returns. Although theoretically one can apply for a tax refund, the process is extremely tedious. He suggests checking if the Hong Kong broker offers services to apply for refunds on your behalf. Meanwhile, he recommended a Mainland China OTC high-dividend fund, <strong>Southern Dividend Low Volatility 50 ETF (Code 008163)</strong>, with an annualized yield of about 10%, as a local alternative.</li>

<li>Question: Why recommend investing in QQQ (Nasdaq 100) instead of S&amp;P 500? Isn&rsquo;t QQQ more volatile?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Because QQQ has a higher long-term return rate. A portfolio of 500 companies is too diversified, affecting overall performance; 100 companies are diversified enough. For &ldquo;buy and hold&rdquo; investors, volatility during the process is not risk and can be completely ignored. Whenever there is money, one should buy.</li>

<li>Question 1: Misunderstood stock pledging. She thought her 4:3:3 combination (400k QQQ, 300k QLD, 300k Cash) allowed her to borrow $540k based on the broker&rsquo;s limit, asking how to use this money.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is an extremely dangerous misunderstanding. Borrowing such a high ratio means immediate bankruptcy if the market drops 80%. <strong>The principle of safe pledging is: borrow at most 2% of total assets annually.</strong> For $1 million in assets, the safe borrowing limit is only $20,000 per year for consumption or reinvestment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: For a retired person, if the 30% cash is only enough for 10 years of living expenses, and part of it is spent when the market falls, is there extra money to &ldquo;buy the dip&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>Non-retirees should not live off investment principal.</li>
<li>For retirees, ideal cash reserves should cover <strong>15 years</strong> of expenses (corresponding to total assets being 50 times annual expenses). If cash only covers 10 years, it means total assets are insufficient to support a leveraged configuration like 4:3:3, and high-dividend ETFs should be added to supplement cash flow.</li>
<li>The 15 years of living expenses used for safety <strong>must never</strong> be used to buy the dip, as this is for survival. Only &ldquo;extra&rdquo; cash beyond 15 years of expenses can be considered for investment during market drops.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is the reality of the financial services industry. The first step in financial management is to stay away from financial advisors and insurance agents.

<li>Question 1: If one has a separate stable cash reserve, can the investment portfolio be allocated as 60% QQQ and 40% QLD?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You cannot view the investment portfolio in isolation like this. You must calculate the ratio with all assets (including that &ldquo;separate&rdquo; cash) together. For example, if total assets are 1.4 million (of which 400k is cash), then a 700k QQQ and 300k QLD allocation is actually <strong>50% QQQ : 21% QLD : 29% Cash</strong>. This 5:2:3 ratio is reasonable because the leveraged fund (21%) does not exceed cash (29%) or the prototype fund (50%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: In the long run, is QLD&rsquo;s return guaranteed to be better than QQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>Absolutely not.</strong> After a deep bear market, leveraged funds may take decades to recover, while QQQ recovers much faster. The purpose of holding leveraged funds is to harvest profits into QQQ or cash through &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; during bull markets; it is not an asset to be held mindlessly forever. If the position becomes too high, it must be adjusted <strong>immediately</strong>; you cannot wait even one day.</li>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t buy a house quickly, prices will keep rising, and you won&rsquo;t be able to afford it later&hellip; Only by understanding the principles of capitalism and increasing your liquid assets first will buying a house become as simple as buying slippers.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: The teacher criticizing the prevalent &ldquo;home-buying anxiety&rdquo; in society and proposing that after achieving financial freedom through investment, purchasing a home will no longer be a difficult problem.</p>
<blockquote>

&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Describing the ultimate dilemma of ordinary people treating real estate as their only major asset—the asset is locked up and cannot generate cash flow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In front of the market, we must admit that we know nothing&hellip; If you think you know, then you are too overconfident.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Emphasizing that the primary mindset for successful investment is humility, admitting the inability to predict the market, thereby avoiding wrong decisions due to overconfidence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can solve (the housing problem) with $300,000, why use $1 million, $2 million, or even $3 million assets to solve it?

<p>We parents are their backup&hellip; at least they have a bed to sleep in and food to eat during their adventure process.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Elaborating on the role of parents in children&rsquo;s education, which is providing security and encouraging children to bravely explore their own life paths.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leveraged funds&hellip; when they rise, you must move the earned money to cash or QQQ, otherwise the money you made is in vain, and eventually, one drop will send you back to pre-liberation days.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Explaining that leveraged funds cannot be held stubbornly for the long term; profits must be locked in through rebalancing, otherwise floating gains accumulated will vanish rapidly in a bear market and be hard to recover.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first step in financial management is to avoid financial management&hellip; you need to stay away from financial advisors.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Commenting on the financial services industry, reminding students of the importance of self-learning and mastering their own financial destiny to avoid being exploited by professionals charging high management fees.</p>

<p>This episode began with a warning about community scams, reinforcing the cornerstones of CLEC investment philosophy—discipline and mindset. Through a profound analysis of the concept of &ldquo;real estate,&rdquo; which is deeply rooted in Chinese society, Teacher James guided everyone to step out of traditional thinking frameworks, truly understand the value of &ldquo;liquid assets,&rdquo; and provided concrete and feasible asset activation plans. The Q&amp;A session covered multiple levels from asset allocation, leverage use, tax planning to children&rsquo;s education. The teacher&rsquo;s replies not only offered operational advice but also conveyed the underlying philosophy of life and risk management thoughts. The entire sharing session warns us that true financial freedom stems from correct cognition, strict discipline, and reverence for risk, rather than chasing or predicting the market.</p>

The core idea is &amp;#39;survival first, profit later,&amp;#39; meaning long-term returns are contingent on being able to withstand market volatility without being liquidated. This session highlights QQQI as a retirement cash flow tool and delves into the concept of real estate as a consumer good rather than an investment.

<p>This session focuses on <strong>the mindset and actions investors should adopt amidst optimistic market expectations</strong>. The core idea is that the market is on the verge of a significant rally, and investors should enter decisively without hesitation. Teacher James emphasizes that the key to successful investing is <strong>&ldquo;survival first, profit later.&rdquo;</strong> Only by staying in the market for the long term and enduring all volatility can one ultimately enjoy the rich rewards of compounding. Therefore, constructing an asset allocation that allows you to weather any storm is crucial.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market Outlook &amp; Capital Flow</strong>: The market is poised for a breakout to new highs. A strong rally is expected in December. An important backdrop is that QT (Quantitative Tightening) ended on December 1st. The central bank will now inject about $15 billion into the market weekly, totaling around $50 billion per month. This will create a massive capital flow, driving the market upward.</li>
<li><strong>The First Principle of Investing: Survive</strong>:
<ul>
<li>An annualized return of 15% is predicated on being able to stay invested for over 30 years without being liquidated due to fear or excessive leverage. If you exit midway, even the highest returns are irrelevant to you.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s better to choose a stable asset allocation that can survive any risk, even if the annualized return is only 7%. The key is to survive for 30 years or even longer.</li>
<li>The core of investing is <strong>doing the right thing</strong>. Regardless of the market&rsquo;s current state, you should always be buying. Be happy when it goes up, and don&rsquo;t panic when it goes down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Coping with Market Sentiment</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The principle of &ldquo;be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy&rdquo; is hard to execute. The simplest way to practice it is to <strong>resolutely not sell</strong>.</li>
<li>Investors need to admit that they &ldquo;know nothing&rdquo; and cannot predict market highs or lows. This allows them to respect the market and hold for the long term.</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s channel teaches only one thing: buy bravely and consistently, never sell, and you will succeed.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: To provide a new option for retirees who need a stable cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Ticker Introduction</strong>: QQQI (Nasdaq-100 Enhanced Opt &amp; Growth ETF).</li>
<li><strong>Features &amp; Advantages</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>High Dividend</strong>: The dividend yield can reach 12%. For example, an investment of $1 million can generate $120,000 in cash flow per year ($10,000 per month); an investment of $5 million can yield $600,000 per year ($50,000 per month).</li>
<li><strong>Lowers the Retirement Threshold</strong>: For retirees who haven&rsquo;t prepared 25-30 times their annual expenses, investing just 8-10 times their annual expenses in QQQI can generate enough cash flow to cover living costs.</li>
<li><strong>Operational &amp; Tax Advantages</strong>: QQQI distributes dividends derived from a portion of capital gains (from selling appreciated stocks) and income from selling covered call options (about 4-5% annually). For Taiwanese investors using a brokerage with QI (Qualified Intermediary) status (like E.Sun, Yuanta, Cathay, SinoPac, etc.), most of the dividend income, being sourced from capital gains, is eligible for a tax refund. Approximately 96% of the dividends can be refunded.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Act Decisively</strong>: Investors who are still hesitating and haven&rsquo;t entered the market should stop &ldquo;daydreaming.&rdquo; Be &ldquo;ruthless&rdquo; in your actions—immediately sell what you shouldn&rsquo;t hold, buy the correct asset allocation, and then &ldquo;get on the bus and go to sleep.&rdquo; Financial freedom won&rsquo;t be far off.</li>
<li><strong>A House is a Consumer Good, Not an Investment</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve reached a level of wealth where &ldquo;buying a house is like buying a pair of slippers,&rdquo; then buying a luxury home to enjoy life is perfectly fine.</li>
<li>But beware of becoming &ldquo;high-income but exquisitely poor,&rdquo; where your cash flow is extremely tight just to maintain a lavish home. This is akin to buying yourself a giant &ldquo;cage.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>The Correct Sequence</strong>: You should invest first and let your money make money. For example, <strong>if you have $1 million now, first invest it to grow into $200 million, and only then take out $100 million to buy a house.</strong> This way, you can truly enjoy the pleasure of living without being shackled by your property.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Subconscious and Manifestation</strong>: It is recommended to watch a video in the presentation notes that teaches how to connect your subconscious with universal energy. The core principle is to &ldquo;believe&rdquo; first, then meditate in a state of peace, happiness, and love, which makes it easier to manifest your desires.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fraud Prevention</strong>: A reminder that there are many impersonators and scams on Clubhouse and other platforms. Scammer IDs (like <code>clecchman</code>) are very similar to the teacher&rsquo;s ID (<code>clecchirman</code>) and use GPT to mimic his tone in private messages. Please be sure to verify by checking follower counts (the teacher has 4.3K followers) and other means.</li>
<li><strong>Book Commentary</strong>: Mentioned that &ldquo;Dr. Huang Pei-Yuan&rsquo;s Bible of Financial Management&rdquo; is a good book, but its sequel, &ldquo;Financial EQ,&rdquo; was likely a cash grab by the publisher with mostly filler content. Reading the first book is sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>Canadian Tax Update</strong>:
<ul>
<li>2025: 50% of capital gains will be included in the year&rsquo;s income.</li>
<li>Starting 2026: For capital gains exceeding C$250,000, 67% of the excess amount will be included in the year&rsquo;s income.</li>
<li>As long as you don&rsquo;t sell, no capital gains tax will be incurred.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing:
<ol>
<li><strong>Regarding QQQI Tax Refund</strong>: Taiwanese investors need to confirm if their brokerage has &ldquo;QI status.&rdquo; If so, they can get a tax refund on their QQQI investment. The method may vary; some brokerages don&rsquo;t withhold tax upfront, while others withhold and then refund it. Most medium to large brokerages have QI status.</li>
<li><strong>The Ease and Persistence of Investing</strong>: Any diligent investment method can make money, but Teacher James&rsquo;s method is the most effortless and worry-free. However, &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, and never sell&rdquo; is easier said than done. It requires personally experiencing severe market volatility (like in 2022) to truly test one&rsquo;s mentality.</li>

<li>Question: With the development of AI, will countries like Vietnam and Indonesia lose the opportunity to transition from labor-intensive to tech-based economies, as Taiwan and South Korea did, and thus be permanently locked at the bottom of the value chain?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This issue is more severe than imagined. The impact of AI is global, not just limited to developing countries. Taiwan&rsquo;s semiconductor industry could also be replaced by fully automated AI factories. The future society will be divided into a tiny minority of capitalists (about 0.1%) and a vast majority of ordinary people (99.9%) dependent on social welfare. The only way out is to become a capitalist—get on board (invest) as soon as possible to enjoy the dividends of this technological revolution. Otherwise, everyone could be left behind by the times.</li>

<li>Question: I am 45, my father has cancer. After selling a house, we have NT$8 million in cash, but annual expenses are NT$1.1 million. I want to take out a NT$6 million loan against my mortgage-free house to invest in QQQI, using the cash flow to support my father. I also hope my father will invest, but it&rsquo;s hard to convince him. What is your advice?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You are very filial, but you don&rsquo;t need to worry excessively about your father&rsquo;s finances. Right now, <strong>companionship and care are far more important to your father than investment advice.</strong> You should spend more time with him and cherish this period. You can use the NT$6 million loan to invest for yourself, and the returns can be used to support your mother in the future. You don&rsquo;t need to spend excessively on talent classes for your children; playing with them is the best education.</li>

<li>Question 1: I have initial capital and a monthly salary. Should I DCA monthly, or accumulate for a year and then rebalance according to the 433 strategy?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Buy whenever you have money each month. Don&rsquo;t wait a year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Using the 433 allocation, what should I do with the money borrowed from a stock pledge if I don&rsquo;t need it immediately?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>(Extremely Important Warning!)</strong> If you are in the United States, money borrowed from a pledge <strong>absolutely cannot</strong> be put back into a securities account. The fund flow must be clearly for consumption. A friend has already been asked by Schwab to close their pledge account for this reason, or face a forced sale of stocks to repay the loan. The consequences are severe. If you are not in the US, this amount (at most 2% of assets borrowed annually) is small, so reinvesting it won&rsquo;t have a major impact.</li>

<li>Sharing:
<ol>
<li><strong>Stocks vs. Real Estate</strong>: After some thought, she concluded that stocks grow through compounding, while real estate&rsquo;s advantage is leverage. However, due to the growth rate difference between stocks (~10%) and real estate (~6%), plus loan interest, the leverage advantage of real estate is depleted after about 7-8 years. After that, the growth curve of stocks will far surpass that of real estate.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Management in China</strong>: In the Chinese stock market, unused cash can earn interest through &ldquo;government bond reverse repos,&rdquo; which can be selected on a daily basis and are very flexible. The interest rates can sometimes be very high before public holidays.</li>

<li>Question:
<ol>
<li>Which Nasdaq-100 ETF should I invest in in China?</li>
<li>My personal financial situation is very good, and I hope to maximize long-term returns. How should I allocate my assets?</li>
<li>My current small brokerage in the US charges commissions as high as 1.5-2%. Should I move to Schwab?</li>
<li>How can I join the LINE group?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>The 159509 she bought before is a technology fund, not a Nasdaq-100 index. It&rsquo;s recommended to choose the tickers we suggest.</li>
<li>Since you can tolerate high volatility, you can use a very aggressive allocation: <strong>85% QQQ + 10% QLD + 5% TQQQ</strong>, and rebalance once a year.</li>
<li><strong>Transfer immediately!</strong> Your brokerage&rsquo;s fees are extremely high and it&rsquo;s not safe. Schwab is the best choice—it&rsquo;s secure and commission-free.</li>
<li>The LINE group has regional restrictions; US numbers might not be able to join, but you can try.</li>

<li>Question: I just arrived in the US. The best option in my 401K is an S&amp;P 500 fund. My Roth IRA is allocated to QLD, and I have cash (in BOX) in my personal brokerage account. In the long run, the proportion of the S&amp;P 500 will become too high. How should I adjust?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your setup is fine. Max out your 401K with the S&amp;P 500 and max out your Roth IRA with QLD. In your personal brokerage account, keep six months of living expenses in BOX (don&rsquo;t buy SGOV, as the dividends are taxable), and invest the rest of the funds <strong>entirely in QQQ</strong>.</li>

<ol>
<li>Sharing: From mainland China, he just discovered the channel last week and felt a sense of &ldquo;sudden enlightenment,&rdquo; with hope for his future. He and his wife had followed the traditional path of buying a house and taking on a mortgage, leading to immense pressure. After listening to the teacher&rsquo;s classes, his mindset completely changed. He no longer frets over grievances at work because he knows he will be wealthy in the future.</li>
<li>Question 1: I have a mortgage (covered by the Housing Provident Fund) and a personal loan. How should I handle them?</li>
<li>Question 2: I have 100,000 RMB available for investment (after setting aside six months of living expenses). Should I allocate it as 80% index / 20% cash?</li>
<li>Question 3: I&rsquo;ve opened a Schwab account and plan to open an account in Hong Kong in the future for pledging. Is this plan feasible?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>Continue to use the Provident Fund for the mortgage. For the personal loan, don&rsquo;t rush to pay off the principal; just pay the interest and use it as a revolving line of credit.</li>
<li>Yes, apply an 80/20 allocation to all your investable assets. The 20% cash can be put into a money market fund.</li>
<li>The plan is excellent. Start transferring some funds to Hong Kong annually now. Once the capital reaches a certain size, you can start pledging. This is a correct ten-year plan. Also, don&rsquo;t be afraid to have a second child because of financial pressure. You will be very wealthy in the future, and having more children will make your family happier.</li>

<p>This quote emphasizes that the prerequisite for long-term investment success is the ability to withstand any market fluctuation without being forced out. Survival is the first element of profit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can buy a house like you buy a pair of slippers—just get another pair if you don&rsquo;t like them—then you can buy one. If you can&rsquo;t be that magnanimous, then a house is just a big cage.

<p>This quote vividly defines a house as a consumer good rather than an investment, advising people not to be shackled by property and become &ldquo;exquisitely poor.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only the capitalists can enjoy the greatest dividends of human transformation&hellip; otherwise, everyone will perish.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to the impact of AI on future social structures, the teacher points out that in the face of disruptive technological change, becoming a capitalist (an investor) is the only way out for ordinary people.</p>

<p>This session began with a very optimistic market forecast (end of QT, influx of capital) and reinforced CLEC&rsquo;s core investment philosophy: <strong>simple, persistent, and brave</strong>. Teacher James not only gave clear instructions—&ldquo;keep buying, don&rsquo;t sell&rdquo;—but also built a solid theoretical foundation from both psychological and strategic standpoints. Whether it was emphasizing the importance of &ldquo;survival,&rdquo; introducing the powerful retirement cash flow tool QQQI, or subverting the traditional concept that &ldquo;a house is a cage,&rdquo; the goal was to help investors establish a correct view of wealth, break free from anxiety, and embark on a relaxed yet firm path to financial freedom. The enthusiastic sharing and questions from the students also provided vivid interpretations and applications of these concepts in real-life situations.</p>

<p>The core of this class revolved around two key points: first, introducing the proper use of the high-dividend ETF <strong>QQQI</strong> for retirees and investors needing cash flow, emphasizing its role as a supplementary cash flow tool rather than a substitute for cash itself; second, through in-depth analysis, clarifying the common misconception about <strong>QQQ (Nasdaq 100 Index)</strong>, pointing out that its investment logic is to &ldquo;invest in the strongest companies of the moment,&rdquo; not limited to the &ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; sector. Teacher James used examples and a historical perspective to explain the dynamic adaptability of the index and reiterated the core investment philosophy of holding for the long term and ignoring market fluctuations.</p>

<li><strong>Market Irrelevance</strong>: Market volatility, international situations, economic data, and company earnings reports are all irrelevant to our investment decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Core Strategy</strong>: The only correct strategy is to &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, hold for the long term, and never sell.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Investment Target</strong>: Do not invest in individual stocks; focus on broad-market index funds to avoid the risks associated with individual company earnings and operations.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Awareness</strong>: The market can drop by 50% or even 80% at any time. Investors must manage their own risk and ensure that the funds invested are for the long term and will not be needed.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: QQQI is suitable for those who are retired or need a stable cash flow, especially when your annual expenses exceed 2.5% of your total assets.</li>
<li><strong>Functional Positioning</strong>: QQQI is a tool to <strong>generate cash flow</strong>, but it <strong>cannot be equated with cash</strong>. Your emergency fund should still be kept in highly liquid assets like money market funds (e.g., 00865B).</li>
<li><strong>Allocation Scenario</strong>: If your retirement assets are less than 40 times your annual expenses (i.e., your withdrawal rate is higher than 2.5%), you can pair it with a portion of QQQI to increase overall cash flow yield to meet living expenses. Young people or investors still in the accumulation phase should continue to invest in growth-oriented index funds like QQQ, 00662, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Practical Application</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In the United States, QQQI can be held in both retirement and individual accounts.</li>
<li>In Taiwan, you can purchase QQQI through a sub-brokerage (such as Yuanta, Fubon, Cathay). Most of the dividends distributed can be reclaimed through tax refunds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Case Study</strong>: A friend of the teacher followed his advice early on, sold his house, and went all-in on QQQ (00662). His assets grew by 1.5 times in five to six years, achieving financial freedom. He now enjoys a high-quality retired life. This stands in stark contrast to those who work their entire lives for a house, a car, and an insurance company.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dispelling the Misconception</strong>: Many believe that investing in QQQ is investing in &ldquo;American high-tech.&rdquo; This is not entirely accurate. Truly pure technology sector funds are like XLK or VGT, but we do not recommend investing in any sector-specific funds.</li>
<li><strong>The Essence of QQQ</strong>: QQQ invests in the <strong>100 strongest companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange</strong>. It is an index without a &ldquo;personality&rdquo;; its only criterion is &ldquo;strength.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Adaptability</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In the current era, the strongest companies happen to be mostly high-tech firms.</li>
<li>However, if we went back 40 years, the strongest companies might have been those making radios, televisions, or trains, and they would have been included in the index. The definition of &ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; changes with the times.</li>
<li>The index also includes companies like Costco and Starbucks, which are not high-tech but are extremely powerful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Core Viewpoint</strong>: We invest in QQQ because we believe that human progress is driven by these strongest companies. We are investing in a <strong>mechanism that dynamically selects the strongest players</strong>, not betting on a specific industry. Obsessing over whether it is a &ldquo;high-tech fund&rdquo; is pointless; what matters is its excellent long-term performance.</li>

<li>Sharing: Discussed the process of stock pledging at HSBC in Hong Kong. She found HSBC&rsquo;s loan-to-value ratios to be relatively conservative (70% for underlying stocks, 90% for cash, leveraged ETFs cannot be pledged), which is lower than in the US or Taiwan.</li>
<li>Question 1: She designed a low-risk allocation of 50% Nasdaq and 50% cash (Beta=0.5), with annual expenses accounting for about 3% of total assets. She wanted to confirm if this approach is safe and whether using the cash portion would create risk. Additionally, she heard that HSBC uses the entire account as collateral, rather than differentiating by asset type, and wanted to verify this.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: The pledging rules at HSBC Hong Kong are identical to those in the US. It&rsquo;s normal for leveraged funds to have no pledge value. She has two options: 1. If taxes are not a concern, she can build a 4-3-3 portfolio within HSBC, buying Hong Kong-listed leveraged ETFs and rebalancing. 2. To avoid domestic capital gains tax, she could, like other students, buy and sell leveraged ETFs through an overseas broker like IBKR, but she must be mindful of potential future US estate tax issues. The teacher emphasized that when you need money, you should &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; from your credit line, not &ldquo;sell assets.&rdquo; A single withdrawal should preferably not exceed 10% of total assets, and always ensure your cash position is greater than your total liabilities; this is very safe.</li>

<li>Question 2: She is helping her mother with financial management and, to give her mother a sense of involvement, is debating whether to open a Joint Account or manage it herself and provide regular updates.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: There are several options, depending on her mother&rsquo;s preference. They could open a joint account; she could open an account in her mother&rsquo;s name, and her mother could sign a Power of Attorney for her to operate it; or she could open it in her name and just share the login details so her mother can view it anytime. The simplest way is to show her the monthly statement and discuss the account&rsquo;s status together.</li>

It is not fixed. The teacher also demonstrated live how to use ChatGPT to calculate asset allocation ratios: by inputting the expected returns of different portfolios (e.g., 2.5% for a 4-3-3 portfolio, 11% for QQQI), the AI can help you calculate the capital proportions needed to achieve a target return rate (e.g., 4% or 6%).</li>

<li>Question: She is a citizen of mainland China but has accounts and funds in mainland China, Hong Kong (Standard Chartered Bank), and IBKR (opened previously in Canada). She feels her asset allocation is chaotic and doesn&rsquo;t know how to distribute it.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: First, as a Chinese tax resident, it is not advisable to keep large assets in IBKR due to the risk of US estate tax; the funds should be consolidated into a Hong Kong account as soon as possible. Second, it&rsquo;s important to distinguish between &ldquo;margin financing&rdquo; at mainland brokers (borrowing money to buy stocks, cash cannot be withdrawn) and &ldquo;stock pledging&rdquo; at Hong Kong banks (collateralizing stocks to borrow cash for spending). He advised her to keep about 1 year of living expenses in China, 2-3 years of cash in Hong Kong, and invest the majority of the remaining funds in the Nasdaq 100 index. She could allocate a small portion (e.g., 10%) to a 2x leveraged ETF since she is still young and not yet retired.</li>

<li>Question: She made an operational error during a trade.

She asked if she should hold these extra bonds and pay back the money later.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Absolutely not! In investing, once you make an operational mistake, you must correct it immediately and get back on your original planned track. You cannot let a mistake stand. This was an unplanned, passive borrowing act, which is wrong. She should sell the extra bonds as soon as possible and pay off the pledged loan.</li>

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes, you must adhere strictly. You absolutely cannot act based on short-term market fluctuations, or you will become a short-term trader. The discipline is to operate only once a year, pick a time (like December or January), get it done, and then you are finished until the next year.

<li>Question 2: She currently has an IBKR account in Canada. After opening an HSBC account, should she keep both accounts and operate them in parallel?

This &ldquo;leg&rdquo; is a &ldquo;lame leg&rdquo; that will need to be &ldquo;amputated&rdquo; sooner or later, so it&rsquo;s better to deal with it now.

She calculated that the future rent would be about the same as her current mortgage payment, but her living space would shrink to one-third of its original size.

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a matter of changing your perspective. By selling the house, you gain a large sum of cash to invest, which means your assets start working for you. A smaller living space means a simpler life, less cleaning, and you can spend your time and money on improving experiences. More importantly, this is a short-term &ldquo;sacrifice.&rdquo; Five or ten years from now, when your invested assets have doubled or grown, you can use the returns to rent a much larger and more luxurious place than the one you sold. This isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;enduring hardship&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s &ldquo;taking nourishment&rdquo; for the sake of exponential future freedom.</li>

<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This is typical nonsense. First, the source of the video is questionable; it&rsquo;s likely AI-generated.

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This is classic short-sightedness. The teacher did a 30-year calculation for him on the spot: assume he sells his house now and gets back 180,000 in principal, with the house valued at 300,000. In 30 years, at a 6% annualized growth rate, the house will be worth 1.7 million. But the 180,000 principal invested in QQQ, at a 15% annualized return, will become 12 million in 30 years. 1.7 million versus 12 million, which one do you choose?

<li>Question (from the comment section): My assets are less than 10 million, my monthly income is 120,000, and my expenses are 100,000, leaving me with a monthly cash flow of 20,000. Can I, as soon as I receive my 120,000 income each month, immediately buy 100,000 of 00865B and 20,000 of 00662, and then immediately pledge them to borrow 100,000?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: No! Absolutely do not do this. You can&rsquo;t possibly invest 100,000 and expect to borrow 100,000 back; the risk is extremely high. Moreover, your allocation is 80% bonds, which has a very low Beta and poor returns. It&rsquo;s not worth borrowing money for at all.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Selling your house isn&rsquo;t enduring hardship, it&rsquo;s taking nourishment! You&rsquo;ll understand in the future.
&ndash; James Chan
Context: In response to student Evelyn&rsquo;s psychological struggle about her living space shrinking and feeling a decline in quality of life after selling her house, Teacher James used this vivid metaphor to clarify that this is a short-term adjustment for massive future wealth growth, an act that nurtures the future.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to win at the starting line; we just need to win at the finish line.
&ndash; James Chan
Context: When answering a student&rsquo;s question about how to educate her 6-year-old child in Singapore&rsquo;s fiercely competitive environment, the teacher emphasized the importance of letting children grow up happily and discover their interests, opposing premature, &ldquo;involution&rdquo;-style education.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have money in the bank, the bank cares a lot about me. &hellip; I also owe the bank money, I owe them a lot. &hellip; (But) I&rsquo;m spending my equity.
&ndash; James Chan
Context: When discussing the relationship between property and banks with a student, the teacher clarified the correct relationship the wealthy have with banks: not as debtors passively repaying loans, but as asset owners actively using their assets (through pledging) to generate cash flow.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In investing, once you make an operational mistake, you must correct it immediately and get back on your original planned track. You cannot let a mistake stand.
&ndash; James Chan
Context: When instructing student Vicky on how to handle the mistake of buying too many bonds, the teacher stated unequivocally the only correct principle for dealing with errors.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You should listen to his philosophy, not his stock prices. If they ever talk about stock prices, that&rsquo;s nonsense.
&ndash; James Chan
Context: When commenting on the AI-generated &ldquo;Charlie Munger&rdquo; video circulating online, the teacher taught everyone how to selectively absorb information, focusing on learning the mindset and life wisdom of investment masters, rather than getting entangled in their (possibly fabricated) predictions of specific stock prices.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Teaching is the most profitable.
&ndash; Qing
Context: Student Qing shared his observation of some investment bloggers, noting that they themselves admit their most profitable business is running courses and memberships, not their own investing, which highlighted the selflessness of Teacher James&rsquo;s free sharing.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your money allows you to stay in high-quality hotels all over the world. &hellip; You really have to slowly learn to adjust your energy, to truly treasure yourself a bit more, to love yourself a bit more.
&ndash; Cherry
Context: Student Cherry shared her insights while traveling in Europe, encouraging everyone to use their wealth to experience the world and improve their quality of life, rather than being shackled by material possessions (like a house).</p></blockquote>

<p>This session was rich in content and highly practical. Teacher James not only clearly defined the applicable scope of the tool QQQI, helping those planning for retirement to better construct their cash flow, but also once again clarified the fundamental investment logic of QQQ, strengthening everyone&rsquo;s confidence in long-term holding. The Q&amp;A interaction was particularly brilliant, ranging from specific cross-border account management to profound analyses of investment psychology. The repeated debates on &ldquo;selling a house to invest&rdquo; were especially notable, where the teacher, through firm logic and highly persuasive metaphors, helped students overcome the fear and doubt associated with transitioning from traditional concepts to a modern investment mindset. The entire discussion emphasized the critical role of discipline, critical thinking, and a long-term perspective for investment success.</p>

<p>The theme of this episode focuses on <strong>&ldquo;True Freedom&rdquo;</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;An Investment Mindset that Ignores the Market.&rdquo;</strong> Teacher James emphasizes that market volatility (such as a 5% rise or fall) and international situations should be irrelevant to investors. True freedom is when daily life is no longer constrained by monetary considerations. Furthermore, as the end of the year approaches, students are reminded to perform &ldquo;Smart Rebalancing.&rdquo; The session also highlights the characteristics and use cases of high-dividend ETFs (such as QQQI, JEPQ) and deeply explores how AI technology is changing content creation and future lifestyles.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignoring Market Volatility</strong>: The market fluctuated by 10% over the past two weeks, but this should have zero impact on long-term index investors. If you can manage to be completely unaware of last week&rsquo;s market fluctuations, or even log into your account only once a year, you are a successful investor.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Freedom</strong>: The definition of freedom is &ldquo;money is not within your considerations.&rdquo; Whether dining out, traveling, or buying a house, being able to act as if you are buying a pair of slippers without considering the price—that is attaining the realm of freedom.</li>
<li><strong>Year-End Operations</strong>: It is currently November/December, which is a good time for <strong>Smart Rebalancing</strong>. If you don&rsquo;t want to do it now, doing it early next year is also fine.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>China 513100 Premium Issue</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Do not obsess over the premium. Due to foreign exchange controls, financial institutions cannot immediately arbitrage to close the gap, so the premium may exist for a long time (even 100 years).</li>
<li><strong>Strategy</strong>: Buy immediately at market price. Getting &ldquo;on the bus&rdquo; is what matters most; do not miss the market rally while waiting for the premium to converge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>High-Dividend ETF Analysis (JEPQ, QQQI)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: Those who have retired and need stable cash flow. <strong>Young people should not invest in this</strong>; they should focus on growth.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>JEPQ</strong>: Dividend yield approx. 10%, Beta approx. 0.7-0.8 (lower volatility).</li>
<li><strong>QQQI</strong>: Dividend yield approx. 12-13%, Beta approx. 0.9-1.1 (volatility close to QQQ).</li>
<li><strong>Major Holdings</strong>: These funds typically hold about 80% in QQQ and use the other 20% for options strategies (Covered Call, etc.) to generate cash flow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tax Issues</strong>:
<ul>
<li>US Tax Residents: Primarily treated as Long-term capital gains (preferential tax rate), not ordinary Income.</li>
<li>Taiwan/Overseas Investors: If the brokerage (e.g., SinoPac re-consignment, with IBKR as the upstream) has QI status, there may be an automatic Refund, allowing for full dividend receipt. Generally, non-US residents face 30% withholding, but products like QQQI may have higher refund ratios due to their structural characteristics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Risk Warning</strong>: These are not Cash (Money Market); they will still fall with the market (potentially dropping 20-30%) and risk must be considered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Leveraged Fund Risks</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Although leveraged funds (like TQQQ) won&rsquo;t go to zero, they can face a 99% decline.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Rebalancing</strong> must be executed: convert profits to cash during rises so you have funds to replenish positions during major market crashes (e.g., an 85% drop).</li>
<li>Leveraged positions must not exceed the prototype fund or cash positions.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Recently listened to a speech by Charlie Munger and learned about holding cash, understanding risk, antifragility, and not being jealous.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Munger always emphasized &ldquo;no leverage&rdquo; and &ldquo;no borrowing,&rdquo; but Buffett actually uses insurance float as leverage. Why did Munger advise this? Does it conflict with our concept of &ldquo;leveraged investing&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Munger opposed <strong>borrowing for consumption</strong> (e.g., Americans borrowing to buy mansions, luxury cars, paying for travel in installments), which leads to being &ldquo;exquisitely poor.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Munger opposed <strong>all-in, unhedged leveraged investment</strong> (like going all-in on Bitcoin or a single stock).</li>
<li>Our borrowing is based on <strong>asset allocation and risk control</strong>, which is completely different from the gambling-style borrowing Munger opposed.</li>
<li>Regarding jealousy: Never compare yourself with others; compare with yourself. Win at the finish line, not at the starting line. Be overflowing with confidence and ignore outside noise.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: My firm, which I ran for 15 years, is closing due to hiring difficulties. Although I have enough money, I feel I wasted my youth and feel sad. How do I adjust?</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Single, 50 years old, no children, assets approx. 35 million TWD, annual expenses 1.8 million. Previously advised a 3-1-6 allocation; can I now use 18 million to buy high-dividend ETFs (like 0056 or QQQI) and do a 70/30 allocation with the rest?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Regarding Asset Allocation</strong>: Since you have 35 million, taking 20 million to buy QQQI or 0056 generates over 2 million in cash flow annually, fully covering the 1.8 million expenses with surplus. Keep 5 million in cash and buy 00662 with the rest for long-term growth. You have plenty of money; enjoy it to the fullest.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Mindset</strong>: Closing the firm is a good thing; it ends the torture. Life doesn&rsquo;t require &ldquo;doing things&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s okay to contain &ldquo;idleness.&rdquo; Establish <strong>rituals</strong> in life (gardening, keeping fish, pour-over coffee, reading), enjoy freedom, and don&rsquo;t need work to prove your value.</li>
<li><strong>Special Advice</strong>: Single people need to build a close circle of friends who can &ldquo;go to the emergency room with you at 2 AM.&rdquo; This is very important.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: I have a retired client couple with few assets, living on Social Security. They own a large house worth about 6 million USD. The wife has an emotional attachment to &ldquo;home&rdquo; and refuses to sell, wanting to turn it into an Airbnb while they move back to Taiwan. Is this wise?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Very unwise. Keeping a big house (&ldquo;old hen&rdquo;) that doesn&rsquo;t lay eggs is not cost-effective. The maintenance costs (property tax, repairs) for a 6 million dollar house are extremely high.</li>
<li><strong>Advice</strong>: Sell the house, cash out 3-4 million USD, invest in QQQI, and generate 300,000-400,000 USD in annual cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: With this huge cash flow, they can rent the highest-end apartments (with pools, gyms, social events) anywhere in the world (including the US) and enjoy true freedom, instead of being an Airbnb landlord dealing with messes. Mindsets must change; don&rsquo;t be trapped by &ldquo;poor man&rsquo;s thinking.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Strongly support this. Even as a VP, you can &ldquo;work with one hand&rdquo;; being less busy actually improves efficiency.</li>
<li>Renting in the Bay Area ($4500-5000) gets you into luxury apartments with excellent facilities, offering a higher quality of life.</li>

<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The key is <strong>Freedom</strong>. If you don&rsquo;t dare to live somewhere because taxes are high (like California), that is not freedom. The goal should be to be unconstrained by money and location.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: My son bought a life insurance policy (Whole Life), paying $1000/month. He has paid 130k. Initially told he only needed to pay for 10 years, now the agent says he has to pay until age 100?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is <strong>garbage</strong>. I suggest stopping it (Cancel) immediately. Instead of paying $1000 to the insurance company every month, put it into QQQ. Savings/Whole Life insurance for young people usually has low returns, and eventually, even the principal might be eaten up by premiums.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Strongly agree. Children are independent individuals; studying isn&rsquo;t the only path.

<p>In this episode, Teacher James further deepened the core concept of &ldquo;Financial Freedom&rdquo;—achieving complete indifference to money and market fluctuations. On the practical side, detailed explanations of high-dividend tools like QQQI were provided for the retired demographic, along with a strong recommendation to sell inefficient real estate assets and switch to financial assets to obtain true freedom and cash flow. Regarding the tech horizon, the teacher depicted a future where AI Agents will replace traditional Apps and reminded everyone to use AI tools to improve efficiency. Finally, regarding family relationships, the importance of respecting independent individuals and emotional connections was emphasized, encouraging everyone to live a &ldquo;free life&rdquo; unbound by money.</p>

<p>The core message of this lecture is that <strong>&ldquo;The Key to Successful Investing is Inaction.&rdquo;</strong> Teacher James emphasizes that investors should minimize decision-making and ignore all market noise, such as economic data, international situations, and interest rate hikes or cuts, as these are irrelevant to long-term investing. The correct approach is to do nothing after buying quality assets. However, the prerequisite for &ldquo;inaction&rdquo; is a deep understanding of market risks. One must prepare for the worst-case scenario (e.g., an 85% asset decline lasting for ten years). Only through rigorous asset allocation and maintaining sufficient cash flow can one ensure survival in this prolonged test.</p>

<li><strong>The Fewer Decisions, the Better</strong>: In investing, the most successful strategy is to &ldquo;make no decisions.&rdquo; When the market panics and everyone is discussing various macroeconomic issues, the best response is to ignore them.</li>
<li><strong>The Core of Investing</strong>: The most important and difficult thing in investing is to &ldquo;stay put&rdquo; after buying, which requires immense discipline. Any attempt to operate, change, or predict the market is almost destined to lower final investment performance.</li>
<li><strong>Practicing &ldquo;Inaction&rdquo;</strong>: The core skill to practice in investing is &ldquo;inaction.&rdquo; Your feelings are worthless in the face of the market, even &ldquo;garbage.&rdquo; You must be emotionless to invest successfully.</li>

<li><strong>The Duality of the Market</strong>: In the long run, the market will inevitably hit new highs (there is no highest, only higher), which is a natural consequence of human societal development. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean the market won&rsquo;t fall.</li>
<li><strong>The Inevitability of Extreme Risk</strong>: In an investor&rsquo;s lifetime, they will inevitably encounter an extreme situation where the market drops 85% from its peak, and this downturn could last as long as ten years.</li>
<li><strong>Qualification for Investing</strong>: You are only truly qualified to invest when you can face an 85% drop in your assets without a rebound for ten years, still adhere to the principle of &ldquo;never sell,&rdquo; and live a normal life. If you cannot accept the decline, you should not invest.</li>
<li><strong>The Only Antidote to Risk</strong>: The only way to combat this extreme risk is <strong>asset allocation</strong>. You must assume the worst-case scenario will happen tomorrow and allocate your assets accordingly, ensuring you have enough cash (e.g., enough to live on for ten years) to get through the crisis.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He has recently been studying Charlie Munger&rsquo;s wisdom in depth and advises everyone to listen to the views of wise people rather than getting caught up in whether the market is at a high point. He believes that in a bull market, investors should examine their own capabilities and risk control to avoid excessive borrowing.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Charlie Munger repeatedly warns against using leverage and borrowing money to invest. This seems to differ from the channel&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;pledging assets for a loan to invest.&rdquo; How does the teacher view this difference?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: What Munger opposes is the kind of leverage that could cause you to <strong>lose your freedom or go bankrupt</strong>. For example, a property developer who bets everything and goes bankrupt due to soaring interest rates, or an ordinary person who takes out a loan for a luxury house beyond their means to save face, ending up trapped by the loan and losing the freedom to quit their job. Munger&rsquo;s core idea is &ldquo;don&rsquo;t lose your freedom because of debt.&rdquo; The borrowing we advocate is based on extremely strict risk control: you must be able to assume that the stock market could drop to zero and stay there for 15 years, and you would still be fine. Only then can you borrow that money. This requires investors to have adequate asset allocation and cash flow and is not suitable for those nearing retirement. Therefore, the core spirit of both views is consistent: emphasizing survival and freedom in the worst-case scenario.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He mentioned that a legislator in Taiwan is recently promoting an investment plan for infants aged 0-10, where the government and parents would each contribute 4,000 TWD/month into an ETF.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This direction is correct, but requiring parents to contribute places a huge burden on young families, which is a flaw. He suggested a better way would be for all listed companies to increase their capital by 1% annually, inject these shares into a &ldquo;Taiwan ETF pool,&rdquo; and then distribute them to newborns. This way, neither the government nor the parents have to pay; the capitalists invest in the country&rsquo;s future, which would face less resistance.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: He shared his transformation from an &ldquo;employee mindset&rdquo; to a &ldquo;capitalist mindset.&rdquo; In the past, society taught us to pursue high income, then buy a nice car and a nice house, but this is actually a trap that keeps you working for capitalists. He shared how he once sold a luxury car and invested the 2 million TWD into an index fund, a decision that became one of the best of his life.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: There&rsquo;s recent discussion in Taiwan about calculating the supplementary health insurance premium based on total annual dividend income. How does this affect investors in high-dividend ETFs like 0056? What are the teacher&rsquo;s suggestions?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: First, he criticized the unfairness of this tax system, as it specifically targets vulnerable groups who rely on dividends, while capital gains are not taxed. He believes all income should be taxed fairly. Second, he proposed a solution: where there&rsquo;s a policy, there&rsquo;s a countermeasure. If dividend taxes or premiums become too high, investors can consider investing in US-listed high-dividend ETFs, such as <strong>JEPQ</strong> or <strong>QQQI</strong>, through a &ldquo;sub-brokerage&rdquo; service. The income from these would be considered overseas income, which has a high tax exemption threshold in Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>Follow-up Discussion</strong>: A student pointed out that dividends from products like JEPQ purchased through a sub-brokerage might be subject to a 30% withholding tax, and some brokers (like Cathay) do not assist with tax refunds. Therefore, the teacher emphasized that before undertaking such an operation, one <strong>must</strong> confirm the tax policies with their broker. If the tax is withheld and cannot be refunded, it is not a suitable investment.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He started investing in 2021, experienced a 20-30% paper loss but held on, and has now not only recovered but also seen good returns. This has built his confidence in long-term investing. After discovering the teacher&rsquo;s channel, he felt a &ldquo;moment of enlightenment,&rdquo; as if freed from a hamster wheel, and his financial anxiety has significantly decreased. He also successfully shared this philosophy with his family, who have started buying 00662.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Helping those around you is great, but you must also know when to &ldquo;let go.&rdquo; For those who cannot be persuaded, don&rsquo;t force it. The core of investing is the spirit of &ldquo;holding on for dear life&rdquo;; inaction leads to wealth, while frequent trading can lead to nothing.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: He has seen families turn against each other over inheritance. He is puzzled why wealth can harm families and asked for the teacher&rsquo;s perspective on the phenomenon where the first generation strives, the second is harmonious, but by the third, disagreements and conflicts arise in wealth succession.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Property disputes usually happen when the heirs are in dire need of money. For them, any slight injustice is magnified. The most troublesome assets are illiquid ones like real estate. For elders who wish to distribute their assets according to their will, they must plan ahead while alive through <strong>trusts</strong> or <strong>gifts</strong>. Once a person passes away, everything can only be distributed according to the law. As children, the best approach is to follow legal procedures to avoid disputes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: He observed that even business owners work like laborers, constantly working and expanding. Others who are financially free dare not stop, feeling useless without work. Is this the result of capitalist indoctrination?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: As long as a person needs to go to work every day, even if it&rsquo;s their own company, they are still a &ldquo;laborer,&rdquo; and they even bear the risk of their own capital, which is a double risk. A true capitalist has no responsibilities and lets money work for them. This &ldquo;workaholic&rdquo; mindset is shaped by decades of education and work environment and is indeed hard to change. Munger also reminds us not to neglect family for the sake of making money, or you might win wealth but lose at life.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He shared the story of his 78-year-old American landlord. The landlord placed all 13 properties he built into a family trust, managed jointly by his descendants, to maintain family cohesion and wealth. He compared this model to the teacher&rsquo;s preferred QQQ model and marveled at how wise his decision was to sell his property and switch to QQQ, which has freed him from excitement or fear over market fluctuations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The landlord&rsquo;s approach was one of &ldquo;necessity.&rdquo; Holding a large amount of real estate presents problems like difficulty in division and high inheritance taxes. Setting up a trust for descendants to manage essentially turns them into &ldquo;laborers,&rdquo; bound by these properties for generations. If he had held QQQ, wealth succession would be much simpler, easily done through annual gifts, and his descendants wouldn&rsquo;t have to toil to manage the assets, allowing them to truly enjoy the freedom that wealth brings.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To succeed in investing, the fewer decisions you make, the better. Making no decision is the best decision.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: At the beginning, the teacher explained his core investment philosophy, emphasizing that in an environment of information overload and market volatility, maintaining &ldquo;inaction&rdquo; is the best path to success.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You must assume that the market will start falling tomorrow, that it will fall by 85%, and that it will last for 10 years. Only if you can still make your investments and asset allocations under this assumption&hellip; are you qualified to invest.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: When discussing risk control, the teacher proposed an extremely harsh psychological and financial test. Only investors who can pass this &ldquo;stress test&rdquo; are truly prepared.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Your feelings are garbage as far as the market is concerned. So in the market, don&rsquo;t talk about feelings. You should have no feelings to be able to invest.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The teacher sharply pointed out that investing is a rational domain, and any judgment based on personal feelings or emotions is worthless, or even has negative value, in the face of Mr. Market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In a capitalist society, everyone is educated to become a diligent laborer. The banks and the government essentially want to empty your pockets so you can work hard for the country.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The teacher offered a profound critique of the current socioeconomic system, arguing that it encourages people to become laborers who are then systematically &ldquo;harvested.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What Munger is talking about with borrowing is that you will lose your freedom&hellip; You must not lose your freedom because of borrowing, this is very important.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: In explaining Munger&rsquo;s opposition to leverage, the teacher grasped its core message—the biggest risk of leverage is not financial loss, but the potential loss of personal freedom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Saving is a very bad thing. So if you put your money in the bank, it gets thinner and thinner with inflation. How can you possibly become rich? It&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The teacher challenged conventional wisdom, pointing out that in an era of inflation, keeping money in a bank is tantamount to asset depreciation and is a major obstacle to wealth creation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As long as you need to get up and go to work every day, even if it&rsquo;s your own company, you are a laborer.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: When answering a student&rsquo;s question about whether a boss is a capitalist, the teacher gave a clear definition: a true capitalist makes money work for them, not the other way around.</p>

<p>This lecture, starting from the core investment philosophy of &ldquo;inaction,&rdquo; builds a complete system of investment thought. Teacher James not only emphasized the importance of long-term holding and ignoring noise but also spent a significant amount of time analyzing the most critical and often overlooked aspect of investing—risk awareness. He demanded that every investor confront the market&rsquo;s cruelest possibilities and build their investment portfolio based on that benchmark. In the Q&amp;A session, through in-depth interaction with students, the lecture&rsquo;s content was greatly enriched and deepened. Whether it was the interpretation of Munger&rsquo;s &ldquo;no borrowing&rdquo; wisdom, or discussions on wealth succession and tax planning, the session was full of practical guidance and thought-provoking philosophy. Ultimately, the lecture returned to a fundamental question: we invest and manage our finances to achieve true freedom, not to be enslaved by wealth.</p>
