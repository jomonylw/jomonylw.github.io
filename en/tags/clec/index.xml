<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Differences between CLEC Investment and Market Books, Influencers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Strategy:</strong> CLEC uses the NASDAQ 100 Index Fund (QQQ) as its core, combined with leveraged funds (QLD) and bank pledges for asset allocation, targeting an annualized return of 12%~20%.</li>
<li><strong>Traditional Investment Education:</strong> Usually only emphasizes large-cap index investing (such as VOO, SPY) or value investing, rarely mentions leveraged funds, and even less involves specific capital operation strategies (such as stock pledges).</li>
<li><strong>Influencer Finance:</strong> Often oversimplifies investing or recommends various immature investment targets (such as newly issued ETFs), lacking systematicity and risk control.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Freedom Strategy:</strong> CLEC provides a clear path to financial freedom, including when to start stock pledges, the amount that can be safely withdrawn each year, and how to achieve financial freedom through capital operations, rather than just &ldquo;saving money + investing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Practicality and Executability:</strong> CLEC provides concrete and actionable plans, such as how much assets you need to reach to start pledging, how to adjust asset allocation according to market conditions, while many books and courses only have theory and lack practical guidance.</li>
<li><strong>Capital Operation:</strong> CLEC emphasizes capital operation through bank credit, wealth management mortgages, stock pledges, etc., to achieve the goal of &ldquo;borrowing money to invest, borrowing money to spend, and asset appreciation,&rdquo; which is rarely involved in traditional investment education and influencer finance.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Emphasizes risk control and has specific coping methods in the event of a downturn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comparison with Common Investment Books:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;The Psychology of Money&rdquo;:</strong> Emphasizes long-term investing and saving, but CLEC goes a step further by accelerating wealth accumulation through leverage and capital operations.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&rdquo;:</strong> Advocates investing in the broad market index (SPY), but CLEC believes that QQQ has more growth potential and combines leveraged funds and cash for asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Buffett:</strong> Buffett is the representative of value investing, requiring in-depth research on companies and industries, while CLEC believes that ordinary people do not need to have professional knowledge and only need to invest in index funds.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&rdquo;:</strong> Focuses on real estate investment, while CLEC believes that stock investment and capital operations are more efficient and does not recommend investing in real estate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investor Growth Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beginner Stage:</strong> Learn and practice long-term investing principles, and don&rsquo;t panic and sell (already in the top 20% of the market).</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Stage:</strong> Learn and use leveraged funds and stock pledges (top 20% of the market).</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Stage:</strong> Proficient in stock pledges, cash flow management, and asset allocation, and fearless of market fluctuations (top 1% of the market).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Core Investment Philosophy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mission:</strong> To awaken the capital awareness of ordinary people and help them achieve financial freedom, rather than for traffic and making money.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Target:</strong> Focus on investing in QQQ, believing in the long-term development of American technology.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage Use:</strong> Reasonably use leveraged funds (QLD) to magnify returns, but strictly control risk and avoid short-term operations.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Rebalancing:</strong> According to market ups and downs, dynamically adjust between QQQ and cash (or short-term bonds) to achieve &ldquo;buy low and sell high.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledge:</strong> Obtain cash flow through stock pledge to achieve &ldquo;consuming without selling stocks&rdquo; and ensure continuous asset appreciation.</li>
<li><strong>Simple and Effective:</strong> The investment strategy is simple and easy to understand, can be executed in the long term, does not require monitoring the market, and does not require stock picking.</li>

<p><strong>Sharing:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A-share NASDAQ ETF Premium Issue:</strong> Elaborated in detail the fundamental reasons for the premium of domestic A-share NASDAQ ETFs (such as 513100, 159941, etc.):
<ul>
<li><strong>Foreign Exchange Control:</strong> China implements foreign exchange control, and each fund company has a state-approved quota. The quotas of old fund companies are usually tight, resulting in limited off-site subscriptions (suspension or limits), and investors can only turn to buying ETFs on the market, which pushes up on-site prices and forms a premium.</li>
<li><strong>Market Sentiment:</strong> The A-share market is easily affected by policies, hot spots, and other factors, and rapid capital flows can lead to violent fluctuations in the premium of the NASDAQ ETF. For example, when the market pursues other hot sectors, funds may withdraw from the NASDAQ ETF, leading to a decrease in the premium or even a discount.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Trends:</strong> In the long run, due to the existence of foreign exchange controls and investors&rsquo; continued optimism about the NASDAQ, the premium will exist for a long time. However, in the short term, the premium will be affected by market sentiment and capital flows.</li>
<li><strong>On-site and Off-site Differences:</strong> The same fund has different codes and trading methods on-site (exchange-traded funds, ETFs) and off-site (subscribed and redeemed through the fund company). Off-site subscriptions are usually based on the fund&rsquo;s net value, while on-site transaction prices are affected by supply and demand, which may result in premiums or discounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Investors:</strong> The premium of the A-share NASDAQ ETF is unfavorable to ordinary investors, especially buying at a higher premium, which increases the investment cost.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Recommendations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long-Term Investing:</strong> If it is a long-term investment, there is no need to worry too much about short-term premium fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Be Cautious When the Premium is Too High:</strong> When the premium is too high (such as exceeding 10%), you can wait appropriately or consider other investment channels.</li>
<li><strong>Pay Attention to Discount Opportunities:</strong> When a discount occurs, it is a good time to buy.</li>
<li><strong>Open an Account in Hong Kong:</strong> If conditions permit, you can consider opening an account in Hong Kong to directly purchase US stock QQQ, avoiding premium problems, and you can also allocate leveraged funds (QLD).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Comments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fully agrees with the doctor&rsquo;s analysis that the premium problem of A-share NASDAQ ETF is indeed caused by factors such as foreign exchange controls and market sentiment.</li>
<li>Suggests that investors who are more sensitive to premiums or want greater investment flexibility can consider opening an account in Hong Kong.</li>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> After Trump takes office again, will his domestic and foreign policies be very different from the past (including his first term), and will these changes shake the American system?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>American Strength:</strong> Clearly stated that the United States is very strong and Trump will make the United States stronger.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of Political Officials:</strong> American political officials are very good, they are loyal to the country, and can give up personal interests for national interests (for example, many political officials come from Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street investment banks, giving up high-paying positions).</li>
<li><strong>International Situation:</strong> Touched on international issues without commenting too much to avoid controversy.</li>
<li><strong>Ukraine Issue:</strong> Believes that the Ukraine issue was caused by Zelensky, who should be responsible for the current situation in Ukraine. Implies that Ukraine is being used by the United States.</li>
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> Overall optimistic about the United States and Trump&rsquo;s policies, believing that the United States will continue to remain strong.</li>

<li><strong>Awakening of Life:</strong> Emphasized the importance of awakening in life, realizing that you are not living for others but for yourself. Plan your life early and don&rsquo;t feel confused until retirement.</li>
<li><strong>Significance of Financial Freedom:</strong> Financial freedom is not only the accumulation of wealth, but also to obtain more time and freedom to pursue your life goals, to accompany your family, and to experience life.</li>

<li><strong>Definition of Capitalist:</strong> Redefined the concept of &ldquo;capitalist,&rdquo; pointing out that true capitalists are those who do not need to work themselves and can obtain wealth through capital operation.</li>

<li><strong>Question:</strong> For investors in mainland China who cannot purchase leveraged funds (QLD), is it possible to keep investing in QQQ at regular intervals? Is this method feasible?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Completely Feasible:</strong> For investors in mainland China, since they cannot purchase leveraged funds, the following strategies can be adopted:
<ul>
<li><strong>Office Workers:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Retain six months of emergency reserve funds (cash).</li>
<li>Invest all remaining funds in A-share NASDAQ ETFs (such as 513100, 159941, etc.).</li>
<li>Hold for the long term and invest regularly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Retirees:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adopt an 80/20 asset allocation (80% invested in A-share NASDAQ ETFs, 20% invested in cash or short-term bonds).</li>
<li>Rebalance regularly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Strategies:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open an Account in Hong Kong:</strong> Suggests that after investing for a period of time (such as 3-5 years), if conditions permit, investors can consider opening an account in Hong Kong to directly purchase US stock QQQ and QLD and enjoy lower transaction fees and more flexible investment options.</li>
<li><strong>Gradual Transition:</strong> Gradually transfer A-share assets to a Hong Kong account to achieve a more optimized asset allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong></li>
<li>Keep it simple when you first start investing
*   If the child&rsquo;s account is not managed by him, you can invest in QLD</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Question:</strong> Worries about inflation and the Fed&rsquo;s policies. Recently, US CPI data has risen, and the market is worried that the Fed will postpone interest rate cuts or even raise interest rates, which will negatively affect the stock market?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationship between Interest Rates and the Stock Market:</strong>
<ul>

<ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investing in Humanity&rsquo;s Financial Reports:</strong> Instead of looking at individual company financial reports and short-term economic situations, focus on the development trend of the entire human race over thousands of years. Invest in indexes, looking at the performance of all of humanity.</li>
<li><strong>Investors Are Always Extremely Optimistic:</strong> Investment requires long-term optimism, believing that the market will eventually rise.</li>
<li><strong>Overcoming Human Nature, Looking at the Market with a Cold Eye:</strong> Investors must overcome human weaknesses and not be affected by short-term market fluctuations. Need to practice remaining calm in the face of a tiger, believing there is glass in front of you, believing there is a safety net, no matter how the market falls.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding the Demons and Monsters of Capitalism:</strong> Recognize financial scams, insurance traps, and the government&rsquo;s wrong policies under the capitalist system, and avoid being exploited. Capitalism is efficient, but has side effects, coupled with financial industry scams, deception, and government collusion or wrong policies.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth is a Talent, and It Can Come True:</strong> The capitalist system allows everyone to have the opportunity to get rich, but requires correct knowledge and strategies. The education system is cultivating slave labor, while the financial industry is exploiting human weaknesses to sell fear. You can listen to Li Lu&rsquo;s speech to understand the difference between investment and speculation.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Young People:</strong> Young people who are still working should directly invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ) and consider using leveraged funds to increase returns. Young people must increase returns, there is no other choice, try to buy leveraged funds.</li>
<li><strong>Retirees:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Insufficient Assets: Take other strategies.</li>
<li>Sufficient Assets: Choose different asset allocation strategies depending on whether there is stock pledging and whether there are other income sources.
<ul>
<li><strong>No Pledging, Need to Withdraw Money from Assets:</strong> 80/20 principle (80% index funds, 20% cash).</li>
<li><strong>With Pledging, No Need to Withdraw Money from Stock Assets:</strong> 442 principle (40% index funds, 40% leveraged funds, 20% cash).</li>
<li><strong>No Pledging, No Other Income:</strong> 433 principle. If there is no other income, and you need to withdraw money from assets, only 80/20. Have stock pledging, do not need to withdraw money from assets to use 442.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Emergency Fund:</strong> Use 00864B as an emergency fund to cope with unexpected situations.</li>
<li><strong>About Loans:</strong>
<ul>
<li>All loans must be able to be repaid from salary or stable cash flow.</li>
<li>Try to pay off loans before retirement.</li>
<li>If there is a mortgage that has not been paid off after retirement, part of the funds can be invested in high-dividend ETFs (such as 0056), and the dividends used to pay the mortgage interest, with the remaining funds used for investment. For example, borrow NT$10 million, with an interest rate of 2.78%, and no repayment is required for 20 years. The annual interest is NT$278,000, requiring NT$4.5 million to be placed in 0056, because 0056 has a 6% dividend yield, and the remaining NT$5.5 million is added to the 433 or 442 allocation. If there is also rental income, you can use 442.</li>

<li><strong>Term Life Insurance:</strong> If you are the family&rsquo;s primary income earner and have minor children, you can purchase term life insurance to protect the family&rsquo;s financial security in the event of an accident. Only buy term life insurance that is purchased once a year, which is cheaper. If your assets reach 20-30 million, you don&rsquo;t need to insure anymore.</li>
<li><strong>Funds from Redeeming Insurance:</strong> Invest in index funds to obtain higher returns.</li>

<li><strong>Not Recommended to Purchase Property:</strong> Houses are fixed assets, lack liquidity, and have high risks. Taichung Shin Kong Mitsukoshi will close down, and real estate will too. If you buy a house to live in for 60 years, and are forced to live in the same house for 60 years, that&rsquo;s strange.</li>

<li>Question 1: The family income is divided between husband and wife. Is the 433 or 442 asset allocation based on the husband or the family income?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: It depends on each family&rsquo;s situation. If it is centrally managed or centrally thought out, you can think in the thinking mode of the whole family, depending on whether you understand the financial situation of the whole family. If the husband is more conservative and mostly in cash, the wife can be more aggressive and buy leveraged funds to balance it.</li>

<li>Question 2: My son is studying abroad, and the monthly expenses are NT$40,000. How should I include this in the expenses?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Treat this expense as a fixed deposit asset, deduct it directly from 00864B, and separate it from investment assets. This part will be spent this year and cannot be regarded as an investment asset. Transfer it directly to 00864B so that it will not be affected by market fluctuations for at least one year.</li>

<li>Question: Currently holding 00662 and 00670L, allocated in an 80/20 ratio, and not withdrawing money from stock assets, do I need to adjust to 442?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: If you need money, you can consider using credit, and then use the extra money you borrowed to allocate to 442. Borrow money, buy stocks with NT$1 million borrowed, and put NT$1 million in cash. Switching to 442 immediately will increase your return through two-tenths of the cash. Ask how much you can borrow. If the bank dares to lend, don&rsquo;t be afraid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: If gradually adjusting to 442, how to arrange the buying order?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Sell 00662 and convert to 00670L, as long as the total asset beta value is 1.2, the rate of return will remain unchanged. If you can take out a loan, take out the loan as soon as possible and adjust to 442 immediately. Hurry up and borrow, change it immediately.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Assets</strong>: Generally refer to all resources of economic value owned by an individual or household, including current assets (such as cash, deposits, stocks) and fixed assets (such as real estate, cars, collectibles). In everyday conversation, the &ldquo;assets&rdquo; or &ldquo;wealth&rdquo; people talk about usually refers to total assets.</li>
<li><strong>Liabilities</strong>: Refer to the debts owed by an individual or household, including short-term liabilities (such as credit card debt, consumer loans) and long-term liabilities (such as mortgages, car loans).</li>
<li><strong>Equity (Net Worth)</strong>: The balance after deducting liabilities from assets, representing the true wealth owned by an individual or household. This is an important financial indicator that reflects the true financial situation.
<ul>
<li><strong>Formula</strong>: Net Worth = Assets - Liabilities</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If you own a house worth 5 million, but still owe 3.5 million on the mortgage, then your net worth is 1.5 million (5 million - 3.5 million = 1.5 million).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>ROE (Return on Equity)</strong>: A metric that measures the efficiency of investing one&rsquo;s own funds, reflecting the return generated by each unit of net worth.
<ul>
<li><strong>Formula</strong>: ROE = Net Profit / Net Worth</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If your real estate net worth is 6 million (total price 15 million, loan 9 million), and the property appreciates by 500,000 in a year, then your ROE = 500,000 / 6 million = 8.33%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ROA (Return on Assets)</strong>: A metric that measures the efficiency of total asset utilization, reflecting the return generated by each unit of total assets.
<ul>
<li><strong>Formula</strong>: ROA = Net Profit / Total Assets</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If you invest 15 million in total assets (real estate) and earn 500,000 in a year, then ROA = 500,000 / 15 million ≈ 3.33%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ROI (Return on Investment)</strong>: A metric that measures the benefit of a specific investment project, reflecting the return generated by each unit of investment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Formula</strong>: ROI = (Investment Gain - Investment Cost) / Investment Cost</li>
<li><strong>Special Case</strong>: If all assets are used for investment and there are no idle funds, then ROA ≈ ROI.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impact of Borrowing</strong>: If borrowing is used for stock investment (such as margin trading, credit loans, mortgages, etc.), then the return on equity (ROE) will increase significantly because you leverage a larger investment scale with less of your own capital.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If you have 15 million in stock assets, of which 9 million is borrowed and 6 million is your own capital. The stock investment yields a 14% return in one year (2.1 million). Then ROA = 2.1 million / 15 million = 14%, and ROE = 2.1 million / 6 million = 35%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Cash</strong>: To control risk, investors usually don&rsquo;t invest all of their funds in the stock market and instead retain a portion of cash. This portion of cash reduces the overall return on investment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Beta</strong>: Beta &lt; 1 indicates that the volatility of the investment portfolio is less than the overall market volatility, usually meaning holding cash or low-risk assets.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If you have total assets of 15 million, of which 2 million is cash and the actual stock investment is 13 million. If the stock return is still 14%, then the total return is 1.82 million (13 million * 14%). ROA = 1.82 million / 15 million ≈ 12.13%, ROI = 1.82 million / 13 million = 14%.</li>
<li><strong>ROI of Short-Term Operators</strong>: Short-term operators or options traders typically only invest a small amount of capital. The &ldquo;return&rdquo; they talk about is often ROI rather than ROE. For example, they may have 1 million in funds but only use 100,000 for options trading and earn 30,000. They may say their ROI is 30%. But in reality, their ROE is only 3% (30,000 / 1 million).</li>

<li><strong>Independent Thinking</strong>: Don&rsquo;t easily listen to other people&rsquo;s investment advice. Develop your own investment system and judgment through self-study.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Awareness</strong>: If you are afraid of market declines and losses, then you may not be suitable for high-risk investments.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Investment</strong>: Invest in index funds such as QQQ and adhere to long-term holding without easily selling.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Individual Stocks</strong>: For most investors, avoid investing in individual stocks because they are riskier and can easily lead to significant losses.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme Optimism</strong>: Maintain an optimistic attitude towards the market, believing that the market will move upward in the long run and continue to reach new highs.</li>

<li>Question 1: Previously, it was mentioned that investing in QQQ/00662 contributes to the capitalist market, but if you buy a 2x leveraged ETF, which is essentially deployed through futures, does it still contribute to society? Is the contribution the same?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: There is a contribution, and it is a double contribution. Because there are many ways to hold assets, you can choose to directly hold the underlying stock or use financing (borrowing money) to expand the investment scale. Some 2x leveraged ETFs achieve this through borrowing, while others use futures and other derivatives. Regardless of the method, it is putting capital into the market, supporting the operation and development of businesses. Capitalists contribute the most to society by investing and allocating resources to the most promising companies. Investing in an index fund like QQQ means allocating funds to the best companies on the market, supporting their innovation and development, and thereby creating value for all of humanity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: The student&rsquo;s concern is that a large part of 2x leveraged ETFs consists of futures, and futures trading is perceived as a zero-sum game, where one party&rsquo;s profit necessarily means another party&rsquo;s loss. Would this contradict our previous emphasis on the concept of &ldquo;contributing to society&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: First of all, not all the funds in our investment portfolio have to be used for investment. We can keep a portion of cash. Secondly, futures trading can also be understood as a &ldquo;pre-purchase,&rdquo; similar to a &ldquo;red slip&rdquo; (pre-sale contract) when buying a house. You pay a deposit, locking in the future right to purchase, which provides financial support to the developer and promotes market liquidity. Futures trading is similar in that investors commit to buying or selling assets at a specific price at a future date, which provides liquidity and price discovery mechanisms to the market. Therefore, our investments, including the use of leveraged instruments, contribute to the market.</li>

<p>Share 1: Asset allocation of 433 and 442 should strictly follow the proportions of QQQ/QID/short-term bonds. In Taiwan, these are 00662, 00670L, and 00864B. Do not arbitrarily combine different targets, as this may deviate from our calculated expected returns and risks.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: If you have a mortgage or credit loan, it usually means you are still working. If you are retired, it is best not to have these loans, as this will increase your financial pressure. Retired people should not borrow credit loans and should pay off their mortgages. Net worth after retirement is the basis for calculating your retirement income (50 times your annual expenses). If you are still working, you can moderately use leverage (such as stock pledges), borrowing 2% of your stock assets for consumption while continuing to increase investment. As your assets increase, gradually adjust the proportion of borrowing and consumption. Also, remind everyone that if friends do not watch our investment tutorial videos, then do not advise them to invest, because investment requires doing your own homework and making decisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share 2: When combining your own investment targets, you must clearly understand the volatility of each target. We understand the characteristics of the QID or 00670L we recommend. If you combine them yourself and do not understand the volatility, you need to do your own simulation backtesting, otherwise the risk will be very high.</p>

<p>Question 1: I currently have 1/4 of my assets under my adult child&rsquo;s name, and I plan to retire in 3 years. Can this portion of assets under my child&rsquo;s name be included in my retirement fund calculation?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: No, once you have given it to your children, it is their asset. If you can freely access their money, then of course it can be counted as your asset, but you have to consider the possible legal and family relationship issues in the future. I suggest you transfer the money back into your account first, and only consider giving it to them after you are truly retired and your assets exceed 50 times your annual expenses. Before retirement, it is not recommended to give money to your children; just give a small amount of lucky money.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: If I include my child&rsquo;s account, I can retire now; but if I don&rsquo;t count this portion, my assets do not yet reach 50 times my annual expenses.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: If you want to retire, transfer the money back. Otherwise, there may be changes over time. After you retire, if your assets appreciate to more than you need, you can consider giving it to your children. At least this will ensure that your own retirement life is not affected.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>Question 3: I have invested in VOO and QQQ. When I see the market at a high point, should I sell first and buy back when it falls to a low point?</p>

<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Our investment strategy is to buy when we have money, hold for the long term, and not time the market.</li>

<li>
<p>Question 4: I bought an annuity many years ago, investing 150,000, and now I can only receive a few hundred dollars back each month. This annuity expires next year. Should I redeem it and invest on my own?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: If you can hold for the long term without easily selling, then the return on an annuity is usually very low, and you can consider redeeming it. But the premise is that you can withstand market fluctuations, even if the market falls 80%, can you still persist in holding on? If so, then redeem the annuity and invest in index funds such as QQQ.</li>

After listening to the teacher, I really want to convert some of these things into QQQ and leave the dividends behind. Is this good or bad?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: First, you need to determine whether you are retired, how much assets you have, and how much your annual expenses are. If you are retired and the dividend ETF is already enough to cover your living expenses, and you still have a surplus for investment, then you can continue to maintain this state. However if, you want to measure whether you have achieved financial freedom, for example: can you and your family travel to Europe and easily afford all the expenses? If you feel that your current state is very stable, very at ease, and you have enough tolerance for market fluctuations, then you can continue to maintain it. But, if the market declines, you may not be able to withstand it, so don&rsquo;t change it easily.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Suggestion: You can consider selling all your assets and buying 80% 00662 and 20% 00864B. Withdraw 2% of your assets annually as living expenses, and this completes the adjustment of asset allocation.

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: If the children are still young and have no income, then they cannot open a retirement account such as an IRA or Roth IRA. You can open a regular brokerage account for them, and you are the custodian of the account. You can set a deadline, such as when the children reach 22 or 24 years old, when the control of the account will be handed over to them. Until then, you manage the account entirely. If you withdraw money from the account, you need to pay capital gains tax. But our investment strategy is to hold for the long term without easily selling, so we usually don&rsquo;t need to pay taxes. Only when you have no work income and need money do you consider borrowing from the investment account.</li>

<ul>
<li>Share: I have been thinking about a problem recently. Assuming we invest in QQQ, after deducting inflation, the annual growth rate of actual purchasing power is about 10%. If a young person in the Bay Area has annual expenses of $120,000, how many years will it take to achieve financial freedom? If he saves $500 per month, calculated at a compound interest rate of 10%, it will take 46-47 years to accumulate more than 6 million. If he saves $1,000 per month, it will take 40 years. If he saves $3,000 per month, it will take 30 years. Like James retiring at the age of 42, if he only uses 20 years, then he must save at least $8,000 or more per month. Therefore, in addition to basic expenses, all the money that can be saved must be invested in the stock market to accumulate wealth as soon as possible. If income is not high, you can only exchange time for money.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Retirement is not that difficult. The key is to be stable and stick to it for 20 years. Young people should adopt a 442 asset allocation (40% QQQ, 40% QLD, 20% cash or short-term bonds), so that the beta coefficient is 1.2, and the annualized rate of return can reach about 17%. In this way, if you invest $3,000 per month, you can accumulate $6 million in 20 years. Therefore, young people must use leverage. A low rate of return is the biggest risk.</li>

<li>Question: I have been studying with you for three years and have invested in QQQ/00662, 00864B, and 00670L, which I feel has been very helpful. I plan to retire in 4 and a half years. My current asset allocation is 721 (70% QQQ, 20% QLD, 10% cash), and the beta coefficient is 1.1. Should I adjust the beta coefficient to 1.2?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: If you are still working, you can adjust to 1.2. But be aware that 4 and a half years is relatively short. If the market falls sharply, your assets may shrink significantly, making it impossible for you to retire as planned. Also, you mentioned that your current assets are about the same as your mortgage. If you still have a mortgage to pay after retirement, then your retirement income may not be enough. Assuming you have to pay 50,000 per month for your mortgage, that&rsquo;s 600,000 per year. Based on 50 times the retirement income calculation, you need to prepare 30 million to cover this expense. So, you need to carefully evaluate your assets, liabilities, and income after retirement before deciding whether to adjust your asset allocation. After retirement, leveraged funds should no longer be used.</li>

<li>Share 1: I would like to emphasize that whether we invest in prototype ETFs or leveraged ETFs, we are contributing to businesses and society. Even if you put money in the bank, the bank will use that money for investment. Including buying short-term bonds like 00864B provides capital to the government or businesses。
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: There is a contribution, but the degree is different. Putting money in the bank means the bank is making the contribution, and your contribution is limited. Investing in QQQ supports technological progress and contributes more.</li>

<li>Share 1: About DeepSeek. The demand for AI will only continue to increase, and the demand for computing power has only just begun. The emergence of DeepSeek has shown some small companies opportunities. Some small software companies in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan have found new business models.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: DeepSeek is a driving force for AI development. It adopts a more underlying development method (assembly language) that lowers the barrier to AI development. This makes AI applications more popular, allowing more companies, even companies in the third world, to participate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Share 2: Musk has not commented on DeepSeek this time, but he may be doing it quietly. If there is no internet data, can AI continue to develop? This is a question worth considering. Also, some Taiwanese companies are starting to pay attention to edge computing, which is also influenced by DeepSeek.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: Can AI replace existing industries? It&rsquo;s not clear yet. It&rsquo;s more about improving the efficiency of existing things. AI applications will become more and more common, but AI itself may not be a &ldquo;paradigm shift.&rdquo; In addition, AI may have an impact on search engines.

<blockquote>
<p>Investors should always face the sunshine, and the market will definitely break through new highs.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>James repeatedly emphasized the importance of a long-term perspective in investment, believing in the long-term upward trend of the market and not being disturbed by short-term fluctuations. Only by remaining optimistic can one persist in the market and obtain long-term returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capitalists are the biggest contributors to society and the people who contribute the most to the world. We have made the most effective allocation of resources.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>James believes that capitalists, through investment, allocate resources to the most promising and efficient businesses, supporting innovation and development, thereby promoting the progress and prosperity of the entire society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Living well is the most important thing. Don&rsquo;t save on taxes. We often say that saving on taxes is very important, but when it comes to inheritance, it&rsquo;s not your business, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Inherit as much as you can, but it&rsquo;s important to live well and with dignity.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>James, when answering questions about estate planning, emphasized that the quality of life for individuals during their lifetime is more important than the amount of inheritance. Don&rsquo;t sacrifice your current quality of life in order to save on taxes or accumulate excessive wealth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No investment is a life sentence. With investment, you usually get out in 30 years, 30 years at the latest.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>James encourages everyone to start investing as early as possible, even small amounts, as long as they persist in long-term investment, they can accumulate considerable wealth and eventually achieve financial freedom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You want their interest, and they want your life.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>James, when commenting on high-yield Covered Call ETFs, reminds everyone to pay attention to the high risks behind high yields. Don&rsquo;t be misled by high yields and ignore the potential loss of principal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having a house is being a rich poor person. It looks like you have a lot of assets, but you can&rsquo;t spend them; you can&rsquo;t spend freely.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>James believes that although real estate is an asset, it is illiquid and cannot be easily converted into cash, which may limit personal spending power and quality of life. Over-concentration on real estate investment may lead to the predicament of &ldquo;having assets but no cash.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that general companies that adapt to AI usually fail, because that cost will be beyond your imagination, and it will slow down your performance.
&ndash; Brian</p></blockquote>
<p>Brian pointed out, when discussing AI applications, that many companies may encounter problems such as high costs and reduced efficiency when trying to introduce AI. The application of AI technology is not easy and requires careful planning and implementation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do you find that the Tesla Model 9 has been completely changed? The whole thing cannot be gradually changed from the old one, gone, retrained.
&ndash; Brian</p></blockquote>
<p>Brian mentioned that updates to Tesla&rsquo;s self-driving system usually employ entirely new models rather than incrementally improving existing models. This illustrates that the iteration and development of AI technology may be leaping, and old technology may be quickly eliminated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To achieve creation and thinking, you have to be better today than yesterday. How can anyone catch up with you that way?
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>James emphasized that continuous learning and innovation are key to staying competitive. Whether in the field of investment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Buy with money, never sell no matter what
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>James summarized that the best strategy for long-term investors is to choose quality assets (such as the QQQ index fund), hold them for the long term, don&rsquo;t time the market, and don&rsquo;t sell easily.</p>

<p>This episode primarily shares the power of compound interest in long-term investing and discusses whether the 80/20 asset allocation strategy for retirees can be used for collateralization. James uses specific examples and data analysis to emphasize the importance of compound interest in long-term investing and the key issues to consider when using the 80/20 asset allocation for collateralization. For example, while it&rsquo;s possible for retirees to use the 80/20 allocation for collateral, there are many restrictions. For safety, retirees should stick to the 433 allocation for collateralization.</p>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Usable Funds Ratio for Collateralized Borrowing</strong>: The annual available funds for collateralized borrowing are 2% of retirement reserves (assuming your retirement reserves are 50 times your annual expenses). If your retirement reserves are NT$30 million, the annual available funds are NT$600,000 (NT$30 million * 2% = NT$600,000). This NT$600,000 is fixed. Even if the NT$30 million becomes NT$20 million due to market fluctuations, you can still use NT$600,000. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about a decrease in available funds because of market drop.</li>
<li><strong>Spending Strategy During Market Downturns</strong>: You do not need to reduce spending during a market downturn. You can increase spending during a market upswing. In other words, our annual spending will only increase, not decrease.</li>
<li><strong>Spending Adjustment Strategies</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Upswing Scenario</strong>: For example, with a retirement reserve of NT$30 million, after 5 years, assets increase from NT$30 million to NT$50 million, and the net assets (after deducting debt, including 5 years of expenses, and annual interest, totaling NT$3.22 million) are NT$46.78 million (NT$50 million - NT$3.22 million = NT$46.78 million). At this point, annual available funds can be adjusted to NT$930,000 (NT$46.78 million * 2% = NT$930,000). However, this NT$930,000 includes interest expenses. Assuming the previous loan of NT$3.22 million and a 3% interest rate, the annual interest expense is about NT$100,000, and the actual available funds are NT$830,000 (NT$930,000 - NT$100,000 = NT$830,000).</li>
<li><strong>Downturn Scenario</strong>: There is no need to reduce spending during a market downturn. You can still maintain the peak spending level (e.g., if the peak spending was NT$900,000, you can still maintain NT$900,000 per year even if assets drop to NT$30 million). This allocation strategy is based on a model that assumes a 10-year decline from the peak, which can be fully sustained even under the extreme scenario of a 10-year decline.</li>
<li><strong>Core Principle for Spending Adjustments</strong>: Only increase spending, not decrease it, and it&rsquo;s recommended to adjust it every 5 years to avoid frequent adjustments.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Retirees who do not utilize collateralization can use an 80/20 asset allocation, i.e., 80% invested in QQQ and 20% in cash.</strong></li>
<li><strong>An 80/20 asset allocation, without collateralization, allows for simple rebalancing yearly without risk of bankruptcy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you must utilize the 80/20 asset allocation for collateralization, please be aware:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Absolutely do not use cash to rebalance in the market, cash must only increase, not decrease.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Market downturns may last up to 10 years. If you borrow 2% annually, you will borrow more than 20% in 10 years. If you then invest cash, your total assets may be less than 20%. Therefore, using an 80/20 asset allocation for collateralization is high risk.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A safer approach is still a 433 allocation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you must use the 80/20 allocation for collateralization, rebalancing intelligently only during upswing years, that is, can only transfer cash from the prototype fund (QQQ), it is not allowed to transfer cash into QQQ during downswing years, can transfer cash into QQQ during upswing years.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Whenever making an asset allocation or adjustment, assume that it&rsquo;s the market&rsquo;s highest point.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Spending does not need to be reduced during a 10-year decline, as the allocation strategy has been verified through simulations as feasible.</strong></li>
<li>When assets have risen to a new high (e.g., from NT$30 million to NT$45 million), you can reset the spending amount. Even if the market declines again afterwards, you don&rsquo;t need to reduce spending because it is already close to the bottom, and risk is reduced.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Angel is a young man currently studying in the United States. He turns 21 the next day. His parents are very supportive and hardworking, allowing Angel to study in the U.S. without worry. Angel&rsquo;s parents hope he can live a wealthy life, so they advised him to learn investment and financial management with James and promised to give him funds to invest.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: If James were 21 again, with his current knowledge and parental support, how would he invest?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: If James were 21 again with his current knowledge and parental support, he would use a 442 allocation to buy in all at once. Additionally, the teacher shared two investment mistakes he made when he was young: investing in real estate, which he bought for 8 million and sold for only 6 million after 10 years, resulting in a significant loss; and selling company stock to buy a car. These two poor decisions resulted in his assets being reduced by half. The teacher used his own example to emphasize: <strong>$100,000 for a young person, with time, compounded at 14% annually, will be $25 million in 60 years; $10,000 for a young person is $2.6 million in the future, so young people should learn to save and invest first and then learn to spend money when the time is right.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Besides human nature, why is it not advisable for someone of my age to put all my money into QQQ, but rather 433 or 442?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Human nature is the most important factor that must be considered in investment. You cannot exclude the factor of &ldquo;human nature&rdquo;. If you don&rsquo;t consider human nature, then don&rsquo;t invest. For example, investors often overestimate their risk tolerance. Investment should avoid getting yourself into a state of extreme panic. Allocating all your assets to QQQ or half in QQQ and half in cash overestimates your risk tolerance. Although the market will eventually go up in the long term, your assets may fall to extremely low values during a market downswing, for example: from 100 to 80, 70, 60, then finally falling down to 5, 1. During this process, you might have already gone bankrupt and exited, even if you survive until market rise, it no longer has anything to do with you. It’s like playing Russian roulette: a revolver with 6 chambers, and 1 bullet. If the person firing doesn’t die, they will get 10 million; if they do die, they die. You should not participate because of the high reward. You could die. So young people&rsquo;s beta should not exceed 1.2.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: Has retired and currently uses a power account as a reserve for daily living. The account balance is usually 0. Money is only used when a large expense happens or an emergency occurs. This practice brings her peace of mind. She doesn&rsquo;t need to keep a lot of cash in her daily account so that she could effectively use cash for investment purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: After retiring, I do not want to use leveraged funds (like QLD), but I am worried about a stock market crash. Is it feasible to use the 80/20 (80% in QQQ and 20% in cash) asset allocation strategy?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Yes, it is feasible. An 80/20 asset allocation, if you don&rsquo;t do collateralization, can do simple rebalancing yearly. Because she is retired, and the funds in her collateralization account have not been used, which is equivalent to her not using collateralization, she can use the 80/20 asset allocation strategy under that circumstance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: Has started Roth IRA conversion and plans to complete all the conversion within the next few years when the tax rate is lower.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Some people suggested using up the 32% tax rate, but I cannot mentally accept it, as it may mean paying higher taxes. Is it okay to just use up the 24% tax rate and deal with the rest during RMD time?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: You can complete all the conversions before the RMD age, as long as you finish before RMD, as money cannot be transferred into a Roth IRA after RMD age. Money can only be transferred into a brokerage account, which is not beneficial to inheritance. It is recommended to transfer the funds from the retirement account to a Roth IRA as much as possible, as the Roth IRA&rsquo;s heir does not need to pay taxes within 10 years, while the Traditional IRA&rsquo;s heir needs to pay taxes. Converting early can avoid higher taxes in the future. If you still do the conversion when the market drops, it means your conversion decision is correct. Although you may have to pay as high as 30% tax now during conversion, you can avoid higher taxes in the future in the long run (because your assets will grow significantly over time, so you will have to pay more taxes later).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: YJ would first like to thank James and the &ldquo;00662&rdquo; group, especially for Chen Feng&rsquo;s sharing and James&rsquo;s supplementation, which make everyone&rsquo;s investment concepts clearer.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: The Chinese concept of &ldquo;having land is having wealth&rdquo; needs to be updated. In the current era, this &ldquo;land&rdquo; should not be real estate but rather &ldquo;stocks&rdquo;. The old concept of &ldquo;having land is having wealth&rdquo; refers to farmland that can be cultivated and has output, which is similar concept to current day investing in stocks.</li>
<li><strong>Suggestion</strong>: There are no more lectures on the 100 Million Investment topic this year. The 9 situations in the 00005 topic have been simplified into 2 situations. Can there be a &ldquo;00006&rdquo; topic, specifically on the &ldquo;collateralization&rdquo; part, with a simpler presentation?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: &ldquo;Having land is having wealth&rdquo; did not refer to houses in the past, as houses were not valuable in those eras and this term referred to farmlands. Today&rsquo;s &ldquo;having land is having wealth&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;having stocks is having wealth&rdquo;, stocks are the true assets. Regarding your suggestion of topic 00006, James believes the existing sharing is already simplified enough. Users using collateralization should use the 433 allocation and make &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; using 2% of their assets yearly, and there is no need for a more complicated topical presentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: Previously, I sent a message on YouTube mentioning the video 00303 in March 2022, and you suggested to not use TQ (TQQQ) back then. However, two months ago (around November), you replied that a 6TQQ+2U+2Cash strategy can be used with a 6:2:2 allocation. Does this strategy and comparison with the 442 strategy feasible?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: TQQ can be used. The suggestion in previous videos was based on the understanding at the time, so single-asset investment in TQQ was not recommended. However, now, if you have an asset allocation (like 6:2:2, which is 60% in TQQ, 20% in U, and 20% in Cash) and do &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo;, this strategy is viable. Investment strategies and concepts are constantly evolving and improving. Ideas considered impossible in the past may now be proven to be feasible.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: BOXX&rsquo;s operating mechanism is similar to 00864B. As long as its return is trending similarly to the US Federal Funds Rate, its risk is controllable. You should pay serious attention when the return is much higher or lower than the US Federal Funds Rate, as it may indicate some irregular financial operations. BOXX&rsquo;s primary function is to reasonably avoid investment income tax, and it can be used as a short-term investment target.</li>

<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Yes, you should. You can be her benefactor. However, she may not accept advice directly.

You can also co-invest with her proportionally, for example, if she invests ¥100, you can invest ¥100 for her. Once she sees a return, she will then invest automatically.</li>

After several failed investments, he not only had real estate and stocks but was also in debt at 40 years old. He had to work to repay his debts even in his 70s. IAM is very grateful he found CLEC in 2022 and avoided going down the same path as the doctor.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: James often says &ldquo;slow is fast,&rdquo; and investment should not be rushed. However, everyone&rsquo;s understanding of &ldquo;fast&rdquo; and &ldquo;slow&rdquo; is different. Can you please explain how to measure &ldquo;fast&rdquo; and &ldquo;slow&rdquo; in investing and how to view the concept of &ldquo;40 years is too long&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Everything has its own rules and timings, like pregnancy and childbirth, which takes ten months and cannot be shortened. The same applies to investing. Wealth growth takes time. You cannot expect to harvest tomorrow what you planted today. It takes 10 years of investment to feel wealthy, 20 years to retire, 30 years to be prosperous, and 40 years to become rich. This requires time, one cannot be hasty. Warren Buffett did not become the world&rsquo;s richest man at 30 or 40, but after 55 years old. Investing requires understanding the essence and rules of time. Do not be impatient. Every thing operates following its rules and timings. It&rsquo;s a rule of nature and cannot be rushed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Why do people haggle over small amounts of money, but at the same time act recklessly like gamblers when it comes to investing?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: This all stems from humanity&rsquo;s &ldquo;loss aversion&rdquo; mentality. People do not like to lose, so they haggle over prices when shopping, but they tend to focus only on the gains and ignore the risks when investing. During investment, people often forget past losses and only think about making more money in the future. This is the gambler&rsquo;s mentality. When shopping, people compare prices since they can lose less and, by nature, they will haggle. In investing, people think that the more they invest, the more they will earn; while ignoring the possibility of losses, hence they will not haggle. It&rsquo;s like if you go to buy a cake, and the owner says the cake is 100, you might haggle and say can it be 90? But if the owner says you buy my cake and tomorrow I&rsquo;ll return 300, you won&rsquo;t haggle anymore, you&rsquo;d think the more expensive, the better.</li>

Buffett would pick it up without hesitation and check if there are any other coins around; and Bill Gates would also pick up that cent. This story illustrates the principles of &ldquo;every little bit counts&rdquo; and &ldquo;compound interest.&rdquo; Even the wealthy do not overlook the importance of &ldquo;saving&rdquo; because when Mike was on a business trip to Microsoft in 1992, Microsoft was already a listed company, and Bill Gates was already very wealthy at that time. One of the employees criticized Bill Gates for using coupons when shopping for groceries. Later, one time, Bill Gates was looking for his coupon when checking out. The person behind him said, don&rsquo;t worry, I will pay, you earn more than this in one minute. However, Bill Gates did not ignore the person behind him, he continued to search for his coupon.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: Opinions regarding Deep Seek: Recently, AI technology is developing rapidly, with various new technologies and applications emerging, including Deep Seek, which will have a significant impact on QQQ&rsquo;s future. Currently, American technology giants seem to have a &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; mentality, believing that they can win the AI race as long as they invest enough resources. However, historical experience shows that technological leadership does not necessarily win the market, the business model is also important.</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>:</li>
<li>Deep Seek, like many other AI technologies, is still in the early stages, and there will be many uncertainties in the future. But what is certain is that AI will have a profound impact on human society and bring huge opportunities for investors.</li>
<li>Regarding the competition between the US and China in the field of AI, it is still difficult to judge who will ultimately win. The US has advantages in technology and funds, but China also has its own advantages, such as large amounts of data and government support.</li>
<li>AI is not only large language models (LLM), there are many other applications, for example: Tesla&rsquo;s autonomous driving. Tesla&rsquo;s autonomous driving model is already very mature, it can automatically drive out from the parking lot and the driving experience is very smooth, just like a professional driver is driving for you.</li>
<li>AI will not completely replace human jobs but increase our work efficiency. For example, even for translators, you can use AI to improve the efficiency and quality of translation. Therefore, humans need to learn how to utilize AI, not reject it.</li>
<li>Currently, the biggest problem is that many large companies want to introduce AI, but they do not have a clear idea, they do not know whether it needs to be from top down or from bottom-up. James thinks it needs to be from bottom-up, the employees should use them first, so they are accustomed before moving up. But this requires time and because everyone is changing the thinking process of using AI.</li>
<li>AI will cause QQQ&rsquo;s annual returns to be much higher than 14%, or even 20% or 30%. James is very optimistic about this.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Based in Canada, 35 years old, plans to sell his house and invest the proceeds from the sale. Both he and his wife are currently working.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: A plan to invest 20% in cash, 40% in QLD, 40% in QQ for long term investment and do smart rebalancing, is this investment plan correct?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: The plan is correct. Young people who are still working can use a 442 asset allocation, which is 40% in QQQ, 40% in QLD, and 20% in cash, and then do smart rebalancing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Canada has high taxes, and capital gains tax is heavy. What are your suggestions for long-term planning?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: People&rsquo;s destiny is controlled by three factors: the first is fate (DNA); the second is destiny (place of birth); and the third is luck. The place of birth determines one&rsquo;s destiny. Canada, Europe, and Australia are not as good as the US. If financially possible, consider immigrating to the US, not just for yourself but also for your descendants.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Event 1</strong>: Shared two experiences of encountering potential &ldquo;scams&rdquo;. One time was meeting someone on a highway who claimed to be from Dubai, needing help. This person was dressed neatly, drove a BMW, and claimed to have run out of gas and had no money or was robbed. This person wore gold and asked Hao Qing for help, claiming that he could give his gold to Hao Qing. Hao Qing gave him 40 yuan, but he wanted more. Hao Qing felt that something was wrong, and so did not give any more. The second time, he encountered the same person on the road again, so he called the police.</li>
<li><strong>Event 2</strong>: A colleague&rsquo;s relative, an 80-year-old, was scammed for 600,000 yuan. This old person did not believe what nearby people said about it being a scam, and believed that since he raised his children for so many years, it was not unfilial to ask them for money to invest and everyone was stopping him. When going to the bank, the bank employees also told him that it was a scam. The police also came to give him risk warnings that the money could not be transferred, but this old person still did not believe it and was scammed for 600,000 yuan.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Views</strong>: Hao Qing thinks that he is a kind-hearted person. When he sees someone in trouble, he will help to the best of his ability. However, he will be more careful when it comes to money. Also, there are now many scams and the success rate for solving them is extremely low. He is not sure if it&rsquo;s the government&rsquo;s problem or individual&rsquo;s problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: While discussing &ldquo;US-China trade&rdquo; with colleagues, his colleagues think that China may devalue the renminbi to deal with the US tariffs. He does not agree with this point of view but does not know how to explain it.</li>
<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How should we view the three problems of &ldquo;scams&rdquo;, &ldquo;Taiwan policy&rdquo;, and “RMB devaluation”?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>About Scams:</strong> The US does not care because the US thinks that if you are scammed, it means you are stupid. Furthermore, the person that Hao Qing encountered is technically not breaking a legal law, even if you report, it is useless. All the police can do is to chase him away. Why are there scams? It&rsquo;s because of &ldquo;poverty&rdquo;. When it&rsquo;s difficult to earn money through normal ways, &ldquo;scamming&rdquo; becomes a way to get rich quickly. So, you still need to start from the systems, and education aspect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>About Taiwan policies</strong>: The US has completely free capitalism where the market determines prices. When prices increase, wages increase, which will then increase interest rates and suppress inflation, ultimately creating a positive economic cycle. Taiwan&rsquo;s policies, to a certain degree, hinders this positive economic cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding the RMB devaluation expectations</strong>: This problem is complex and interlinked. It cannot be simply solved via devaluation.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>When investing, you need to see results. You want to see results like Buffett&rsquo;s. Of course, everyone&rsquo;s level is different. When you feel you are living a prosperous life, you will also need 40 years. You cannot be hasty.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This point explains the importance of &ldquo;time&rdquo; and the power of &ldquo;compound interest&rdquo; in long-term investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value of life lies in learning, thinking, serving others, and growing, not just working and making money.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This point emphasizes that the meaning of life lies in continuous learning, growth, and serving society, not just the pursuit of material wealth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You also need an appropriate amount of time to grow wealth to a certain extent. Therefore, you need to recognize that time exists first.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This emphasizes that wealth accumulation requires time and patience, and one should not take any shortcuts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you do when everything is destroyed? You need a way out.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re investing or doing anything else, you have to consider if this thing fails, and whether you have a way out. Or whether you can bear the losses caused by that failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today if you buy a Tesla car but you&rsquo;re afraid of it getting scratched, you&rsquo;re afraid of washing it. After washing it, you&rsquo;re afraid to drive it. Every time you drive it out, you&rsquo;re afraid of people wanting to borrow it, or when your daughter wants to borrow it, you&rsquo;d always say no and no. You&rsquo;re a slave to wealth. It&rsquo;s okay to drive. I have insurance. If it is crashed I can buy a new one. This is wealth. Therefore, don&rsquo;t be a slave to your assets, never be.  It&rsquo;s better not to buy it, instead of buying it and then using up your mental energy over it. We should not spend any mental energy on material things. This is very important. This is the key to happiness.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>We should not be slaves to &ldquo;wealth,&rdquo; and should not be controlled by &ldquo;material things.&rdquo; If something affects your mood, do not buy it because you cannot afford it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People&rsquo;s destiny is controlled by three factors: The first is fate (DNA); the second is destiny (place of birth); and the third is luck.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>The place of birth determines destiny. If you are born in the United States, you have the American destiny; if you are born in Taiwan, you have the Taiwan destiny; if you are born in Australia, you have the Australian destiny.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am still going to tell everyone that we are going to be very wealthy, so when you want to immigrate you have to think twice. If it&rsquo;s me, I&rsquo;d rather spend 800,000 USD to immigrate to the US instead of using less money to immigrate to Canada, Europe, or the NSW. Because the destinies are different. Look at the world&rsquo;s top ten companies, and nine are from the US. Only one is TSMC from China, but TSMC is also cultivated in the US. To say it bluntly, all the world&rsquo;s top ten companies were founded by Americans, this is fate.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>When considering immigration, one should think not only for themselves but also the fate of future generations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An 80/20 allocation without collateralization can do simple rebalancing yearly without risk of bankruptcy.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Retirees that do not do collateralization may utilize an 80/20 asset allocation where 80% is invested in QQQ and 20% is kept in cash, and can do simple rebalancing without risk of bankruptcy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The US does not care about scams, they don&rsquo;t even care about the 0-dollar purchase scams, so why would they care about scams? Therefore, there is a cost accounting issue. If a country wants to be strong, it needs strong cost accounting. What do you want? Right and wrong is about competing, and everyone needs to know that prosperity is a key, and poverty is a disease. Being poor for an emerging country is a disease, if one is poor it&rsquo;s a disease.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>The United States is strong due to its sound system and market economy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Always maintain extreme optimism in investing and believe that the market will always go up.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Maintain an optimistic attitude throughout the investment process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI may not necessarily solely rely on computing power. It can also rely on the human brain.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This point explains that in the development of AI, in addition to computing power, the human brain can also play an important role.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market Volatility Is Irrelevant to Long-Term Investors</strong>: Short-term market fluctuations are normal. Long-term investors should adhere to the principle of &ldquo;buy when you have money, hold long term, and never sell,&rdquo; and not be swayed by market sentiment. Utilize the power of compound interest to hold quality assets for the long term. For example, even if the market experiences a significant pullback, as long as you hold a Nasdaq 100 index fund for the long term, you will ultimately achieve substantial returns.</li>

Please be wary of any investment schemes online that claim to guarantee returns, especially those using celebrity endorsements or AI-synthesized voiceovers; many are scams. COEC does not charge anyone a fee nor does it recommend any paid investment services.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Risk Warning</strong>: Investing involves risk, and the stock market is highly volatile. Investors should be fully aware of investment risks. For example, investing in stock index funds such as QQQ may face a short-term loss of 50% or even more of their market value.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investing Requires Continuous Learning</strong>: James emphasizes the importance of learning and encourages everyone to watch the value investing lecture series videos, recommending episodes 00451, 00398, and 00288. There are also condensed short films in the playlist to help everyone quickly grasp the core content and to share with friends and family. Only through continuous learning can we enhance our investment knowledge and judgment.</li>
<li><strong>Q&amp;A Only Refines Your Existing Knowledge, Not Establishes It</strong>: This means that the Q&amp;A session can only help you further understand what you have already learned, but cannot replace systematic study. For example, concerning how to specifically implement the 433 asset allocation strategy, you need to first watch relevant videos for a systematic understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Nasdaq 100 Index Funds</strong>: James recommends long-term investment in Nasdaq 100 index funds (such as QQQ and TQQQ) and provides a list of Nasdaq 100 index fund options around the world for investors in different regions to reference.</li>
<li><strong>Investor Optimism</strong>: Despite market fluctuations and uncertainties, investors should maintain an extremely optimistic mindset. Market declines should be seen as opportunities to buy quality assets at lower prices. In the long run, the economy and the stock market will always trend upwards.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth Growth Requires Time</strong>: Investing is a long-term process. Wealth growth needs time to realize the effects of compound interest. For example, by investing in a Nasdaq 100 index fund for the long term, waiting for ten or twenty years, assets could potentially grow to a scale of hundreds of millions.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of Long-Term Investing</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Compound Interest Effect</strong>: Long-term investing can fully utilize the effects of compound interest, achieving exponential growth of wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Emotional Trading</strong>: Long-term investing can avoid making poor investment decisions due to short-term market fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce Transaction Costs</strong>: Long-term investing can reduce the frequency of trading, thereby lowering transaction costs.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis of the US Balance Sheet</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Detailed Data</strong>: James provided detailed US balance sheet data, including:
<ul>
<li><strong>Total US Government and Private Borrowing</strong>: This refers to the total domestic debt of all forms in the United States.</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets</strong>: $202 trillion, representing the total value of all US assets.</li>
<li><strong>Deficit</strong>: $36 trillion, referring to the US government&rsquo;s fiscal deficit.</li>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities</strong>: $101 trillion, including the total debt of the government and the public, which is actually the amount of US currency issued.</li>
<li><strong>GDP</strong>: $28.57 trillion, representing the total value of all goods and services produced within the US in one year.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Tax Revenue</strong>: $12 trillion, referring to the US federal government&rsquo;s tax revenue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Income Estimation</strong>: Based on an average tax rate of 15%, it is estimated that the total income of US individuals and companies is about $80 trillion. James pointed out that because corporate tax rates are usually higher than 20%, this estimate may actually underestimate the actual income of the US, and the real number might be close to $100 trillion.</li>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Income Ratio</strong>: By comparing total liabilities to income, the US debt-to-income ratio was calculated and compared with individual debt-to-income ratios, explaining that the US balance sheet is very healthy and will not experience a debt crisis or bankruptcy as some people fear.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: The US was compared to an individual with $202 million worth of real estate, owing $100 million, and with an annual income of $80 million, illustrating that its financial situation is very healthy. In comparison, many people have an income far less than $80 million but carry huge mortgage debts, and their personal financial situation is much worse than that of the US.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Relationship Between the US Dollar and US Stocks</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Holding Assets, Not Currency</strong>: Investing in US index funds is actually holding a portfolio of assets composed of excellent US companies, rather than holding the US dollar as a currency.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of US Dollar Depreciation</strong>: Even if the US dollar depreciates, as long as the assets held (such as stocks) have value, the price of assets denominated in US dollars will rise.</li>
<li><strong>The US Dollar Is Just a Unit of Account</strong>: The US dollar is only a unit for measuring asset value and can be exchanged for assets using any other form of currency or valuable item. For example, real estate can be used to exchange for Apple shares or QQQ assets, without needing to go through the US dollar.</li>
<li><strong>US Dollar Credit Backing</strong>: The US dollar, as a fiat currency, is backed by national credit. The US government can repay its debt by taxing companies and individuals. Therefore, as long as US companies and individuals can continue to generate income, the US can repay its debts, and the US dollar will not collapse.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing Strategy</strong>: Since the US dollar may depreciate, it is advisable to borrow as much US dollars as possible to invest or consume. In the future, debt can be repaid using depreciated US dollars.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Refuting the Bankruptcy Theory</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Cited data and facts to refute the view that &ldquo;excessive US debt will lead to bankruptcy.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Emphasized that the US has vast assets and a continuous source of income, which is enough to repay its debts.</li>
<li>Pointed out that those who spread such statements may have ulterior motives, and investors should think independently and not blindly believe them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Holding of Quality Assets</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Emphasized the importance of long-term holding of high-quality US assets (such as the Nasdaq 100 index fund).</li>
<li>Even if the US dollar depreciates, the value of quality assets will continue to grow.</li>
<li>Example: If QQQ is currently $500, after a large US dollar depreciation, QQQ may rise to $10,000 because it represents the assets of 100 excellent US technology companies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>No Need to Worry About the US Dollar</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Investors should focus on the value of the assets themselves, rather than fluctuations in the US dollar.</li>
<li>US dollar depreciation is actually a good thing for investors holding quality assets because they can buy the same assets with fewer US dollars.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>433 Asset Allocation</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: The 433 asset allocation is an investment strategy that allocates 40% of total assets to QQQ (Nasdaq 100 index fund), 30% to TQQQ (3x leveraged Nasdaq 100 index fund), and 30% to cash or money market funds.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: By allocating assets with different risk levels, balance risk and return.</li>
<li><strong>Operation</strong>: Conduct &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; according to market conditions, that is, when the market rises, transfer some of the profits from TQQQ to cash; when the market falls, transfer cash to TQQQ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Smart Rebalancing</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanism</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>When the market rises</strong>: Convert some of the profits (usually 30%) from leveraged funds (such as TQQQ) into cash.</li>
<li><strong>When the market falls</strong>: Convert cash into leveraged funds in a certain proportion (usually 20% of the cash portion).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Effects</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>At market highs</strong>: The cash level is high, reducing the risk of a high-level pullback.</li>
<li><strong>At market lows</strong>: The cash level is low, allowing for buying more assets at lower prices, thus achieving greater returns when the market rebounds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Auto-Pilot</strong>: The smart rebalancing mechanism can automatically adjust asset allocation according to market conditions without manual intervention.</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: The internet bubble in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008 were used to illustrate how the 433 asset allocation and smart rebalancing mechanism protect investors&rsquo; assets during significant market volatility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Necessity of Long-Term Investment</strong>: Citing Howard Marks&rsquo;s views, it is explained that predicting short-term market trends is almost impossible, and frequent trading will only increase costs and risks. For ordinary investors, holding passive funds (such as QQQ) for the long term is a wiser choice.</li>

<li><strong>Essence of the Financial Industry</strong>: The goal of the financial industry is to maximize its own interests and may &ldquo;empty&rdquo; investors&rsquo; pockets through various means. Investors must improve their financial literacy to recognize and resist the traps and temptations of the financial industry. For example, long-term bond products may appear stable in name, but still have the potential to lose 30% or more.</li>
<li><strong>Information Filter Bubble Effect</strong>: The development of the internet and social media makes it easier for people to access information that matches their own views, thus forming information filter bubbles and making it difficult to hear different opinions. This leads to biases in people&rsquo;s understanding of the world and even conflicting emotions.</li>
<li><strong>Australian 2x Leveraged Fund GNDQ</strong>: Introduced an Australian market 2x leveraged fund called GNDQ, for Australian investors to reference.</li>
<li><strong>International Situation and Investment</strong>: Although we may know nothing about the international situation, this does not affect our long-term investments. The important thing is to choose the right investment targets and stick to them for the long term.</li>
<li><strong>Allocation Strategies for Roth IRA and Traditional IRA</strong>: It is recommended to invest all the funds in Roth IRA in TQQQ to maximize tax-free returns. Traditional IRA can allocate a portion to cash and a portion to QQQ, with the specific ratio depending on individual circumstances.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Labor and Real Estate</strong>: Labor is facing the risk of unemployment, especially with the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Real estate also has risks, such as natural disasters and market volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of AI on the Future</strong>: The development of AI will have a huge impact on the job market, with a large number of jobs being replaced by AI. In the future, society may only be left with a small number of capitalists and people who can control AI, while others may become &ldquo;useless&rdquo; laborers. Therefore, one should no longer learn coding but should use AI to serve oneself.</li>
<li><strong>Predictions on Future High-Tech Returns</strong>: Some finance professionals predict that future high-tech returns will decrease. James refuted this view, believing that these predictions are baseless and pointed out that the investment performance of these predictors is also poor.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage Learning and Sharing</strong>: Encourage everyone to watch the short films of the investment lectures and share them with more people to help them build correct investment philosophies.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>:
<ol>
<li>The annualized return rate of long-term investment does not mean that fixed returns can be obtained every year. If the investment period is too short, the desired results may not be achieved due to market fluctuations. She cited a chart from a book called &ldquo;The Long View,&rdquo; which shows the highest and lowest returns for different investment periods. For example, investing for one year, the highest return might be 66%, but it could also result in a loss of 38%; investing for two years, the highest return is 39.4%, but it could also lead to a loss of 31.7%; investing for five years, the highest return is 27.3%, but it could also result in a loss of 11.9%. Only when the investment period is more than 20 years is it possible to obtain a return ranging from a minimum of 6% to a maximum of 17%. In summary, the longer the investment period, the more the return rate tends to approach the long-term average.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: The longer the investment period, the closer the return is to the average. For example, if you invest for 25 years, the return will increasingly approach 10%. This explains the significance of the 433 asset allocation: short-term cash needs can be met with the cash position, while long-term investment is not affected. For example, if an investment portfolio has 10 million in long-term investments and 1 million for school tuition, the 1 million can be combined with the 10 million for 433 allocation. This would mean 300,000 in cash, and even if the market declines, the 300,000 cash can cover tuition needs. It was also emphasized that stock pledging can further reduce risk, because low-interest funds can be borrowed to meet emergency needs.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: The company&rsquo;s 401K plan can deposit 30% of income, which is far more than the IRS limit. The extra funds are put into an after-tax account. If the principal of this part is transferred to Roth IRA, and the appreciated part is transferred to Regular IRA, are there any tax issues with such operations?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: The after-tax 401K plan you mentioned is actually a tax-deferred account, which allows investors to put their after-tax income into it and conduct tax-free trading, but still have to pay taxes when finally withdrawn. For short-term operators, this type of account can avoid tax liabilities caused by frequent trading. However, for long-term investors like us, we do not make frequent buying and selling transactions, so this type of account does not have much appeal to us. The disadvantage of participating in this plan is that it actually increases the size of your Traditional IRA, and we generally advise against having too large a Traditional IRA because you will have to pay income tax when you withdraw in the future. Therefore, I do not recommend that you continue to participate and put money into this after-tax 401K plan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: I am 60 years old, and my current asset allocation is 70% of my money in Traditional IRA, 10% in Roth IRA, and 15% in Regular IRA. How should I allocate my assets?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Given that your Roth IRA ratio is low, it is recommended to invest all the funds in your Roth IRA into TQQQ (3x leveraged Nasdaq 100 index fund) to maximize its potential for tax-free growth. For your Traditional IRA, it is recommended to allocate 20% to cash and 80% to QQQ (Nasdaq 100 index fund). This will make your overall asset allocation closer to the target of 433 (40% QQQ, 30% TQQQ, 30% cash).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: I am already using asset-backed loans, borrowing about 1% of the funds each year for use. According to the asset allocation ratio recommended by the teacher, my current cash ratio is insufficient. What should I do?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: In this case, you don&rsquo;t need to specifically increase your cash ratio. You only need to allocate 20% of the cash in your Traditional IRA and the remaining 80% to QQQ, and all the money in your Roth IRA to TQQQ. Use asset-backed loans to meet your daily expenses and tax payments, so that you do not need to use your investment principal. Continue to maintain the annual borrowing and use the loan to cover some expenses, so that your investment portfolio can continue to grow.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: The US government has a very complete retirement plan. In contrast, Taiwan has a big gap in guaranteeing its people&rsquo;s retirement. Taiwan&rsquo;s labor insurance retirement account requires employers to set aside 6% of employees&rsquo; salaries in accordance with the law, and employees can choose to self-allocate 0% to 6% of their salaries. When Ling first started working, there was only the 6% set aside by the employer. Later, following the advice of colleagues, she chose to self-allocate 6% to increase retirement savings and deduct income tax.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: There is no need to participate, because Taiwan&rsquo;s securities accounts are tax-free.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: After listening to James&rsquo;s concept of investing in QQQ in November last year, Ling decided to change the self-allocated portion to 0% and use all the funds for investing in QQQ. In addition, Ling&rsquo;s company provides two options, &ldquo;employee stock trust&rdquo; and &ldquo;employee savings trust,&rdquo; aimed at helping employees increase retirement funds. Previously, she did not know enough and chose the &ldquo;employee stock trust&rdquo; investing in company stocks, but the return in the past six years was only about 38%. If she had followed James&rsquo;s QQQ investment philosophy, the performance might be higher. Therefore, she has recently made adjustments and has chosen the &ldquo;employee savings trust&rdquo; starting this year. However, the investment targets of this &ldquo;employee savings trust&rdquo; are limited and cannot be directly invested in QQQ. Only funds can be chosen. Currently, Ling plans to invest the company&rsquo;s portion in US technology funds and the self-allocated portion in Taiwan stock funds. Although the monthly investment amount is not large, Ling believes it still needs to be further optimized.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Taiwan&rsquo;s securities accounts are tax-free, which is equivalent to the US Roth IRA, and there is no contribution limit, which is a very big advantage. Therefore, Taiwanese investors can directly use their own securities accounts for investments, especially in index funds such as QQQ, and do not need to participate in any retirement plans of the government or companies. These plans often have various restrictions, and the performance may not be good either. Taiwanese investors should take full advantage of this and invest funds directly into their securities accounts to enjoy tax-free investment income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 3</strong>: Since November last year, Ling has watched all of James&rsquo;s videos before 2024 and continues to learn from the following videos. Ling compares investing in QQQ to a &ldquo;big pool.&rdquo; As soon as funds become available, she immediately puts them in, and regards it as her &ldquo;real estate.&rdquo; This &ldquo;big pool&rdquo; will continue to grow over time and is safer than traditional real estate. There is no need to worry about risks such as earthquakes, windstorms, or floods. When money is needed, she borrows through asset pledging to obtain funds instead of selling assets.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Taiwan&rsquo;s financial environment is very friendly. In addition to tax-free securities accounts, the interest on asset-backed loans is also very low, which is an advantage that other regions cannot compare. Taiwanese investors should take full advantage of these &ldquo;free bullets&rdquo; and &ldquo;sophisticated weapons,&rdquo; do a good job in asset allocation, and the future wealth growth potential is huge. Regarding pledging, there is no need to wait until assets reach 10 million TWD to start. It can be decided based on your own circumstances and knowledge of assets. Even with only 2 million TWD of assets, you can try pledging to borrow a small amount of money each year (for example, 40,000 TWD) for use. As experience accumulates and assets grow, the borrowing amount can gradually be increased.</li>

The original intention of creating this group was to find more like-minded people to discuss investments, especially about 00662 (Yuanta Baoshu Shenzhen) and James&rsquo;s investment philosophy. Currently, this group has developed into a learning community of more than 500 people.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: He mentioned that he is also facing a situation where his family does not understand his investment methods. For example, his father would question why he doesn&rsquo;t sell at high points but chooses to hold for the long term. In order to make his family better understand his investment philosophy, he invited his family to join the Line group he created, hoping that through the discussions within the group, his family could understand the advantages and value of long-term investment and reduce their concerns.</li>

All sharing will be done on public platforms to ensure transparency and fairness of information.

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He went hiking with a friend, who is also a member of CLEC. The two talked about the recent layoffs at Google due to AI development. This triggered their thinking about the future development of AI, especially whether AI will threaten humans due to its own &ldquo;rationality,&rdquo; for example, whether AI will deliberately leave bugs in its programs to avoid being shut down by humans.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What is the future development direction of AI? What impact will it have on human work? In particular, will AI develop self-awareness and threaten humans?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: The development of AI will have a huge impact on the job market. In the future, most people will face the risk of unemployment, and only a few capitalists and those who can control AI will be able to survive. Therefore, everyone should start learning and mastering AI tools now, and use them as assistants to improve work efficiency. At the same time, every country should pay attention to the development of AI, especially a comprehensive AI strategy. Currently, the United States and China are at the forefront in this area, while Europe and Taiwan are relatively lagging behind. If Taiwan wants to remain competitive in the AI era, it needs to significantly increase the salary levels of engineers and increase the TWD exchange rate to attract top talent from around the world. As for whether AI will develop self-awareness and threaten humans, this is indeed a concern. In the future, there may be a confrontation between &ldquo;righteous AI&rdquo; and &ldquo;villainous AI,&rdquo; just like in the movie &ldquo;The Matrix.&rdquo; This is also one of the reasons why Elon Musk is committed to developing more powerful AI and trying to guide it toward goodness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How does James view the practice of restricting certain countries from accessing certain advanced technologies (such as AI)? Is this a form of discrimination?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: This is a complex issue that can be discussed publicly, but it is necessary to avoid political stances and remain objective and rational. Efforts should be made to make information public and transparent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What is China&rsquo;s current asset situation? In addition, what impact does AI have on the stock markets of various countries?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Every country has its own problems. China&rsquo;s data is not completely transparent, and it is difficult to obtain accurate information. Currently, AI has the most significant impact on the stock markets of the United States and Taiwan, while other countries are relatively less affected.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: James previously suggested keeping cash in an IRA account rather than a Brokerage Account. Why is that?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Because the capital gains in the SEP IRA account also needs to be taxed, in order to avoid its rapid growth, it is recommended to keep your existing funds in your SEP IRA account as is and no longer contribute to it. The funds in the Brokerage Account can be used for asset-backed loans. You can continue to use the annual quota to deposit funds into your SEP IRA and then transfer it to a ROTH IRA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Do I need to keep some cash in my Brokerage Account?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: No, you do not. You can obtain emergency funds through asset-backed loans. For example, if you have $5 million in Brokerage Account assets, you can obtain a credit line of approximately $3.5 million, which is sufficient to deal with most emergencies. You can first apply to open the asset-backed loan function, even if you don&rsquo;t use it for the time being. When you need money, you can borrow from it at any time, for example, occasionally borrowing $100,000 to pay taxes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: You always emphasize that QQQ should &ldquo;never be sold.&rdquo; So should QLD or TQQQ in a Roth IRA account also &ldquo;never be sold?&rdquo; But doesn&rsquo;t TQQQ have various fees and losses?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Yes, even QLD and TQQQ should be held for the long term and not bought and sold frequently. Although TQQQ has some management fees and fluctuation losses, these losses are acceptable in the long term considering its huge growth potential. We should focus on long-term results rather than short-term fluctuations. For example, if QQQ increases 200 times in 40 years, then TQQQ may increase 600 times, which is a very substantial return.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 4</strong>: In a Roth IRA account, if I don’t buy QLD, can I buy TQQQ?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: I don’t give specific investment advice. Whether to buy TQQQ is your own choice. I can only tell you that the data we use for backtesting is based on QQQ. If you change the volatility, I will not be able to answer the questions you may encounter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 5</strong>: For a child&rsquo;s Roth IRA account, do you recommend buying QLD or QQQ?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: For children’s accounts, regardless of the account type, as long as the investment period is long enough, for example, 40 years, it is okay to consider investing in QLD as much as possible to maximize tax-free gains.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He used James&rsquo;s 433 asset allocation simulator to verify his investment logic and made adjustments according to his own circumstances. His current asset allocation is 80/20 (80% QQQ, 20% TQQQ). He plans to gradually transition to 40/30 (40% QQQ, 30% TQQQ, 30% cash) after retirement. He also shared his work experience in the AI field, mainly responsible for AI applications in power systems. He agrees with James&rsquo;s view that AI will eventually replace most human jobs, but some jobs are still difficult to replace in the short term, such as the construction industry. He also mentioned that the degree of demand for AI varies from region to region due to differences in labor costs. Finally, he shared that he would choose to stay in better hotels when he travels for business to enjoy life, rather than just saving money.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: In the process of market uptrend, your cash ratio must be greater than your liabilities. This is the most important principle. The 433 asset allocation has been verified by backtesting and can cope with the worst market conditions. If you cannot achieve the 433 allocation for the time being, you must at least ensure that the cash ratio is higher than your liabilities. At the same time, you can re-allocate your new capital each month. Regarding AI, although AI will eventually replace most jobs, some jobs are still difficult to replace in the short term. For example, the construction industry still requires a lot of physical labor, and AI cannot completely replace it in the short term.</li>

After a period of reflection, he gradually understood the logic behind these concepts.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: At this stage, you can spend more money appropriately and enjoy life. The key is to learn to borrow money for consumption, rather than spending your own money. Investing and consumption are not contradictory; the important thing is to master the methods. For example, you can choose to take a taxi instead of spending time waiting for a bus. You can choose to spend money to buy a better car and enjoy a better driving experience, as long as you don’t spend your own money but pay through loans or other means. In 40 years, you will have 80 billion. Now, what you should be thinking about is how to spend money, not how to save money.</li>

<p>There are many walls in the world, but people inside the walls don’t know they are within the walls, because everyone thinks they are free and open-minded. Many who think they are outside the walls don’t know that they are inside the walls.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>The information filter bubble effect in the online world should make us realize that the world we perceive may not be the real world, and we should maintain an open mind. Everyone and every country has its own information barriers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The least guaranteed are laborers, and the second least guaranteed is real estate.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Laborers face the risk of unemployment, especially in the current era of rapid AI development. Real estate also has risks, such as natural disasters and market fluctuations. In comparison, the risk of long-term investing in quality stock assets (such as QQQ) is lower.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All laborers, regardless of whether you are young or old, remember that now artificial intelligence is sweeping the world, you will face unemployment.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>The development of AI will have a huge impact on the job market, and a large number of jobs will be replaced by AI. This is both a challenge and an opportunity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the future, the future will be left with very few capitalists and very few people who know how to control AI; the rest will be useless laborers.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>The social structure of the future will undergo tremendous changes, and you must become a capitalist or someone who can control AI. This means we need to continuously learn and master new skills in order to stand firm in the future society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to have a purpose in life, we don&rsquo;t need to do anything in life, we just need to be happy.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Encourage everyone to enjoy life and not set too many goals and pressures for themselves. The meaning of life lies in experiencing and feeling, rather than pursuing material wealth or social status.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don&rsquo;t necessarily have to like capitalist society, but we need to know how it makes money. We must stand on the same side as it, and then we can make a lot of money.
&ndash; Cat</p></blockquote>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to like capitalism, but we need to understand the rules of capitalism in order to profit from it. Only by understanding how capitalism works can we better use it to achieve our wealth goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I still criticize, it means I still care.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>The criticism of Taiwan is because of the love for this land and the hope that it will become better.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market fluctuations, international situations, market analysis, financial statements, economic situations, etc., are irrelevant to individual investment returns.</strong> Teacher James emphasizes that these factors are often overhyped by the media and financial institutions but have minimal impact on long-term investors&rsquo; returns. Investors should focus on long-term trends rather than short-term fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Investors should avoid being influenced by market noise and news.</strong> Misleading information in the market can easily lead investors to make wrong decisions. In the long run, these short-term fluctuations are offset by the market&rsquo;s long-term growth trend.</li>
<li><strong>Investment should be based on a strategy of long-term holding of the Nasdaq 100 index fund, without frequent trading.</strong> Frequent trading not only generates high transaction costs but also increases investment risk. The long-term holding strategy can reduce risks and enjoy the benefits of compound interest.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The risk of leveraged investing is lower than that of non-leveraged investing.</strong> Teacher James explains that those who use leverage have more cash reserves in times of crisis, making them more resilient than those without cash reserves. The key is whether the borrowed money is invested in the right assets, such as stocks of high-quality companies.</li>
<li><strong>Investors are advised to borrow early and incorporate the funds into their asset allocation.</strong> Early borrowing allows funds to be invested in the market, enjoying longer compound interest growth. Even keeping the borrowed money as a backup is safer than not being able to obtain a loan when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Newly listed funds have larger tracking errors; it is recommended to invest in established funds.</strong> Newly listed funds, due to their smaller size, require more hedging operations, resulting in larger tracking errors that affect investment returns. It is advisable to choose established funds like 00662, which have larger scale and smaller tracking errors.</li>
<li><strong>Asset allocation should be based on individual circumstances, such as the 433 or 442 strategies, with intelligent rebalancing.</strong> The 433 strategy refers to 40% core fund (e.g., QQQ), 30% leveraged fund (e.g., QLD), and 30% cash. The 442 strategy refers to 40% core fund, 40% leveraged fund, and 20% cash. Intelligent rebalancing involves transferring a portion of the profits from the leveraged fund to cash in rising years and transferring a portion of cash to the leveraged fund in declining years.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing should not exceed a certain percentage of total assets and should be combined with asset allocation to achieve automatic navigation.</strong> The amount of new borrowing each year can be gradually increased. For example, in the first year, you can borrow 1%-2% of the total assets, and then increase it slightly each year. The specific proportion depends on the individual&rsquo;s debt tolerance. In the long-term investment process, total assets grow at a rate of more than 10% per year, while debt grows at a rate of 2% per year. Therefore, borrowing money is very safe in the long run. Through intelligent rebalancing, the automatic navigation of the investment portfolio can be achieved without frequent adjustments.</li>
<li><strong>Investors should be extremely optimistic.</strong> Regardless of any disasters or market downturns, investors should remain optimistic because the market will eventually rise and break new highs.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Real estate is a high-risk asset, subject to risks such as windstorms, floods, earthquakes, and fires.</strong> In the United States, in addition to the above risks, there are also risks of tornadoes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters. These disasters can lead to significant depreciation or even complete loss of property value.</li>
<li><strong>In contrast, the Nasdaq 100 index fund includes 100 companies, does not require payment of taxes, maintenance fees, insurance fees, and is not affected by natural disasters.</strong> These 100 companies are among the best in the United States and even globally, with high long-term investment returns.</li>
<li><strong>It is recommended to transfer the risk of real estate to the landlord by renting instead of owning property to avoid risks.</strong> Owning property requires various maintenance costs, taxes, and risks from natural disasters. Renting can transfer these risks to the landlord, and you only need to pay rent.</li>

<li><strong>Investment should control emotions, understand history, and look at the present from the future.</strong> Investing requires rationality, avoiding emotional decisions. By understanding historical market fluctuations and economic cycles, one can better grasp investment opportunities. Looking at the present from the future can strengthen confidence in long-term investment.</li>
<li><strong>The value of the Nasdaq 100 index fund will far exceed its current value in the future, and long-term holding will bring substantial returns.</strong> With the advancement of technology and economic development, the value of the Nasdaq 100 index fund will continue to grow.</li>
<li><strong>The most important goal in life is to fulfill one&rsquo;s mission, not to pursue money, fame, and power.</strong> Money is only a tool to achieve life goals, not the goal itself. One should consider how to use wealth to realize one&rsquo;s life values.</li>
<li><strong>Money is a tool, and one should learn to spend money, especially for wealthy retirees; spending money is a virtue.</strong> Retirees should learn to enjoy life and use their wealth to improve their quality of life and achieve their life goals. At the same time, spending money can promote economic flow and create more opportunities for young people.</li>
<li><strong>Elderly people who have retired and are very wealthy should spend money as a moral duty.</strong> Spending money can stimulate the economy, allowing young people to earn more, and they may also consider having children and getting married.</li>

<li><strong>Invest in the US Nasdaq 100 index fund because the US is the source of the world&rsquo;s strongest currency and innovative technology.</strong> The United States has strong economic strength and innovation capabilities. In the long run, investing in the US market has a high potential for return.</li>
<li><strong>In addition to listening to the opinions of Buffett and Peter Lynch, one should also learn from the experiences of failures.</strong> By learning from the lessons of failures, one can avoid making the same mistakes and improve the probability of investment success.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>In capitalism, if you have money, buy index funds, and you will become rich.</strong> In a capitalist society, investment is an important way to achieve wealth growth. Due to their diversified investment characteristics, index funds can reduce risks and obtain average market returns.</li>
<li><strong>To become a millionaire, one needs to understand borrowing.</strong> Moderate borrowing can amplify investment returns and accelerate wealth accumulation. However, it should be noted that borrowing must be based on safety and controllability.</li>
<li><strong>Real estate loans require repayment of principal and interest, and retirees should avoid such loans.</strong> The income source of retirees is usually relatively fixed, and the pressure to repay principal and interest is greater, which may affect the quality of life.</li>
<li><strong>Convert mortgages to home equity lines of credit to reduce monthly expenses.</strong> Home equity lines of credit only require interest payments, not principal repayment, which can reduce monthly repayment pressure.</li>
<li><strong>The US borrows money to develop its domestic investment economy.</strong> The US can borrow a little more money and repay it in 20 or 30 years. In fact, the US does not want to repay the debt. It borrows new debt to repay old debt. The money is never repaid, and the currency will depreciate.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing without principal repayment is acceptable.</strong> Suppose you have 30 million in retirement savings, at 2%, you can spend 600,000 a year, or 50,000 a month.</li>

<li>Question: Details of the 433 asset allocation strategy, especially the specific steps for rebalancing at the end of the year, and how to understand the concept of &ldquo;automatic navigation.&rdquo; Many students are confused about how to readjust the asset allocation back to the 433 ratio.</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: When rebalancing at the end of the year, <strong>only the leveraged fund (Q2D) and cash portions need to be adjusted, without touching the core fund (QQQ)</strong>.
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>In a rising year</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the annual return of Q2D (year-end asset - beginning-year asset). If there were additional investments during the year, subtract the amount of additional investments.</li>
<li>Transfer 1/3 of the annual return of Q2D to the cash account.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In a declining year</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate 2% of the total assets.</li>
<li>Transfer 2% of the total assets from the cash account to the Q2D account.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatic navigation</strong> means that once the initial asset allocation and annual intelligent rebalancing are completed, there is no need to frequently monitor or adjust the asset ratio, allowing the investment portfolio to operate automatically according to the preset strategy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Share: Pin shared a book called &ldquo;Die with Zero,&rdquo; which puts forward a novel point of view: <strong>every meaningful experience in life is an investment, similar to financial investment. These experiences can bring spiritual returns, and these returns will increase over time.</strong> The book compares this kind of experience investment to financial investment. Every positive experience is like depositing the &ldquo;principal&rdquo; into the memory bank. Every time you recall or share these experiences afterward, you can get &ldquo;interest&rdquo;—happiness and satisfaction. As we age, these memories become more and more precious, just like compound interest in financial investment, whose value continues to grow. Pin took herself as an example. She decided to quit her job to accompany her elderly parents. Although this was a difficult decision financially, she regarded this experience as a valuable investment, and its return would far exceed the loss of money.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment: Teacher James agreed with Pin&rsquo;s sharing and further explained that <strong>the purpose of life is to convert material energy into spiritual energy</strong>. Money is just a tool. The real purpose is to obtain spiritual satisfaction and happiness. We should use money to create beautiful experiences, not just accumulate numbers. He took a chart in the &ldquo;One Billion Investment Lecture&rdquo; as an example to illustrate how to convert material energy into spiritual energy and emphasized that ultimately we should pursue spiritual abundance.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Three years ago, she mortgaged a house and borrowed 10 million NTD in a home equity line of credit, but this money has not been used. Now she has some concerns. After these three years, she wonders if she should be braver and use this money, but she is worried about her nervous personality.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James believes that Sunny&rsquo;s personality is too nervous and not suitable for complex investment operations. And pointed out that if you have a nervous personality, you are not suitable for investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Previously, she listened to some suggestions in the market and bought a large number of 20-year long-term bonds, resulting in a relatively high proportion of bonds in the current investment portfolio, and it is currently in a state of loss. Now that the market trend has changed and she is facing losses, how should she deal with this bond investment?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James pointed out that Sunny should not invest in long-term bonds and emphasized that funds should be concentrated on assets that can make money. He suggested that Sunny watch investment course videos to learn the correct investment strategy instead of blindly following various suggestions in the market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: Should she sell all the bonds now and transfer all the proceeds to buy QQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Considering that Sunny is retired and has a fixed monthly pension, it is recommended that she reallocate all assets (including bonds, cash, etc.), invest 80% of the assets in 00662 (Taiwan ETF tracking the Nasdaq 100 Index), and invest 20% of the assets in 00864B (Taiwan&rsquo;s short-term bond ETF, equivalent to cash).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 4: She still has 20-30% cash on hand. Should these cash continue to be invested in 00662 and 00864B according to the 80/20 ratio?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James আবারও emphasized that all assets need to be added up for calculation to ensure that the final investment ratio of 00662 is 80% and the investment ratio of 00864B is 20%. If the cash ratio is insufficient, she may need to sell some bonds to increase the cash ratio.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s additional explanation: Teacher James emphasized the importance of investment education and suggested that Sunny spend time watching course videos to systematically learn investment knowledge instead of just seeking a simple answer. He pointed out that there is no shortcut to investment and it takes time and energy to learn and understand.</li>

<li>Question 1: When transferring a 401k account from one institution to another (TIAA), TIAA charged a 0.3% account management fee. He asked whether this fee was reasonable and whether it was too high.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James believes that the 0.3% management fee is reasonable and not too high. When conducting account transfers, such fees are normal and are necessary expenses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Does the asset allocation strategy mentioned earlier include all types of assets, such as retirement accounts (such as 401k), real estate, etc.?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James clearly pointed out that the asset allocation strategy only includes liquid assets, that is, assets that can be easily bought and sold, such as 401k, IRA, personal brokerage accounts (which can buy and sell stocks, funds, ETFs, etc.). Real estate is not a liquid asset, so it is not included in the scope of asset allocation.</li>

<li>Share: Zhang Yong shared his deep understanding of Teacher James&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;wealth is a talent, and happiness is a human right.&rdquo; He found that in reality, many people&rsquo;s behaviors are contrary to this concept, based on his work and life experience. He realized that many people, including himself, are misled by the traditional financial system and engage in unreasonable financial behaviors such as forced savings. He believes that Teacher James&rsquo;s course system and philosophy are truthful and can help people achieve financial freedom.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment: Teacher James agreed with Zhang Yong&rsquo;s sharing and further explained the essence of the capitalist system and financial system. He pointed out that the history of the development of capitalism, especially after the Industrial Revolution, led to the emergence of the working class and gradually evolved into an invisible &ldquo;slavery&rdquo; system. The government, financial institutions, and capitalists have jointly built a &ldquo;Truman&rsquo;s World&rdquo; where most people live according to a set script without realizing it. Teacher James used the movie &ldquo;The Truman Show&rdquo; as an example to point out that this &ldquo;script&rdquo; was jointly set by capitalists, the government, and financial institutions to make most people become laborers and serve the capitalist system. Most people, including senior executives in the financial industry, do not even realize that they are &ldquo;actors&rdquo; in this system. Only a few people can see the truth and achieve true financial freedom. Teacher James emphasized that the purpose of his course is to help everyone recognize the existence of this &ldquo;scam&rdquo; and find ways to achieve financial freedom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: Many people are busy working and living, but their behaviors and ideas are contrary to the concept of achieving financial freedom. Most people seem to be misled by the traditional financial system and make unreasonable financial plans. Zhang Yong wants to know the essential reasons for this widespread phenomenon and how to change this situation.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James explained that the root cause of this phenomenon is the capitalist system itself. Since the Industrial Revolution, the capitalist system has gradually turned most people into laborers and built a complete system to maintain this state. This system instills the concepts of &ldquo;work hard, save, and invest&rdquo; in people through multiple channels such as education, media, and financial institutions, but in fact, it is &ldquo;enslaving&rdquo; most people. He pointed out that this is a &ldquo;war without sound and breath&rdquo; and most people do not realize that they are in it. Teacher James believes that to change this situation, we must first recognize the existence of this &ldquo;scam&rdquo;, and then gradually achieve financial freedom by learning the correct investment concepts and methods. He emphasized that we cannot change the entire system, but we can change ourselves and let ourselves and our families live a better life.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Tina has currently invested most of her assets in 00662 (Taiwan) and NDQ (Australia) ETFs, and plans to transfer her Australian retirement fund to NDQ in the future. She asked whether she should conduct asset allocation after completing all investments or start considering the allocation of other assets now.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James suggested that Tina conduct asset allocation as soon as possible, rather than considering it after all funds are invested in specific assets. He believes that asset allocation should be a quick decision-making process that can be completed within a day. For those who have not retired and have not borrowed money, they can choose the 433 or 442 asset allocation strategy; for those who are close to retirement or have retired, they should use the 80/20 asset allocation strategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: If according to the 442 strategy, Tina has allocated 40% of her assets to 00662 and NDQ, then after transferring the Australian retirement fund next month, should she invest in 00670L (Taiwan&rsquo;s leveraged ETF)? If the funds are kept in Australia, how should they be allocated?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James suggested that Tina treat the Australian retirement fund as a cash portion and allocate it according to tax factors. If in Australia, since the dividends of NDQ need to be taxed and the tax rate is high, it is not recommended to invest all retirement funds in NDQ. The Australian retirement fund can be used as a cash reserve, while the core fund (such as 00662) is allocated in Taiwan. If the cash reserve in Australia is not enough to meet the proportion of asset allocation, a portion of the funds can be remitted from Taiwan to Australia. He suggested that Tina consider tax factors and decide the specific asset allocation ratio according to her place of residence and post-retirement life arrangements.</li>

<li>Question: Wen Zhang&rsquo;s younger sister invested in a fund in Canada that tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index. The fund has a high management fee of 2.95% but promises to return 75% of the principal if the Nasdaq 100 Index falls. Wen Zhang&rsquo;s younger sister is worried that she cannot control her investment behavior and may buy and sell frequently, so she is interested in this high-management-fee but guaranteed fund. Wen Zhang wants to know Teacher James&rsquo;s opinion on this fund and whether there are better investment options.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James first pointed out that if investors cannot control their investment behavior, then investing in any product may face risks. He believes that the investor&rsquo;s mentality and self-control are the key factors for investment success. Regarding specific investment advice, Teacher James suggested investing in the Canadian version of QQQ, such as QQC or XQQ. These ETFs directly track the Nasdaq 100 Index, have lower management fees, and have higher long-term investment returns. However, Teacher James also emphasized that the final investment choice should be based on the investor&rsquo;s risk tolerance and investment experience. If Wen Zhang&rsquo;s younger sister cannot overcome the impulse to buy and sell frequently, then any investment advice may be invalid.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: Jenny does not have much money in her Roth IRA because her income is too high to contribute directly. She currently faces a higher tax rate and is considering whether she should convert all the funds deposited in her Traditional IRA (up to $7,000 per year) to a Roth IRA, even if she needs to pay higher taxes.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James thinks this is a good idea. Since Jenny&rsquo;s Traditional IRA amount is already large, she will face a higher tax rate when withdrawing in the future. By converting funds to a Roth IRA, she can enjoy future tax-free growth. He suggested that Jenny make the conversion, even if she needs to pay taxes now, but it is worthwhile in the long run.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: In addition to the annual limit of $7,000, can more be converted?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Yes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additional explanation: Teacher James further explained why a Roth IRA is needed. He suggested buying leveraged funds (such as QLD) in the Roth IRA and allocating an equivalent amount of cash in the Traditional IRA or other taxable accounts. This can reduce the growth rate of the Traditional IRA, thereby reducing future tax burdens. For example, if there is $500,000 of QLD in the Roth IRA, then $500,000 of cash can be allocated in the Traditional IRA. As the Roth IRA grows, the cash allocation in the Traditional IRA can be increased accordingly.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: Julie observed that the recent volatility of QQQ is relatively large, with daily gains and losses often exceeding 1%. She wants to know the reasons behind this phenomenon and whether this high volatility will continue in the future. She believes that the volatility of QQQ in previous years was relatively small, and there would not be such large daily gains and losses unless there were major events.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James first pointed out that Julie&rsquo;s observation has a &ldquo;recency bias&rdquo;, that is, people tend to pay too much attention to recent events while ignoring long-term trends. He showed the long-term trend chart of QQQ (including linear and logarithmic charts) to illustrate that in the long run, the volatility of QQQ has not increased significantly. The recent large fluctuations are because the price of QQQ has risen to a higher level, so even a 1% fluctuation is larger in absolute terms than in the past. Teacher James emphasized that a logarithmic chart should be used to observe long-term trends because the logarithmic chart can more accurately reflect the magnitude of asset price fluctuations.</li>

<li>Share: Houqi shared the investment experience of a friend. This friend started participating in the company&rsquo;s 401k plan when he was young, but he didn&rsquo;t pay much attention at first, just investing according to the company&rsquo;s match. Many years later, he was surprised to find that his 401k account had accumulated more than one million US dollars in assets. This case illustrates the power of compound interest. Even small regular investments can generate huge returns after a long period of accumulation.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment: Teacher James agreed with Houqi&rsquo;s sharing and further explained the power of compound interest. He took the US 401k plan as an example, assuming an annual investment of 20,000 US dollars, calculated at a 14% annualized rate of return, it can accumulate to 30 million US dollars after 40 years. Even if calculated at a lower 10% annualized rate of return in the past, it can also accumulate to 9 million US dollars. This example illustrates that long-term investment and compound interest are the key factors for achieving wealth growth.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>People who borrow money are the ones with lower risks, and people who do not borrow money have extremely high risks.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Because people with cash reserves can use funds immediately in an emergency, while those without cash reserves may face the risk of a broken capital chain. Those who have loans have more cash reserves in the face of crises and have stronger risk resistance than those who do not have cash reserves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A house is a consumer product. It is a kind of money-eating support, not an investment, and it is a very high-risk support.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This sentence emphasizes the attribute of real estate as a consumer product rather than an investment product, as well as its potential high risks, including natural disasters and maintenance costs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To succeed in investing, you must control your emotions. The first thing is to control your emotions. If you cannot control your emotions, please do not invest.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasizes the importance of emotional control in investing. Investing requires rationality, avoiding emotional decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In capitalism, if you have money, buy index funds, and you will become rich.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasizes that in a capitalist society, long-term investment in index funds is an effective way to achieve wealth growth. Due to their diversified investment characteristics, index funds can reduce risks and obtain average market returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to recognize that real estate is a high-risk support, so it is very strange that everyone thinks that directly investing in 100 companies is very risky, but buying a house with all their assets is also very special.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view challenges people&rsquo;s general perception of real estate as a safe asset. Real estate is a high-risk asset with risks such as windstorms, floods, earthquakes, and fires.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have been speculating, then you will go bankrupt in this market. There is no need to say that if you do too much, you will go bankrupt.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This sentence warns of the risks of speculative behavior and emphasizes the importance of long-term investment. Frequent trading not only generates high transaction costs but also increases investment risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Money is not our purpose. Money is not our purpose. The whole experience of life requires money. That is our purpose.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This sentence emphasizes the essence of money as a tool, and the real purpose of life is experience and spiritual satisfaction. We should use money to create a better experience, not just accumulate numbers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All passers-by, all the dogma of the financial industry are deceiving you.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Criticism of the traditional financial system and dogma. Only you don&rsquo;t know. Capitalists know it, politicians know it, but only the workers don&rsquo;t know it. 99.99% of the workers think that they are living in reality and in a real environment. In fact, you are living in a scripted life without knowing it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you start working today, then you can borrow $20,000 every year. Then how much more will you have? You will have an extra $30 million.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view quantifies the huge impact of leveraged investing on wealth growth. Moderate borrowing can amplify investment returns and accelerate wealth accumulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the power of compound interest, and let me give you an example. In the United States, 401K is $20,000. Suppose you invest $20,000 every year when you are young. With an annualized rate of return of 14%, in 40 years, you will have $30 million. You just invest without doing anything.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view reveals the great power of compound interest in long-term investment. Even a small amount of money can accumulate into amazing wealth through long-term compound interest growth.</p>

<p>Many of us spend our entire lives struggling with money, working tirelessly for monthly bills, children&rsquo;s tuition, and meager retirement savings, like a hamster trapped in a cage, running hard but never escaping. Have you ever considered that you could have been richer? Have you ever thought that the sense of security you seek actually binds you, causing you to miss out on greater wealth?</p>
<p>Yes, everyone has an innate talent for wealth, a right we are born with, as natural as breathing, as natural as birds flying and fish swimming. Unfortunately, this right, this talent, has been forgotten, or even buried by our own hands through the &ldquo;education&rdquo; of reality and the &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; of society. From a young age, we are told: study hard, find a good job, work hard to earn money to support the family. No one tells us: you can be very rich, you have the right to be very rich, you don&rsquo;t even have to work so hard to have it all!</p>
<p>The value of this lecture is far more than teaching you one or two investment techniques; its true value lies in awakening you from that “hamster dilemma,” making you realize your dormant wealth potential, and showing you a path to financial freedom. This path does not require you to have Einstein&rsquo;s brain, nor does it require you to have Buffett&rsquo;s luck, it only requires you to change your mindset, and then, to move forward steadfastly.</p>

<p>The extent of your vision dictates the height of your wealth. This isn&rsquo;t just some motivational slogan; it&rsquo;s a conclusion derived from rigorous logic and data analysis. Don&rsquo;t believe it? Let&rsquo;s crunch some numbers.</p>
<p>Many people find investing for something decades into the future to be too distant and unrealistic. But what if we look 60 years into the future? If you have 1 million now, through sensible investments and factoring in the power of compounding, you could have assets worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in a few decades. This is entirely possible; it’s actually a conservative estimate.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t ordinary people realize they can have so much wealth? The reason is simple: our concept of money is too narrow, we have insufficient understanding of our potential, and we lack a deep understanding of compounding, the &ldquo;eighth wonder of the world!&rdquo; Our understanding of money is still at the kindergarten level, while financial giants have a Ph.D.-level understanding of money, at least.</p>

<p>Why is it so hard for most salaried workers to escape the &ldquo;rat race&rdquo; dilemma? Because they are trapped in a carefully designed cycle: you work hard for a month, and before the paycheck even warms up, it has to go to capitalists, the government, and the bank. For that meager salary, you have to work like a rat running tirelessly in a cage, never escaping that vicious circle.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that society constantly brainwashes you with &ldquo;consumerism,&rdquo; telling you that buying big houses, luxury cars, and branded bags is the standard for successful people. So, you&rsquo;re burdened with heavy loans, barely able to breathe under the weight of monthly interest payments. You don&rsquo;t dare to quit your job easily, and you don&rsquo;t dare to challenge your boss. You become a complete slave to capital.</p>
<p>Do you think this is your own choice? Do you think it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re not working hard enough? No! This is a structure intentionally or unintentionally maintained by the entire society and education system. What do schools cultivate? Compliant cogs in a machine, not independent-thinking creators. Financial institutions design complex financial products, ostensibly to help you manage your money, but in reality? They earn high fees and interest, while you can&rsquo;t even outpace inflation.</p>
<p>This “controlled environment” prevents you from realizing your potential for wealth, let alone changing your situation. You are like that hamster in the fable, the faster you run, the further you get from freedom.</p>

<p>Poverty is not your fault; it is the result of social structures that create class inequality. This structural inequality is like a thick curtain that obscures your innate talent for wealth, making you believe that you can only live a poor or middle-class life.</p>
<p>The statement &ldquo;wealth is a talent&rdquo; is not just a platitude, but a declaration, a solemn proclamation of your right!

<p>But remember, money itself is not the goal, but a means to achieve our life goals. We make money not to become slaves to it, but to live better, to realize our own dreams and those of our families, to have the ability to help those in need, and to better serve society.</p>

<p>Can ordinary people really achieve financial freedom? The answer is: of course they can! Moreover, achieving financial freedom is much simpler than you imagine.</p>
<p>The key to financial freedom is not about having a high IQ, or mastering complex techniques, but rather whether you have the correct investment mindset and whether you can persevere in executing it.</p>
<p>The path to financial freedom for ordinary people is actually very simple: choose the right investment vehicle, hold it for the long term, and let the power of compounding increase your wealth like a snowball. Specifically, it&rsquo;s recommended to invest in the U.S. Nasdaq 100 index fund, a relatively low-risk investment choice with excellent long-term performance. In the long run, its annualized return is considerable.</p>
<p>Many people might say, investing in index funds, isn&rsquo;t that something even an idiot can do? Yes, it&rsquo;s that simple! But the problem is, how many people can truly hold on for the long term?</p>
<p>Financial freedom is not achieved overnight; it requires patience and perseverance. In the course of investing, you will encounter all sorts of challenges and temptations, but as long as you believe in your choice and continue steadfastly, you will surely reach the other shore.</p>

<p>The biggest characteristic of the &ldquo;poor mindset&rdquo; is self-limitation. They habitually limit themselves with &ldquo;impossible,&rdquo; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; and &ldquo;too difficult.&rdquo; They don&rsquo;t see their potential or the hope for the future.</p>
<p>The key to shedding the &ldquo;poor mindset&rdquo; lies in changing your mindset and recognizing your wealth potential and rights. You have to believe that poverty is not your destiny, and that you have the ability to change your fate.</p>
<p>Specifically, you need to learn the right investment knowledge, rather than being led by so-called financial experts or the media. You need to understand that true wealth comes from long-term investment, not short-term speculation or blind consumption. You need to learn to delay gratification, using the money you save for investment, rather than for buying things that are non-essential.</p>
<p>More importantly, you need to cultivate the ability to think independently, not to be swayed by others or blindly follow trends. You need to develop an investment plan suitable for your own circumstances, and then steadfastly execute it.</p>
<p>Finally, you must remember that financial freedom is not something that happens overnight; it requires patience and perseverance, believing in the power of compounding, and adhering to long-term investment.</p>

<p>Why invest? The answer is simple: to make money work for us, not us for money.</p>
<p>Through investing, we can make our money grow continuously in the capital markets, thus realizing an increase in wealth. This increase can help us withstand inflation, ensure our future quality of life, and ultimately achieve financial freedom, so we no longer have to toil for a living.</p>
<p>Investing is also a way to plan for and secure the future. Through investment, we can accumulate funds for retirement, prepare for our children&rsquo;s education, and create conditions for realizing our dreams. Imagine, when you retire, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about whether your pension is enough, you can travel the world freely, do things you love, what a wonderful life that would be!</p>
<p>In addition, investing is also a way to participate in economic development. By investing in excellent companies, we can share the dividends of their growth, and also create value for society, promoting social progress.</p>

</h3>
<p>Why is it better to start investing early? The answer lies in the word &ldquo;compounding.&rdquo; Compounding, which Einstein called the &ldquo;eighth wonder of the world,&rdquo; is more powerful than you think.</p>
<p>For example, if we calculate with a 12% annual rate of return (a figure that can be achieved over the long term), a 30-year-old who invests $283 per month can accumulate approximately $1 million by the age of 60. But if they started investing at the age of 20, they would only need to invest $85 per month to reach the same goal!</p>
<p>See that? That is the power of compounding! The earlier you start investing, the less principal you need, and the shorter the time it takes to achieve your wealth goals. Because the effect of compounding causes your wealth to grow like a snowball, the longer the time, the faster the growth rate, and the greater the power.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if you don&rsquo;t have much capital right now, as long as you start investing early and stick with it over the long term, you can accumulate a considerable amount of wealth. Time is the best friend of investment.</p>

<p>Many people think bonds are a stable investment, and some even say they&rsquo;re safer than stocks. Is this really the case?</p>
<p>In the long term, bonds can actually be riskier than stocks. Don&rsquo;t believe it? Let&rsquo;s look at the data. How have different asset classes performed over the past 200 years, from the early 19th century to the early 21st century? The results show that the long-term returns of stocks are far higher than those of bonds, and bonds have sometimes even lost money over periods of 20 or even 30 years!</p>
<p>Why is this the case? Because the yield on bonds is usually low, making it difficult to withstand the erosion of inflation. Moreover, bond prices are affected by interest rate fluctuations and carry some risk. In contrast, although stocks fluctuate more in the short term, they have higher growth potential in the long term.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about real estate. Many people believe that buying a house is the most value-preserving investment, and some even consider their house their most important asset. However, have you ever considered whether real estate is really a good investment?</p>
<p>From an investment perspective, the main problems with real estate are its poor liquidity, high maintenance costs, and unremarkable long-term returns. Imagine if someone spent 10 million Taiwan dollars to build a villa 35 years ago, could that villa be worth 30 million Taiwan dollars 35 years later? It’s unlikely. However, if they had invested that 10 million Taiwan dollars in the stock market, based on historical average returns, the current value would have increased by two orders of magnitude, possibly becoming 1 billion Taiwan dollars!</p>
<p>More importantly, real estate also involves complex factors such as location and market fluctuations, all of which can affect its investment returns, and ordinary people find it difficult to control them.</p>
<p>And what if you treat your home as a place to live? Then you&rsquo;ll be burdened with decades of loan payments, and monthly mortgage repayments will weigh you down. For this house, you have to work hard, not dare to quit easily, and not dare to pursue your dreams, you become a complete “house slave.” Isn&rsquo;t that putting the cart before the horse?</p>
<p>Remember, a home to live in is essentially a consumption, not an investment.</p>

<p>The method of investing in index funds is really simple: choose a good index fund, such as the Nasdaq 100 index fund, and then buy in regularly, holding it for the long term. It&rsquo;s that simple. You don&rsquo;t need a background in finance, nor do you need to monitor the market every day. You can even leave it untouched for years.</p>
<p>But why is it that so few people are actually able to do this simple thing?</p>
<p>First, it requires you to have a long-term perspective and firm conviction. During market fluctuations, especially when the market is down, many people feel panic and anxiety, and even doubt their choice, eventually giving in and selling, and as a result? They often sell at the lowest point, missing out on the rebound that follows.</p>
<p>Second, it requires you to overcome your human weaknesses. In the course of investing, you&rsquo;ll encounter all sorts of temptations: today, this stock has hit its limit up, tomorrow, that concept is hot, the day after tomorrow, experts predict the market will plummet… this noise will interfere with your judgment, leading you to deviate from your original investment plan.</p>
<p>Many people, even those who have learned this simple investment method, still cannot do it well. Some investors are impatient to sell as soon as the market rises slightly, missing out on the big gains that come later; some investors, although they have set a fixed investment plan, are always unable to stick to it, going at it haphazardly; and other investors, because they hold other types of stocks or investments, are unable to make up their minds to switch to index funds.</p>
<p>What does all of this show? It shows that the success of investing depends not only on the method, but also on your mindset, whether you can overcome your human weaknesses, and whether you can steadfastly execute your investment plan.</p>

<li><strong>The &ldquo;Financial Expert&rdquo; Scam:</strong> Many so-called &ldquo;financial experts&rdquo; are actually just salespeople for financial products. In order to earn commissions, they will recommend various complex financial products to you, such as insurance, bonds, annuities, etc. These products often come with high fees and less-than-ideal long-term returns. Annuity products in particular, are not only low-yielding and high-risk, but also severely impact your asset allocation and tax planning. Remember, truly good investments are often simple, and those complicated products are often traps.</li>
<li><strong>Noise from the Media and &ldquo;Experts&rdquo;:</strong> Many media outlets and so-called &ldquo;investment experts,&rdquo; in order to grab attention, publish all sorts of sensational market predictions. One minute they&rsquo;re saying a bull market is coming, the next a bear market is coming, and the next, that a certain industry is about to explode… This noise severely interferes with your judgment, making you unable to focus on long-term investment. Remember, what really matters is the long-term trend, not the short-term fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>The Temptation of Short-Term Trading:</strong> Many people dream of getting rich overnight, so they like to buy and sell frequently, trying to capture every market fluctuation. However, short-term trading not only requires you to have superb skills and keen market intuition, but also to bear enormous risks. For ordinary investors, short-term trading is often not worth the effort, and can even lead to serious losses. Frequent trading is like a gambler in a casino, often eventually losing it all.</li>
<li><strong>The Risks of High Leverage:</strong> Some investors, in order to pursue higher returns, use excessive leverage, such as margin accounts. However, leverage is a double-edged sword, it can amplify your returns, but also amplify your losses. If used improperly, it can easily lead to total ruin, and even bankruptcy. Remember, the first priority of investment is to control risk, not to pursue high returns. Never put your fate in the hands of luck, especially not with leveraged fate.</li>
<li><strong>The Risk of Not Learning:</strong> Many people know nothing about investment. They don&rsquo;t understand the essence of investment, nor their own risk tolerance, nor the characteristics of the products they are investing in. Such blind investment is like crossing the road with your eyes closed, full of risks.</li>

<p>&ldquo;Never sell,&rdquo; these four words, don&rsquo;t they sound a bit extreme? But they are the secret to enduring market cycles, the essence of long-term investing.</p>
<p>The essence of investing is to share in the growth dividends of excellent companies, not to gamble, in a casino, diving in and out. The logic behind &ldquo;never sell&rdquo; is actually very simple: as long as you are investing in excellent companies, and as long as you believe that these companies can continue to grow, then you should hold them for the long term, sharing in the dividends that their growth brings.</p>
<p>Frequent buying and selling will not only increase your transaction costs, but will also cause you to miss out on the compounding effect of long-term holding. More importantly, it will expose you to human weaknesses.</p>
<p>When the market is falling, you will feel panicked and will want to sell; when the market rises, you will become greedy and will want to chase after the price increases. As a result? You are often buying high and selling low, and are constantly harvested by the market.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;never sell&rdquo; strategy can help you overcome fear and greed, and allow you to always stay in the market, sharing in the dividends of economic growth.</p>

<p>Market downturns, for many people, are a nightmare, a disaster. But for true investors, they are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>
<p>Why is that? Because when the market is down, the stock prices of many high-quality companies will be severely undervalued, like a discounted sale, and buying at this time is like picking up a bargain.</p>
<p>Warren Buffett once famously said, &ldquo;Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.&rdquo; This quote is about this very principle.</p>
<p>Market downturns are temporary, while the market&rsquo;s long-term trend is upward. As long as you can overcome your fear and stick to your long-term investment strategy, you will be able to seize opportunities during market downturns, buy undervalued high-quality assets, and lay a solid foundation for future wealth growth.</p>

<p>The strategy of &ldquo;living off stock pledges&rdquo; can help you address your daily capital needs without selling your stock. This is a smarter way to manage finances.</p>
<p>Many people might ask, what is a stock pledge? Simply put, it is using your stock as collateral to borrow money from a financial institution. In this way, you can gain access to liquidity without selling your stock, and you can continue to enjoy the long-term appreciation of your stock.</p>
<p>Through stock pledges, you can avoid being forced to sell stocks with long-term growth potential due to temporary funding shortages. Furthermore, in many countries and regions, the capital gains tax rate is usually higher than the borrowing interest rate. Through stock pledges, you can also reasonably reduce your tax burden.</p>
<p>Of course, stock pledges also carry some risks. If the stock price drops sharply, you may need to provide additional collateral or face the risk of forced liquidation. Therefore, when using stock pledges, you must control your leverage ratio, and it is generally recommended that the pledge ratio not exceed 20% of your total assets.</p>

<p>In this age of information overload, we are bombarded daily with all sorts of information, especially in the field of investment. The opinions of various &ldquo;experts,&rdquo; various media reports, and various rumors, are difficult to distinguish between true and false, making people dizzy.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the ability to think independently, you can easily be swayed by this information and make wrong investment decisions.</p>
<p>Independent thinking is key to investment success. It means having your own judgment, not blindly following trends, not blindly believing in authority, and not being swayed by market sentiment.</p>
<p>The basis for independent thinking is learning and research. You need to continuously learn investment knowledge, study market laws, and understand the investment target. Only in this way can you form your own investment system and make correct decisions in the complex market environment.</p>
<p>Always remember that investment is your own business, and no one can make decisions for you.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Overthink Market Volatility:</strong> It is emphasized that ordinary investors do not need to over-focus on global affairs, short-term market fluctuations, company financial reports, etc., as these factors have limited impact on long-term investments. It points out that investors who frequently engage in short-term trading often &ldquo;pick up pennies and lose dollars,&rdquo; wasting both time and life.</li>
<li><strong>CLEC&rsquo;s Position:</strong> It is stated that CLEC (the club) is a non-profit investment and financial management channel that does not provide professional investment advisory services, nor does it receive any returns from members.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Warning:</strong> Investment involves risk; markets go up and down. Proceed with caution. Members need to conduct their own risk assessment and control and be responsible for their investment decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Asset Allocation:</strong> Over the past year, CLEC has continuously emphasized safe asset allocation, which is key to managing market risk and achieving steady long-term returns.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Video Resources:</strong> James has divided the four-hour-long video 00451 into short videos of about 15 minutes, making it easier for new members or those with limited time to learn. The short videos are subtitled in Chinese, English, and other languages to cater to members from different linguistic backgrounds.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended Learning Videos:</strong> It is recommended that everyone watch video 00451 for systematic learning. If you have time, you can watch videos 00398 and 00288. It is emphasized that investing is a field of study that requires continuous learning and practice.</li>
<li><strong>Necessity of Learning for New Members:</strong> For new members who have just joined CLEC, James recommends that they take the time to watch previous videos and systematically learn CLEC&rsquo;s investment philosophy and strategies to avoid repeatedly asking questions or making incorrect investment decisions due to misunderstandings.</li>
<li><strong>Answering Complex Questions:</strong> Some complex questions cannot be explained clearly through simple messages or emails. These questions often require a comprehensive analysis combining multiple videos and strategies, which members need to learn systematically to grasp.</li>
<li><strong>Refusal to Do Out-of-Scope Simulations:</strong> James clearly states that he will not consider scenarios beyond situation 1 to situation 9, nor will he do simulations outside of CLEC&rsquo;s investment framework for individual members.</li>
<li><strong>Global Investment Information:</strong> NASDAQ 100 index funds are available in many countries and regions around the world. James has compiled information from various locations into a document for members to easily access.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Context:</strong> It is emphasized that investments need to be viewed in the context of the current market, with a long-term perspective. It&rsquo;s important to believe that the market will eventually rise, investments require patience, and wealth accumulation takes time, using time to reap the great benefits of compound interest.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Zealand Tax System:</strong> The tax system in New Zealand is similar to that in Australia. Even if stocks are not sold, tax is required on unrealized capital gains.</li>
<li><strong>Overseas Investment Tax:</strong> In New Zealand, unrealized capital gains from investments in overseas markets (such as buying US stocks like QQQ or NDQ) are subject to tax, with a high tax rate of 33% - 39%.</li>
<li><strong>Tax Avoidance Strategies:</strong> The USG fund issued in New Zealand may serve as a temporary tax avoidance measure, as investment in this fund may not require the payment of unrealized capital gains tax.</li>
<li><strong>ASB Securities Pledge:</strong> In New Zealand, ASB Securities can provide stock-pledged loans. The loan ratios vary depending on the fund. For example, some funds can borrow 65%, 70%, or even 50%.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Long-Term Investment Wealth Expectations:</strong> James uses data to show that if you have 1 million USD now, long-term investment might turn it into 200 million USD; if you have 10 million NTD now, it could become 2 billion NTD in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Advocating Spiritual Consumption:</strong> James encourages everyone to engage in spiritual consumption, which are consumptions that leave no material trace and cause no environmental pollution. For example, the enjoyment of staying in a good hotel for a few thousand dollars may be better than buying a useless decorative item, as material possessions become old, break down, and are eventually discarded over time.</li>
<li><strong>Choice of Transportation:</strong> Whether to take a 40-minute bus ride or drive a 20-minute car depends on which method makes you feel more comfortable and less anxious. If it doesn’t cause anxiety, it’s a good choice.</li>
<li><strong>Reducing Material Desires:</strong> We should think about “what can we do without” rather than “what do we want.” Reduce our dependence on material goods, avoid buying unnecessary or excessive items, and focus on basic life necessities, such as healthy food.</li>
<li><strong>Rational Shopping:</strong> When shopping, rationally assess the practical use of the item and avoid blindly following trends in consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth Accumulation for Young People:</strong> Young people should try to reduce unnecessary spending and use the saved funds for investments to accumulate wealth more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Pursuit of Spiritual Eternity:</strong> Our goal is to pursue spiritual and investment eternity. Reduce material desires, simplify life, and use money for things that can bring long-lasting spiritual enjoyment.</li>

<li><strong>About Giving Birth and Adoption:</strong> James suggests young members should either have or adopt children because we have sufficient financial resources to raise them, form families, and that it’s a human right, so they shouldn’t give up on it.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Challenges for Retail Investors in Stock Picking:</strong> Retail investors picking individual stocks is like trying to find good fruit in a basket full of rotten fruit. The result is often that the more you pick, the more you mess things up.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Cutting Losses:</strong> James uses the analogy of a broken elevator to illustrate that if an investment is losing money, it’s better to cut the loss and get on a different elevator (investment) rather than to continue waiting or trying to fix the broken one. When investment goes wrong, one should cut losses decisively instead of holding or averaging down.</li>
<li><strong>Capital Safety:</strong> James advises investors not to send funds overseas, but to keep them locally or in Hong Kong for capital safety.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t Blindly Pick Stocks:</strong> When individual investors can&rsquo;t distinguish between good and bad stocks, they should avoid stock picking to prevent unnecessary losses.</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledging Limitations:</strong> Investors need to acknowledge their cognitive limitations and their ignorance; this is the essence of investment wisdom.</li>

<li><strong>Cautious Cross-Border Investment:</strong> James points out that if stock investments in Taiwan are not performing well, it&rsquo;s even more unwise to venture into overseas markets like the U.S., because competition in those markets is much more intense.</li>
<li><strong>Two Strategies to Address Losses:</strong> For investors who are losing money in Taiwan stock investments, James gives two pieces of advice: sell all individual stocks and buy 00662 ETF at market price, and hold for the long term; or sell all stocks and put funds in bank deposits, and exit the stock market entirely to avoid further losses.</li>
<li><strong>Contributions of Taiwanese Retail Investors:</strong> James points out that Taiwanese retail investors contribute over 150 billion NTD annually in transaction taxes to the government, so the government is motivated to encourage day trading and other short-term transactions.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Application of Beta Coefficient:</strong> In the US, adjusting the portfolio&rsquo;s beta coefficient to 1.2 is equivalent to using 20% leverage for investments.</li>
<li><strong>Order of Leverage Use:</strong> James suggests that investors first adjust the portfolio beta coefficient to 1.2, and then consider using credit, mortgages, and other forms of leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Borrowing Investment Strategy:</strong> After borrowing, it is still recommended to invest according to the 442/433 asset allocation ratio.</li>
<li><strong>Opposing Opportunism:</strong> James points out that some investors are always looking for various investment techniques or shortcuts instead of learning diligently, which is not recommended. He emphasizes that there are no shortcuts in investing; only through systematic learning and practice can one grasp the correct investment methods.</li>

If this money is invested and has an annualized return rate of 14%, it could grow to 1 billion USD after 40 years, and save the 40 years of potential mortgage repayments and property maintenance fees.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Cost of Renting:</strong> If you pay 15,000 USD in rent per month, the total amount repaid in 40 years will be as high as 22 million USD.</li>
<li><strong>Depreciation Risks of Property:</strong> A house built 60 years ago may no longer be habitable. Similarly, a house purchased now may face the same problem in 60 years. In contrast, renting allows the flexibility to choose appropriate housing based on changing needs.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing 1: <strong>Convenience of Having Funds.</strong> Brian shared his experience of seeing a dentist in Taiwan. Since he had ample funds, he could pay in cash, unlike some people with limited finances who might experience delays due to cash flow issues. He felt the convenience of having funds.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Agreed with Brian&rsquo;s point, stating that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really good to have money&rdquo; as it can solve many problems and can even &ldquo;buy&rdquo; better relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 2: <strong>Taiwan Living Experience.</strong> Brian chose to stay at a hotel instead of with his parents when returning to Taiwan. He felt that staying at a hotel offered more freedom and fewer constraints. Furthermore, when eating out, he could pay for himself instead of his parents or in-laws, which gave him a sense of financial independence and control.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Suggests that family gatherings in Taiwan can be held in hotels, and if family members are willing, they can also stay at the hotel together, using money to obtain a more comfortable living environment and a higher quality of life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 3: <strong>Fund Allocation and Investment Strategies.</strong> Brian re-adjusted his fund allocation based on James’s investment philosophy. He found that even in the worst market conditions (e.g., a 20% market drop), his funds were still safe. He used funds from broker loans and investment returns and calculated that even after retirement, if he continues to invest a fixed amount each year, his “visualization rate” would not be lower than 200%. He believes the Excel spreadsheets provided by James are very helpful for understanding how funds grow and managing asset allocation.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Affirming Brian&rsquo;s approach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 4: <strong>Building Confidence in Borrowing for Investment.</strong> Brian believes that if he never uses borrowing, he might feel psychological resistance when he actually needs to use it. Therefore, he started to try using broker loans and considered reinvesting the borrowed funds. He believes that practical operation can help better understand how to use borrowing and find the most suitable way.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Shared his own experience, that he uses borrowed money as much as possible, rather than spending his own money, when travelling or eating out. He emphasizes that his assets will never be spent, and any income will immediately be used to buy QQQ. He further explains that buying 00662 actually helps the Taiwan Central Bank activate its foreign exchange reserves, reduce inflationary pressure, and also activate idle capital in Taiwan. However, safe asset allocation is a prerequisite for borrowing to invest. Without understanding safe asset allocation, one cannot use this tool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding his fund allocation, should he put QQQ and QLD into a Roth IRA, and then use the borrowed funds for other investments, such as buying TQQQ, and whether his current fund allocation is reasonable and carries any risks?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regarding Asset Allocation:</strong> Brian&rsquo;s current approach is to invest some funds in QQQ, some in QLD (2x leveraged QQQ), and keep some in cash. James points out that when Brian&rsquo;s retirement account doesn&rsquo;t have much money, it is not very efficient or risk-free to pledge and put the money in the broker investment account, and to use leveraged funds (such as QLD).</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Black Swan Events:</strong> James emphasizes that Brian needs to have sufficient cash, exceeding the amount of his brokerage loans. This is to prevent &ldquo;black swan events,&rdquo; i.e., unpredictable major risk events.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended Asset Allocation:</strong> James suggests Brian puts QQQ and QLD into his Roth IRA account, and either keeps the traditional IRA account as cash or keeps enough cash in his brokerage account, ensuring that the cash amount exceeds the borrowed amount.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding 442/433 Allocation:</strong> James further explains that 442 and 433 are just references, and the specific asset allocation ratio needs to be adjusted according to individual situations. He emphasizes several key principles: have enough cash, and have more cash than borrowed money; the ratio of leveraged funds should not exceed the ratio of the original funds (such as QQQ). For young people, they can do a 442 allocation at the highest, meaning the ratio of leveraged funds and original funds are the same.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Allocation Adjustments:</strong> James points out that after allocating assets according to the 442 ratio, the ratio of leveraged funds will automatically increase as the market rises, which is normal. Because assets are increasing, and cash is also increasing, the overall safety is actually much higher than the beginning.</li>

<li>
<p>Sharing 1: <strong>Book Recommendations.</strong> Peter recommended two investment and financial management books: &ldquo;The Long Game&rdquo; by Nick Maggiulli and &ldquo;Atomic Habits&rdquo; by James Clear. He believes that many of the ideas in these books are very similar to James&rsquo;s investment philosophy.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Stated that the content of the books was similar to the investment concepts they discussed, and if anyone has time, they should read them as there is a lot of data that can verify our previous viewpoints.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 2: <strong>Building a Habit of Borrowing for Investment.</strong> Peter shared his experience with borrowing for investment, believing that it&rsquo;s a habit that needs to be cultivated. Only by being accustomed to this operation will one not feel unfamiliar or resistant to borrowing when assets reach a certain scale (e.g., 1 million, 2 million). Peter also mentioned that in the investment process, you need to construct two curves in your mind: one is the total assets curve rising, and the other is the total liabilities curve also rising, but the slope of the total liabilities curve should be less than that of the total assets curve. This way, assets will increase over time, while the proportion of liabilities will decrease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 3: <strong>Negotiating Lower Loan Interest Rates with Banks.</strong> Peter shared his experience negotiating lower loan interest rates with the bank. He mentioned that loan interest rates can be negotiated with the bank. He personally called the bank and successfully lowered his loan interest rate by 0.7%. He encourages everyone to not be afraid to try, to take the initiative to communicate with the bank, and to fight for lower loan interest rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 4: <strong>Understanding &ldquo;Owning Equity Means Owning the World.&rdquo;</strong> Peter expressed that he was impressed with James&rsquo;s idea that &ldquo;when you own equity assets in Wall Street stocks, you own the world,&rdquo; and the idea of &ldquo;never sell assets.&rdquo; He now understands the importance of owning equity assets and the meaning of long-term holdings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 5: <strong>Importance of Spiritual Consumption.</strong> Peter highly agreed with the concept of &ldquo;spiritual consumption&rdquo; put forth by James. He believes that traveling, good food, having more children, and being present in their growth, are all good forms of spiritual consumption.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding funds management in Roth IRA and investment accounts. Terry mentioned that he has 401k, Roth IRA, and brokerage accounts in the US. He wants to know if he can use leverage in a Roth IRA account, and whether he must borrow via his brokerage investment account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restrictions on Retirement Accounts:</strong> James clearly stated that retirement accounts (such as 401k, Roth IRA) cannot be used as collateral, meaning one cannot use assets in retirement accounts to borrow. Only assets in a broker&rsquo;s investment account can be pledged for loans.</li>
<li><strong>Role of IRA Assets:</strong> James explained that while IRA assets cannot be used directly to pledge for borrowing, the amount of assets affects the interest rates of the loan. When brokers evaluate the borrower&rsquo;s overall financial situation, they consider the assets in the IRA account, which might lead to more favorable interest rates. However, the amount of assets in an IRA account does not determine how much can be borrowed.</li>
<li><strong>Calculating Loan Amounts and Interest Rates:</strong> James explained how loan amounts and interest rates are calculated. The amount that can be borrowed is usually 60% to 70% of the assets in the investment account. The interest rate on the loan is determined by a combination of factors, including the base lending rate, the size of assets in the investment account, and the size of assets in retirement accounts such as IRA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Can one increase income by selling Covered Calls for QQQ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opposing Covered Call Strategy:</strong> James explicitly opposed the Covered Call strategy that Terry suggested. He believes the strategy is not necessary and carries high risks.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Covered Call:</strong> James explained that if a Covered Call strategy is used and the market suddenly rises significantly, the options would most likely be exercised, forcing the investor to sell QQQ at the agreed price (usually below market price), thus missing out on the profits from the rise. Alternatively, the investor would need to pay more funds to repurchase QQQ.</li>

<li>
<p>Sharing: <strong>Recognition of CLEC and James&rsquo;s Investment Philosophy.</strong> Jason first expressed his gratitude to CLEC and James, believing that they bring surprises each year. From the initial advice of &ldquo;sell individual stocks, sell actively managed funds, and go all-in on QQQ&rdquo; to last year&rsquo;s &ldquo;asset allocation,&rdquo; this year&rsquo;s &ldquo;continuous optimization of asset allocation,&rdquo; and now the &ldquo;442&rdquo; and &ldquo;433&rdquo; allocation, James&rsquo;s investment philosophy and strategies are constantly evolving and improving. This has helped investors avoid external interference and truly achieve &ldquo;not being overjoyed by external gains, and not being saddened by external losses.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: When doing a &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; of asset allocation, if the predetermined ratios are not met, for example, if the ratio of leveraged funds has not yet reached the requirement of a &ldquo;433&rdquo; allocation, is it still necessary to perform &ldquo;smart rebalancing?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trigger Conditions for Rebalancing:</strong> James explained that if the ratio of leveraged funds has not reached the predetermined target, for example, the 442 ratio, there is no need to do &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; for the time being. You can wait until the ratio reaches or exceeds the predetermined target before adjusting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Regarding how to solve children&rsquo;s university tuition fees. Jason mentioned that university fees in the US are very high, especially for out-of-state students, where tuition and living expenses could reach 100,000 USD annually. Some of his friends are considering &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; some funds, such as by purchasing annuities, insurance, or transferring funds to others&rsquo; names to apply for student aid to alleviate financial burdens. He would like to know what advice James has on this matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opposing the Practice of &ldquo;Hiding Money&rdquo;:</strong> James strongly opposed the practice of &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; funds to save on university fees. He believes this practice is counterproductive and may even be illegal.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages of Annuities and Insurance:</strong> James pointed out that investing funds in annuities or insurance may reduce the amount of assets needed for disclosure in the short term, potentially qualifying for more student aid. However, it results in a huge loss of investment returns in the long term. He uses an example of 500,000 USD; if that amount was used for investments with an annual return of 14%, it could grow to 1.3 billion USD in 60 years. Whereas if that money is invested in annuities or insurance, the rate of return would be much lower, and the liquidity of the funds would be restricted.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Risks of &ldquo;Hiding Money&rdquo;:</strong> James specifically emphasized that transferring funds to others&rsquo; names, for example, to parents in China, and then having parents send funds back to the US annually, is suspected of money laundering and fraud, which is a serious criminal act in the United States. If discovered, there are severe consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Suggested Practice:</strong> James suggested that instead of &ldquo;hiding money,&rdquo; the money should be used for investments to grow the wealth. Even if one does not help their children pay for university fees, children can apply for student loans themselves. When they graduate and the assets have grown in value, one can use that to help repay the loans.</li>
<li><strong>Other Options:</strong> James also mentioned that children can earn some of their living expenses by working part-time or at a side job, such as driving a rideshare or doing other small part-time jobs, where they can earn tens of thousands of USD each year.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing 1: <strong>Personal Investment Experience and Confidence.</strong> Opa shared his experience of going all-in on QQQ. He bought it at the peak of the market, and although it declined for some time, his investment recovered to the previous high by the first half of this year and is now highly profitable. This experience has given him great confidence in long-term investments and a deeper understanding of bear markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 2: <strong>Daughter&rsquo;s Investment Experience and Transformation.</strong> Opa mentioned that his daughter previously had more faith in her financial advisor, and had given the advisor more than 1 million USD to manage. However, the advisor&rsquo;s investment strategy was too diversified, allocating assets across 20-30 ETFs, covering various indexes and small-cap stocks, which resulted in poor overall returns. Opa had been trying to persuade his daughter to change her investment strategy, but she would not listen. It was not until recently, after having two children, that she began to reconsider due to increased financial pressure. At a Christmas family gathering, Opa once again explained the power of compounding and the impact of the technology sector on productivity to his daughter. His daughter finally understood the importance of long-term and focused investments and plans to transfer about 2 million USD to a broker account that allows stock pledges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding the loan interest rate on 2 million USD in a broker account. Opa mentioned that according to the broker’s website, the loan interest rates for 2 million USD is still very high. He would like to know how to get a lower interest rate, and whether the loan interest rate is calculated based on total assets or the actual amount of the loan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Negotiating Lower Interest Rates:</strong> James first pointed out that loan interest rates can be negotiated with the broker. He suggests that Opa&rsquo;s daughter directly contact the broker and ask for a lower rate.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rate Calculation Methods:</strong> James explained that brokers take a number of factors into consideration when assessing the loan interest rate, including the borrower&rsquo;s total assets, loan amount, and duration of the loan. Generally, the larger the total asset, the smaller the loan amount as a percentage of the total asset, and the longer the loan duration, the lower the interest rate.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rate for 2 Million:</strong> James estimated the loan interest rate that Opa&rsquo;s daughter could receive based on her situation. He mentioned that the base rate announced on the broker&rsquo;s website was just a benchmark, and the actual rate would require further negotiations. He recommends that Opa&rsquo;s daughter directly contact the broker&rsquo;s staff member, Lisa, for a more detailed consultation. He also provided a calculation formula: 2.9% - 0.5% = 2.4%. 2.9% is the base interest rate for a 2 million loan in the brokerage, and 0.5% is the discount that Opa&rsquo;s daughter could get based on the size of her assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Regarding how to perform asset allocation. Opa’s current asset allocation is 811, which means 80% QQQ, 10% QLD, and 10% Cash. His goal is to adjust the asset allocation to 442, which means 40% QQQ, 40% QLD, and 20% Cash. He wants to know if it’s better to put leveraged assets (such as QLD) in the Roth IRA account, and the normal account in cash plus QQQ, to better maintain the correct ratio of the standard account during a bear market. Also, if there is a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; asset allocation plan, should all the funds in the Roth IRA be allocated to QLD, and the normal account to cash plus QQQ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interpretation of 811 Allocation:</strong> James first interpreted the meaning of the 811 allocation and said that there is nothing wrong with the allocation approach.</li>
<li><strong>View on &ldquo;Perfect&rdquo; Allocation:</strong> James believes that if one only has a Roth IRA account and a normal account, then it is acceptable to allocate all of the Roth IRA funds to QLD and allocate the normal account to cash plus QQQ.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility of Asset Allocation:</strong> James emphasizes that the specific asset allocation ratio should be adjusted based on individual situations. For example, it depends on the percentage of total assets that the Roth IRA account represents. If the Roth IRA account represents 40% of the total asset, then all the funds in the Roth IRA account can be allocated to QLD to reach the 442 allocation target. However, if the Roth IRA funds only account for a smaller percentage, say 20% or 30%, then the 442 target allocation cannot be reached, and the allocation will most likely be 622.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage Choices:</strong> James also mentioned that if one hopes to increase the percentage of the Roth IRA account to 40%, one can consider using 3x leveraged ETFs such as TQQQ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: Regarding the use of funds in his 401k account. Opa mentioned that he and his wife&rsquo;s 401k accounts are still in their respective company plans and cannot be rolled over until they reach the age of 65 (still two years away). He would like to know how to manage these funds now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Allocating Cash to the 401k Account:</strong> James recommended that Opa allocate cash to his 401k account, because the 401k account usually has some tax-saving policies. Keeping cash in the 401k account can take full advantage of these policies.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding QQQ’s Long-Term Investment Returns:</strong> James shared some data regarding QQQ’s long-term investment returns. He pointed out that QQQ’s annualized return over the last 5 years is approximately 19%, the annualized return over the last 10 years is approximately 17%, and the annualized return over the last 20 years is approximately 14%. He also points out that QQQ is accelerating human growth, and its future return might be higher and higher, therefore investments must be made.</li>

<li>
<p>Sharing 1: <strong>Observations and Reflections on Social Phenomena.</strong> Young shared an observation she made at work and in her life: many people work very hard in their respective fields and put in a lot of time and energy, whether it&rsquo;s running a business, working at a job. However, they do not give much importance to how they manage their money, or they don&rsquo;t know how to make effective investments. Young believes this might be because they do not understand investments, or they do not realize the importance of investments. She emphasizes that as long as one has the correct investment methods, they can achieve greater freedom in their work and life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 2: <strong>Risks of Insurance Products.</strong> Young has worked in the insurance industry for many years. She has come in contact with many clients and has seen many unreasonable insurance products. She gave a specific example: a client paid 500,000 RMB in insurance premiums every year for three years, totaling 1.5 million RMB. It has been 8 years now, and some years ago, this client borrowed over 800,000 RMB due to a cash shortage. If the client now wants to withdraw the policy, after deducting the borrowed amount, he can only get back 300,000 RMB. That is to say, he would still lose money. In addition, the client has never paid any interest on the loan. Young points out that the interest rate on policy loans in China is often 5%, while the return on the policy is only 3%. This means the interest paid annually by clients is far higher than the returns provided by the insurance company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 3: <strong>Agreement with James&rsquo;s Investment Philosophy.</strong> Young stated that she agrees with James&rsquo;s investment philosophy, especially the point that &ldquo;you shouldn’t try to make money that isn’t necessary.&rdquo; She believes that we should focus our primary time and energy on our work and lives, instead of spending a lot of time researching investment products such as stocks and funds. All one needs to do is to hold long-term investments in the stocks of the world&rsquo;s best 100 companies, and then spend more time enhancing our spiritual energy, being with our families, and enjoying life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question: Regarding the risks for clients opening an account in Hong Kong to purchase US Treasury bonds. Young mentioned that the interest rates on Chinese government bonds are very low, at about 1.6%, while the interest rates on US Treasury bonds are as high as 4.6%. Some people she knows are recommending that Chinese clients open bank accounts in Hong Kong, then exchange RMB into USD to purchase 5 or 10 year US Treasury bonds. She would like to know what risks are involved in such operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Need to Understand Specific Operational Details:</strong> James first pointed out that he would need to understand more specific operation details before he can assess the risks involved. He specifically mentioned that the normal procedure for treasury bonds does not require going through an insurance company, and he was unclear about the specific procedure and organizations involved in purchasing US treasury bonds, therefore he cannot provide concrete suggestions.</li>
<li><strong>Doubts Regarding &ldquo;High Returns&rdquo;:</strong> James expressed doubts about this kind of &ldquo;high return&rdquo; investment method. He believes that if there really was such a good investment opportunity, the insurance company&rsquo;s own funds would be invested, instead of recommending it to clients. He reminds everyone not to easily trust the so-called high-return and low-risk investment products, because there are often unknown risks behind them.</li>

<p>Question 1: Regarding asset allocation after retirement and calculating amounts for pledging and borrowing. Wave mentioned that she is planning to retire this year, and she would like to know whether she can pledge her stocks to borrow funds after retirement, and how to calculate the amount that can be borrowed. She also mentioned that her 30 year-old son would like to understand the issues of pledging and loans, and how to explain the methods of calculation to him, and where to find relevant information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation after Retirement:</strong> James first introduced two different methods of asset allocation after retirement:
<ul>
<li><strong>Not Pledging and Borrowing:</strong> If you are not planning to pledge and borrow funds, you can allocate 80% of your assets to QQQ and 20% to cash. Each year, you can use the cash part to pay living expenses, and rebalance at the end of the year, re-adjusting the ratio back to 80% and 20%.</li>
<li><strong>Pledging and Borrowing:</strong> If you plan to pledge and borrow funds, then you should adopt the 433 method of asset allocation, which means 40% QQQ, 30% QLD (2x leverage QQQ), 30% cash (or money market fund). Each year, you can borrow 2% of your total asset for living expenses, and also rebalance at the end of the year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Calculating Loan Amounts:</strong> James explained that the amount that can be borrowed depends on total assets and the type of asset. Generally, about 60%-70% of the total assets can be borrowed. However, different types of assets will have different ratios. For example, the amount that can be borrowed from QQQ is about 70%, while the amount that can be borrowed from cash and money market funds such as SWVXX can be as high as 96%.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding the Choice Between 442 and 433:</strong> James points out that for young people, 442 and 433 are both acceptable asset allocation options. The 442 allocation can achieve higher expected returns, but the risk is also comparatively higher; the 433 allocation is more stable. He suggests that Wave&rsquo;s son choose the allocation method most suitable for his personal risk tolerance and investment goals. If one plans to do pledging from the very start, 433 allocation can be considered, because the taxes paid will be less when making changes to the assets.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Learning Resources:</strong> James told Wave that he had organized and provided all of the articles and video links that covered the topics of asset allocation and pledging stock for loans, and she can find details on calculation methods and operation guides from these resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Regarding the view that “the estate will only be 1 million.” Wave mentioned that she recently saw a video by James that mentioned “the estate will only be 1 million in the future,” which moved her greatly. She believes that if one can increase one&rsquo;s wealth via borrowing for investment, and use that wealth for helping others during one&rsquo;s lifetime, that would be very meaningful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explaining &ldquo;Estate Will Only Be 1 Million&rdquo;:</strong> James explained that it does not actually mean that only 1 million will be left to the children as an estate, but that one should use investment loans to make the most of one&rsquo;s assets, so that one can do more meaningful things with the funds, instead of leaving all of the wealth to the children. He used an example of 300 million in assets. If 290 million are borrowed out, only 1 million will be left, but the 300 million in assets, and the 290 million in liabilities, can still be transferred to the children, and they can use that borrowed money and the rest of the assets.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Estate Planning:</strong> James also mentioned that in order to avoid high estate taxes, one can consider establishing a trust, and transferring assets into that trust, similar to how Buffet and Bill Gates do it.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding the calculation and negotiation of interest rates on stock-pledged loans, and the impact of retirement account assets on borrowing rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Calculation:</strong> James explained that interest on stock-pledged loans consists of two parts: a fixed spread (also called fixed interest rate spread, which depends on the broker and borrower’s creditworthiness) and a floating rate (usually referencing SOFR, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate). For a loan of 1 million, if the fixed spread is 4%, the total borrowing rate may reach about 8% when combined with the floating rate.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rate Negotiation:</strong> James emphasized that loan interest rates are negotiable with the broker. He advises Julia to proactively communicate with the broker to negotiate a lower rate.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Retirement Account Assets:</strong> James pointed out that while assets in retirement accounts (such as IRA, 401k) cannot be directly pledged for loans, the amount of these assets impacts the borrowing rate. When assessing the borrower’s overall repayment ability and risk status, brokers will consider the assets in retirement accounts. If the assets in retirement accounts are substantial, the borrower might qualify for more favorable interest rates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: After opening an account, can one apply for a stock-pledged loan immediately? Will the borrowing limit be adjusted annually?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apply Immediately:</strong> James confirmed that one can apply for a stock-pledged loan immediately after opening an account.</li>
<li><strong>Limit Adjustments:</strong> James explained that the borrowing limit is calculated based on the asset value of the account, which will fluctuate with market conditions. Therefore, the borrowing limit is not fixed but is dynamically adjusted according to the market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: If there are investment losses, will the borrowing limit decrease?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yes:</strong> James clearly pointed out that if there are investment losses, leading to a decline in the account asset value, the borrowing limit will decrease accordingly. He gave an example: If there were originally 1 million in assets, the borrowing limit may be 700,000. If there was a loss of 300,000, leaving 700,000, the borrowing limit would become 490,000 (70% of 700,000). Brokers will re-calculate the borrowing limit based on the updated net asset value.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Adjustment of Borrowing Limits:</strong> James emphasized that brokers dynamically adjust the borrowing limit based on the real-time value of the assets in the account. This means if there are investment losses, the borrowing limit decreases. If there are investment profits, the borrowing limit increases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 4: What is the difference between stock-pledged loans and margin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Costs:</strong> James pointed out that the interest on margin loans is usually higher than that on stock-pledged loans.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Forced Liquidation:</strong> James explained that both margin and stock-pledged loans carry the risk of forced liquidation. However, margin has a stricter forced liquidation mechanism. When the net asset value of the account falls below a certain maintenance margin ratio, the broker will immediately force liquidation to recover the loan. Stock-pledged loans have a relatively more lenient forced liquidation mechanism. Brokers may give the borrower some buffer time or communicate with the borrower before forcing liquidation. Overall, the forced liquidation risk of margin loans is higher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 5: After borrowing funds, can they be used for investment?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No:</strong> James stated clearly that using borrowed money to reinvest in the stock market is illegal. He emphasized that brokers usually specify in the loan agreements that the loan cannot be used to purchase stocks or other investment products.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Violations:</strong> James explained that brokers can monitor the flow of funds, and although it may not immediately trigger forced liquidation, if such activities are discovered, it may lead to the account being frozen and loans being recalled with severe consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> James advises members to strictly comply with the broker’s regulations and use the borrowed funds for consumption or other non-investment purposes.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding the calculation of borrowing limits under a 433 asset allocation. Shawn mentioned that he is currently using a 433 asset allocation, which means 40% QQQ, 30% QLD (2x leveraged QQQ), and 30% cash. He would like to know if, when calculating his borrowing limits, the broker also includes the QLD component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>QLD is Not Included:</strong> James clearly stated that in a 433 allocation, the broker does not include QLD when calculating the borrowing limit. This means only the QQQ and cash parts are used to calculate the borrowing limit.</li>
<li><strong>Specific Calculation:</strong> James provided an example: If Shawn has 1 million in total assets, and the 433 allocation is 400,000 in QQQ, 300,000 in QLD, and 300,000 in cash, the amount that can be borrowed is 70% of the 400,000 in QQQ, which is 280,000, plus 96% of the 300,000 in cash (assuming the borrowing ratio for cash or money market funds such as SWVXX is 96%), which is 288,000. Combined, the total amount that can be borrowed is 568,000.</li>
<li><strong>Significance of the 433 Allocation:</strong> James explained that the significance of the 433 allocation lies in its balance of returns and risks. By allocating a certain percentage of leveraged funds (such as QLD), the expected return of the overall investment portfolio can be increased. At the same time, allocating a certain percentage of cash can reduce the risk of the investment portfolio and provide a buffer during market declines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: If the 433 allocation method is used and the total asset is 1 million, then borrowing 2% annually (20,000) may not be enough for retirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 Million in Assets Not Enough for Retirement:</strong> James agreed with Shawn’s point. He pointed out that if the total assets is only 1 million, even if 2% is borrowed annually, that would only be 20,000, which would not be enough for retirement.</li>
<li><strong>433 Allocation is for Total Assets:</strong> James emphasized that the 433 allocation is with regard to the total assets, not a single account. He advises Shawn to include all assets, including retirement accounts (such as IRA, 401k) and non-retirement accounts, in the 433 asset allocation framework.</li>
<li><strong>Allocation Across Different Accounts:</strong> James advises that QQQ and QLD should be allocated primarily to retirement accounts, because retirement accounts usually have tax benefits, allowing for tax deferral, thus enhancing the effect of compounding returns. The cash portion should primarily be allocated to non-retirement accounts to allow for ease of access when needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: Concerned about the possibility of hacking or accidental errors leading to the sale of QQQ; is there a way to restrict the selling of QQQ in the account?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Security Concerns:</strong> James stated he understands Shawn&rsquo;s concern because long-term holdings of QQQ, once sold, would lead to large tax burdens.</li>
<li><strong>Possibility of Restricting Selling:</strong> James said that he is not certain whether there is a function that directly restricts the selling of a specific stock in the account, as he does not work at a brokerage and is unclear about the specific operation permissions and function settings. However, he advises Shawn to contact the broker directly (for example, Lisa, whom he recommended) and inquire if they have the relevant settings or services.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthening Account Security:</strong> James emphasized that protecting the account is very important. He advised Shawn to take actions to strengthen the security level of the account, such as using a strong password, enabling two-factor authentication, and using a hardware security key.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Investing requires learning, new members need to watch previous videos to learn systematically.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The background of this idea is the influx of new members, who are asking many questions that have already been answered in previous videos. Therefore new members need systematic learning.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Acknowledging one’s own ignorance is power, and ignorance is wisdom.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The reason why many retail investors lose money is that they are overconfident, trade frequently, chase highs and sell lows, and cannot understand the essence of the market. Acknowledging one&rsquo;s cognitive limitations is necessary to avoid making rash decisions, and to make more rational investment decisions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s great to have money, you can use it to resolve worries, and to buy relationships.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is based on Brian’s sharing of his experiences after gaining financial independence, and his ability to spend his own money, and treat his family, which gave him more freedom and control. It shows the conveniences that money provides.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Humanity is growing at an accelerating pace, and investment returns will get higher and higher.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This conclusion is based on data on QQQ&rsquo;s past 20 years of investment returns, and emphasizes the effects of compound interest due to technological developments. Long-term investment in high-quality assets that are representative of the direction of technological development allows one to share the bonuses of human progress.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Encourage borrowing for investment, leave only 1 million in the estate, show respect.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is based on long-term investments, compounding returns, and sensible asset allocation, allowing one to maximize wealth, and to use loans to enhance one&rsquo;s quality of life, or to help others. With sensible asset allocation, loans for investment can accelerate the growth of wealth, and not simply accumulating wealth to leave to the next generation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There are no shortcuts in investing, only through systematic learning and practice can one master correct investment methods.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is a message to those who are trying to find investment skills and shortcuts, but are unwilling to learn systematically. Investing is a complex field of study that requires continuous learning and practice in order to improve one&rsquo;s investment expertise.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>When you own equity assets in Wall Street stocks, you own the world.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is an emphasis on the importance of long-term holdings of high-quality equity assets. Stocks are not merely an investment tool, but also represent ownership of a company. By holding the stocks of the world’s best companies, one can share in the wealth generated by these companies worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t try to make money that isn’t necessary.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is to advise investors not to over-pursue short-term gains while overlooking the value of long-term investing. We should focus our main time and energy on our work and lives, instead of spending too much time researching short-term market fluctuations or attempting to earn the difference by trading frequently.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The numbers 442 and 433 are merely references, and the specific asset allocation ratio must be adjusted according to individual situations.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is to emphasize the flexibility and personalization of asset allocation. Each person has a different risk tolerance, investment goals, capital size, etc., and therefore, they need to devise the appropriate asset allocation plan based on their actual situation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Protecting account security is very important.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This reminds investors to take account security seriously, and to take the necessary actions to prevent the account from being stolen or accidentally mishandled. Because if this occurs, it will lead to severe losses, and especially for long-term held assets, the losses would be even greater.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: The chaos in the domestic insurance industry, where banks lure customers into buying insurance with high commissions, is even linked to the performance evaluations of customer managers. Many customers do not understand investments and choose low-yield or even risky insurance products to preserve their capital. He also shared a case of a friend who was defrauded of over 1.7 million in a romance scam, illustrating the complexity of the domestic financial environment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment</strong>: The US financial system strictly separates life insurance from other financial businesses, and there is no such thing as banks selling insurance. The financial supervision in China and Taiwan is problematic. Banks should focus on deposit and loan business and should not be involved in insurance and investment. This chaos will ultimately harm the interests of emerging countries.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: Took over the family food business ten years ago when the company&rsquo;s assets and liabilities were zero. After ten years of operation, the company turned a profit, and its current value (including real estate) is about 300 million NTD. Over the past decade, he distributed about 200 million NTD of revenue to his family, retaining 100 million NTD for loan purposes. Currently, he has invested 80 million in 00662 (a 2x leveraged Nasdaq 100 index ETF) and 20 million in 00631L (Taiwan&rsquo;s 50 Positive 2 ETF).
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment</strong>: None</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: The bank will allocate a loan of 60 million NTD on January 1st. Should this fund be used to buy 00662 all at once, or should he wait for a 20% market drop before buying? Also, if the market crashes and 00662 and 00631L go to zero, how will he deal with it?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: If the market goes to zero, the company can still make loan payments. The worst-case scenario is that the land is auctioned off, and he can still get tens of millions. Since the worst has been considered, how to buy the 60 million is not important. If it were me, I would buy it all on Monday. If you choose to wait for a 20% drop before buying, you can follow your plan and inform everyone when you buy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: How to maintain good health?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: Regular comprehensive physical examinations are necessary. I have been doing annual check-ups since my thirties. Wellness, like asset allocation, needs to be personalized. The advice I can give everyone now is to eat well, sleep well, and don&rsquo;t worry. What to eat specifically, what exercises to do, etc., need to be decided according to personal circumstances and cannot be given a unified recommendation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: What are your views on Taiwan&rsquo;s politics and how to support political parties?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: Regarding politics and religious beliefs, everyone has different positions and viewpoints. Discussing these issues in the classroom is meaningless and fruitless. It is recommended that students do not discuss these topics in the classroom and keep their opinions to themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 4</strong>: How to preserve assets in response to potential cross-strait issues? He currently has about 200 million NTD in assets in Taiwan and a house worth 8 million in Vietnam. How should he allocate his assets?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: If you can&rsquo;t sleep due to worries about cross-strait issues, it&rsquo;s recommended to immigrate as soon as possible. If you choose to stay in Taiwan, you need to make some decisions, such as whether to close the company. If the 40 employees are causing you distress, consider closing the company and compensating them. Life decisions should be decisive, not prolonged. Be responsible for your own happiness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Additional question</strong>: How to get rid of the shackles of the family business?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: You have managed the company very well. The choice is your life. Do whatever makes you happy. If the family business makes you unhappy, shut it down and give the employees a good severance package. Consider your own life, not your father&rsquo;s. If your father&rsquo;s business is no longer your concern, and it&rsquo;s not bringing you happiness, then let it go.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: Based in Canada, unable to leverage stocks. If income decreases in a certain year, and the tax rate drops from 32% to 24%, is it worth selling some stocks to increase income to the 32% tax bracket to improve the future cost basis?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: It is not recommended to sell stocks because selling incurs taxes. Canada&rsquo;s tax system is very unfavorable for stock investments. When immigrating, consider future generations and choose countries with development prospects. In Canada, you can consider using an IB account for loans, but this will face inheritance tax issues, possibly up to 40%. Therefore, when planning estates, minimize assets in IB accounts. In the long run, trusts can be used to avoid taxes. It is currently not recommended to sell stocks for short-term tax benefits. Consider selling after retirement when income is lower.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Additional explanation</strong>: IB accounts have a low financing ratio for Canadian stocks, only up to 50%.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s addition</strong>: You can borrow 40% first, and add more if needed. But ultimately, there will still be inheritance tax issues.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Through learning, I realized that my investment was too risky, and emergency funds should not all be invested in QQQ. Now I have withdrawn 36 months of emergency funds back to the Money Market Fund. When starting with small funds, one should focus on their main job and increase income sources. After investing in index funds, my mindset changed, and I began to focus on the importance of timing. Therefore, I started to focus on diet, fitness, and learning from the experiences of long-lived people around me. In addition, I learned from investing to avoid risks, such as giving up dangerous activities like diving.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment</strong>: It is wise to learn from the experiences of others. Being overly aggressive is human nature, but it is important to realize and correct it in time. It is wrong to increase positions when the market is rising and to be fearful when it is falling. It should be the other way around. Emergency funds should not be added to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How to judge whether you are being too adventurous? For example, increasing the leverage ratio of asset allocation from 1.0 to 1.8 when stocks are rising.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: This is also a necessary evil. Now that you realize it&rsquo;s not right, you can start to retreat, or when it rises, you buy in, and when it falls, you get scared. Oh, what to do? Then start to retreat. Once you have learned, don&rsquo;t do it again. So, as Buffett said, when others are greedy, you should be fearful, and when others are fearful, you should be greedy. That&rsquo;s the right pace. So, when you want to increase your position in the future, it should be when others are fearful. That&rsquo;s how I do it. This emergency fund should not be increased. Regardless of whether the market is rising or falling, you should not add to this cervical spine disease. How could you add to it? This is not allowed. Then, if you use our asset allocation, when the market falls, you automatically buy in for one year, and when the market rises, you automatically withdraw from the leveraged fund. This is passive, and this has already achieved the practice of being greedy when others are fearful and being fearful when others are greedy.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: The relationship between the asset-backed ratio and cash reserves. If asset-backed financing is carried out, how to ensure that the cash on hand is greater than the pledged amount? For example, with assets of 1 million, allocated according to the 721 ratio, 200,000 is pledged, but 100,000 in cash cannot be moved. Is it necessary to balance for one or two years to accumulate 200,000 in cash before making a pledge?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: You cannot borrow 200,000 all at once; you can only borrow 2% per year. When conducting asset-backed financing, the asset allocation should be 433, not 721. Borrow 2% each year and conduct &ldquo;smart rebalancing.&rdquo; Even if the market falls, you will not be forced to liquidate. The cash ratio may be lower than the loan ratio in extreme cases (such as a continuous 10-year decline), but since the total asset value is still greater than the debt, there will be no problem.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Regarding the Debt to Equity Ratio of companies. It is found that there are large differences in the debt-to-equity ratios of Buffett and many technology companies. Is this related to the nature of the industry? For example, the debt-to-equity ratio of software companies is usually low, while that of hardware companies like Apple is high. So, for individuals, is it a healthy level to control the debt-to-equity ratio at 0.2?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: The higher the debt-to-equity ratio, the higher the ROE usually is, but this needs to be based on healthy debt. Healthy debt refers to debt that can be repaid through its own operating activities, such as credit, stock-backed loans (under safe circumstances), and mortgages (that can be repaid). Apple&rsquo;s debt-to-equity ratio is high because it borrows a lot of money to pay dividends and places assets overseas. In addition, it has a large amount of accounts payable. Therefore, it cannot be simply considered that a high debt-to-equity ratio is bad. It is necessary to analyze the nature and safety of the debt specifically.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Importance of Rebalancing:</strong> James stresses the importance of rebalancing at the end or beginning of the year. He recommends passive rebalancing, which means rebalancing when the market is performing well, to avoid panic selling during market downturns. He points out that many investors are reluctant to rebalance during market rallies, hoping to earn more, but end up succumbing to losses during declines and selling at the bottom, resulting in greater losses.</li>
<li><strong>Pledging Stocks for Tax Payment:</strong> He advises individuals with pledged stocks to borrow money for tax payments instead of selling the stocks to avoid increasing capital gains tax and to better utilize their funds. He emphasizes that under the premise of sound asset allocation and risk management, the borrowed money can be used flexibly.</li>
<li><strong>Real Estate Investment:</strong>  James advises against buying real estate, believing it restricts personal freedom. He uses the example of a friend in the Bay Area selling their property to support this viewpoint, pointing out the high holding costs of real estate, including property taxes, maintenance fees, and insurance, which can put significant financial pressure on individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Children&rsquo;s Education and Wealth Perspective:</strong> He suggests parents support their children&rsquo;s choices, believing that happiness is more important than wealth. Children shouldn&rsquo;t live for the sake of glorifying their family but should pursue happiness, serve others, and do what they love.</li>
<li><strong>433 Asset Allocation Plan:</strong> James recommends the 433 asset allocation plan (40% QQQ, 30% TQQQ, 30% Cash) for the general public, adjustable based on individual circumstances. For retirees who are not pledging stocks, he suggests an 80/20 allocation (80% index funds, 20% cash). For investors unfamiliar with or averse to leveraged ETFs, he recommends 100% investment in QQQ or 00662.</li>
<li><strong>Taiwan&rsquo;s Investment Environment Advantage:</strong> James highly praises Taiwan&rsquo;s investment environment, believing it possesses cutting-edge financial tools, tax-free policies, and low interest rates, making it an ideal place for investment. He encourages Taiwanese investors to leverage this advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Mid-Life Investment Strategy:</strong> He advises middle-aged individuals, even with modest incomes, to persist in monthly investments, accumulating wealth gradually for retirement. He illustrates the returns of monthly investments of 5,000 and 10,000 at retirement with specific examples.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of Nasdaq 100 Index Funds:</strong> James explains the rationale for investing in QQQ, stating that its constituent companies have strong profitability, focus on technology and innovation, and align with long-term human development trends. He also points out that the constituent companies of the Nasdaq 100 index have stronger profitability compared to the S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong>  He advocates for the &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, never sell&rdquo; strategy, ignoring short-term fluctuations and believing in the long-term upward trajectory of the market. He emphasizes that the purpose of investment is wealth appreciation, not short-term gains, and criticizes the drawbacks of short-term trading.</li>
<li><strong>The Difference Between the Rich and the Poor:</strong> James points out that the rich possess assets and credit, which they can use to &ldquo;print money&rdquo; through leverage for rapid wealth growth.  The poor, lacking investment knowledge, keep their money in banks, missing out on wealth growth opportunities. He uses the example of Warren Buffett issuing bonds to illustrate how the rich utilize credit for investment.</li>
<li><strong>Three Contributions of Investors:</strong>  First, allocating capital to the most efficient companies, promoting technological advancement; second, helping the government invest idle foreign exchange reserves; third, helping the poor activate their funds, maximizing their social value.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Shares a discussion with friends in Taiwan about QQQ&rsquo;s component stock adjustments and rebalancing mechanism, mentioning the Matthew effect and the idea that the strong get stronger. He also expresses surprise at the relatively small total market capitalization of QQQ.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comments: Suggests focusing on long-term performance rather than short-term fluctuations and explains that QQQ&rsquo;s smaller market cap is due to the relatively low number of people who understand and invest in it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 1:  The impact of QQQ component adjustments and rebalancing mechanisms on investments, and whether one should invest in the smaller 90 companies.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply:  Advises focusing on long-term performance and volatility, not short-term component adjustments. QQQ&rsquo;s adjustment mechanism ensures the inclusion of the best companies, illustrated by the performance of Mega 7 and MAGS. Points out the &ldquo;stronger get stronger&rdquo; phenomenon among large companies and explains QQQ&rsquo;s rebalancing mechanism.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>Question 1:  FNGS has performed better than QQQ. Can FNGS replace QQQ?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: No, because FNGS has excessive volatility and higher risk, illustrated by the 2000 tech bubble.  Emphasizes that asset allocation should consider volatility and maximum drawdown, not just performance. In the long run, QQQ offers better stability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: XLG has lower volatility than QQQ and decent returns.  Is it suitable for allocation?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: No, because XLG&rsquo;s long-term performance is inferior to QQQ. He provides a performance comparison of QQQ and XLG from 2006 to the present, showing QQQ&rsquo;s significantly higher returns. Emphasizes focusing on long-term performance and avoiding investments with poor long-term track records despite low short-term volatility. Investments with less than 30 years of market history are not worth discussing.</li>
