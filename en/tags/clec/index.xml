<ul>
<li><strong>Market fluctuations, international situations, market analysis, financial statements, economic situations, etc., are irrelevant to individual investment returns.</strong> Teacher James emphasizes that these factors are often overhyped by the media and financial institutions but have minimal impact on long-term investors&rsquo; returns. Investors should focus on long-term trends rather than short-term fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Investors should avoid being influenced by market noise and news.</strong> Misleading information in the market can easily lead investors to make wrong decisions. In the long run, these short-term fluctuations are offset by the market&rsquo;s long-term growth trend.</li>
<li><strong>Investment should be based on a strategy of long-term holding of the Nasdaq 100 index fund, without frequent trading.</strong> Frequent trading not only generates high transaction costs but also increases investment risk. The long-term holding strategy can reduce risks and enjoy the benefits of compound interest.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The risk of leveraged investing is lower than that of non-leveraged investing.</strong> Teacher James explains that those who use leverage have more cash reserves in times of crisis, making them more resilient than those without cash reserves. The key is whether the borrowed money is invested in the right assets, such as stocks of high-quality companies.</li>
<li><strong>Investors are advised to borrow early and incorporate the funds into their asset allocation.</strong> Early borrowing allows funds to be invested in the market, enjoying longer compound interest growth. Even keeping the borrowed money as a backup is safer than not being able to obtain a loan when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Newly listed funds have larger tracking errors; it is recommended to invest in established funds.</strong> Newly listed funds, due to their smaller size, require more hedging operations, resulting in larger tracking errors that affect investment returns. It is advisable to choose established funds like 00662, which have larger scale and smaller tracking errors.</li>
<li><strong>Asset allocation should be based on individual circumstances, such as the 433 or 442 strategies, with intelligent rebalancing.</strong> The 433 strategy refers to 40% core fund (e.g., QQQ), 30% leveraged fund (e.g., QLD), and 30% cash. The 442 strategy refers to 40% core fund, 40% leveraged fund, and 20% cash. Intelligent rebalancing involves transferring a portion of the profits from the leveraged fund to cash in rising years and transferring a portion of cash to the leveraged fund in declining years.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing should not exceed a certain percentage of total assets and should be combined with asset allocation to achieve automatic navigation.</strong> The amount of new borrowing each year can be gradually increased. For example, in the first year, you can borrow 1%-2% of the total assets, and then increase it slightly each year. The specific proportion depends on the individual&rsquo;s debt tolerance. In the long-term investment process, total assets grow at a rate of more than 10% per year, while debt grows at a rate of 2% per year. Therefore, borrowing money is very safe in the long run. Through intelligent rebalancing, the automatic navigation of the investment portfolio can be achieved without frequent adjustments.</li>
<li><strong>Investors should be extremely optimistic.</strong> Regardless of any disasters or market downturns, investors should remain optimistic because the market will eventually rise and break new highs.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Real estate is a high-risk asset, subject to risks such as windstorms, floods, earthquakes, and fires.</strong> In the United States, in addition to the above risks, there are also risks of tornadoes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters. These disasters can lead to significant depreciation or even complete loss of property value.</li>
<li><strong>In contrast, the Nasdaq 100 index fund includes 100 companies, does not require payment of taxes, maintenance fees, insurance fees, and is not affected by natural disasters.</strong> These 100 companies are among the best in the United States and even globally, with high long-term investment returns.</li>
<li><strong>It is recommended to transfer the risk of real estate to the landlord by renting instead of owning property to avoid risks.</strong> Owning property requires various maintenance costs, taxes, and risks from natural disasters. Renting can transfer these risks to the landlord, and you only need to pay rent.</li>

<li><strong>Investment should control emotions, understand history, and look at the present from the future.</strong> Investing requires rationality, avoiding emotional decisions. By understanding historical market fluctuations and economic cycles, one can better grasp investment opportunities. Looking at the present from the future can strengthen confidence in long-term investment.</li>
<li><strong>The value of the Nasdaq 100 index fund will far exceed its current value in the future, and long-term holding will bring substantial returns.</strong> With the advancement of technology and economic development, the value of the Nasdaq 100 index fund will continue to grow.</li>
<li><strong>The most important goal in life is to fulfill one&rsquo;s mission, not to pursue money, fame, and power.</strong> Money is only a tool to achieve life goals, not the goal itself. One should consider how to use wealth to realize one&rsquo;s life values.</li>
<li><strong>Money is a tool, and one should learn to spend money, especially for wealthy retirees; spending money is a virtue.</strong> Retirees should learn to enjoy life and use their wealth to improve their quality of life and achieve their life goals. At the same time, spending money can promote economic flow and create more opportunities for young people.</li>
<li><strong>Elderly people who have retired and are very wealthy should spend money as a moral duty.</strong> Spending money can stimulate the economy, allowing young people to earn more, and they may also consider having children and getting married.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>In capitalism, if you have money, buy index funds, and you will become rich.</strong> In a capitalist society, investment is an important way to achieve wealth growth. Due to their diversified investment characteristics, index funds can reduce risks and obtain average market returns.</li>
<li><strong>To become a millionaire, one needs to understand borrowing.</strong> Moderate borrowing can amplify investment returns and accelerate wealth accumulation. However, it should be noted that borrowing must be based on safety and controllability.</li>
<li><strong>Real estate loans require repayment of principal and interest, and retirees should avoid such loans.</strong> The income source of retirees is usually relatively fixed, and the pressure to repay principal and interest is greater, which may affect the quality of life.</li>
<li><strong>Convert mortgages to home equity lines of credit to reduce monthly expenses.</strong> Home equity lines of credit only require interest payments, not principal repayment, which can reduce monthly repayment pressure.</li>
<li><strong>The US borrows money to develop its domestic investment economy.</strong> The US can borrow a little more money and repay it in 20 or 30 years. In fact, the US does not want to repay the debt. It borrows new debt to repay old debt. The money is never repaid, and the currency will depreciate.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing without principal repayment is acceptable.</strong> Suppose you have 30 million in retirement savings, at 2%, you can spend 600,000 a year, or 50,000 a month.</li>

<li>Question: Details of the 433 asset allocation strategy, especially the specific steps for rebalancing at the end of the year, and how to understand the concept of &ldquo;automatic navigation.&rdquo; Many students are confused about how to readjust the asset allocation back to the 433 ratio.</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: When rebalancing at the end of the year, <strong>only the leveraged fund (Q2D) and cash portions need to be adjusted, without touching the core fund (QQQ)</strong>.
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>In a rising year</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the annual return of Q2D (year-end asset - beginning-year asset). If there were additional investments during the year, subtract the amount of additional investments.</li>
<li>Transfer 1/3 of the annual return of Q2D to the cash account.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In a declining year</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate 2% of the total assets.</li>
<li>Transfer 2% of the total assets from the cash account to the Q2D account.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatic navigation</strong> means that once the initial asset allocation and annual intelligent rebalancing are completed, there is no need to frequently monitor or adjust the asset ratio, allowing the investment portfolio to operate automatically according to the preset strategy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Share: Pin shared a book called &ldquo;Die with Zero,&rdquo; which puts forward a novel point of view: <strong>every meaningful experience in life is an investment, similar to financial investment. These experiences can bring spiritual returns, and these returns will increase over time.</strong> The book compares this kind of experience investment to financial investment. Every positive experience is like depositing the &ldquo;principal&rdquo; into the memory bank. Every time you recall or share these experiences afterward, you can get &ldquo;interest&rdquo;—happiness and satisfaction. As we age, these memories become more and more precious, just like compound interest in financial investment, whose value continues to grow. Pin took herself as an example. She decided to quit her job to accompany her elderly parents. Although this was a difficult decision financially, she regarded this experience as a valuable investment, and its return would far exceed the loss of money.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment: Teacher James agreed with Pin&rsquo;s sharing and further explained that <strong>the purpose of life is to convert material energy into spiritual energy</strong>. Money is just a tool. The real purpose is to obtain spiritual satisfaction and happiness. We should use money to create beautiful experiences, not just accumulate numbers. He took a chart in the &ldquo;One Billion Investment Lecture&rdquo; as an example to illustrate how to convert material energy into spiritual energy and emphasized that ultimately we should pursue spiritual abundance.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Three years ago, she mortgaged a house and borrowed 10 million NTD in a home equity line of credit, but this money has not been used. Now she has some concerns. After these three years, she wonders if she should be braver and use this money, but she is worried about her nervous personality.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James believes that Sunny&rsquo;s personality is too nervous and not suitable for complex investment operations. And pointed out that if you have a nervous personality, you are not suitable for investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Previously, she listened to some suggestions in the market and bought a large number of 20-year long-term bonds, resulting in a relatively high proportion of bonds in the current investment portfolio, and it is currently in a state of loss. Now that the market trend has changed and she is facing losses, how should she deal with this bond investment?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James pointed out that Sunny should not invest in long-term bonds and emphasized that funds should be concentrated on assets that can make money. He suggested that Sunny watch investment course videos to learn the correct investment strategy instead of blindly following various suggestions in the market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: Should she sell all the bonds now and transfer all the proceeds to buy QQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Considering that Sunny is retired and has a fixed monthly pension, it is recommended that she reallocate all assets (including bonds, cash, etc.), invest 80% of the assets in 00662 (Taiwan ETF tracking the Nasdaq 100 Index), and invest 20% of the assets in 00864B (Taiwan&rsquo;s short-term bond ETF, equivalent to cash).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 4: She still has 20-30% cash on hand. Should these cash continue to be invested in 00662 and 00864B according to the 80/20 ratio?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James আবারও emphasized that all assets need to be added up for calculation to ensure that the final investment ratio of 00662 is 80% and the investment ratio of 00864B is 20%. If the cash ratio is insufficient, she may need to sell some bonds to increase the cash ratio.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s additional explanation: Teacher James emphasized the importance of investment education and suggested that Sunny spend time watching course videos to systematically learn investment knowledge instead of just seeking a simple answer.

He realized that many people, including himself, are misled by the traditional financial system and engage in unreasonable financial behaviors such as forced savings. He believes that Teacher James&rsquo;s course system and philosophy are truthful and can help people achieve financial freedom.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment: Teacher James agreed with Zhang Yong&rsquo;s sharing and further explained the essence of the capitalist system and financial system. He pointed out that the history of the development of capitalism, especially after the Industrial Revolution, led to the emergence of the working class and gradually evolved into an invisible &ldquo;slavery&rdquo; system. The government, financial institutions, and capitalists have jointly built a &ldquo;Truman&rsquo;s World&rdquo; where most people live according to a set script without realizing it. Teacher James used the movie &ldquo;The Truman Show&rdquo; as an example to point out that this &ldquo;script&rdquo; was jointly set by capitalists, the government, and financial institutions to make most people become laborers and serve the capitalist system. Most people, including senior executives in the financial industry, do not even realize that they are &ldquo;actors&rdquo; in this system. Only a few people can see the truth and achieve true financial freedom. Teacher James emphasized that the purpose of his course is to help everyone recognize the existence of this &ldquo;scam&rdquo; and find ways to achieve financial freedom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: Many people are busy working and living, but their behaviors and ideas are contrary to the concept of achieving financial freedom. Most people seem to be misled by the traditional financial system and make unreasonable financial plans. Zhang Yong wants to know the essential reasons for this widespread phenomenon and how to change this situation.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James explained that the root cause of this phenomenon is the capitalist system itself. Since the Industrial Revolution, the capitalist system has gradually turned most people into laborers and built a complete system to maintain this state. This system instills the concepts of &ldquo;work hard, save, and invest&rdquo; in people through multiple channels such as education, media, and financial institutions, but in fact, it is &ldquo;enslaving&rdquo; most people. He pointed out that this is a &ldquo;war without sound and breath&rdquo; and most people do not realize that they are in it. Teacher James believes that to change this situation, we must first recognize the existence of this &ldquo;scam&rdquo;, and then gradually achieve financial freedom by learning the correct investment concepts and methods. He emphasized that we cannot change the entire system, but we can change ourselves and let ourselves and our families live a better life.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Tina has currently invested most of her assets in 00662 (Taiwan) and NDQ (Australia) ETFs, and plans to transfer her Australian retirement fund to NDQ in the future. She asked whether she should conduct asset allocation after completing all investments or start considering the allocation of other assets now.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James suggested that Tina conduct asset allocation as soon as possible, rather than considering it after all funds are invested in specific assets. He believes that asset allocation should be a quick decision-making process that can be completed within a day. For those who have not retired and have not borrowed money, they can choose the 433 or 442 asset allocation strategy; for those who are close to retirement or have retired, they should use the 80/20 asset allocation strategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: If according to the 442 strategy, Tina has allocated 40% of her assets to 00662 and NDQ, then after transferring the Australian retirement fund next month, should she invest in 00670L (Taiwan&rsquo;s leveraged ETF)? If the funds are kept in Australia, how should they be allocated?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James suggested that Tina treat the Australian retirement fund as a cash portion and allocate it according to tax factors. If in Australia, since the dividends of NDQ need to be taxed and the tax rate is high, it is not recommended to invest all retirement funds in NDQ. The Australian retirement fund can be used as a cash reserve, while the core fund (such as 00662) is allocated in Taiwan. If the cash reserve in Australia is not enough to meet the proportion of asset allocation, a portion of the funds can be remitted from Taiwan to Australia. He suggested that Tina consider tax factors and decide the specific asset allocation ratio according to her place of residence and post-retirement life arrangements.</li>

<li>Question: Wen Zhang&rsquo;s younger sister invested in a fund in Canada that tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index. The fund has a high management fee of 2.95% but promises to return 75% of the principal if the Nasdaq 100 Index falls. Wen Zhang&rsquo;s younger sister is worried that she cannot control her investment behavior and may buy and sell frequently, so she is interested in this high-management-fee but guaranteed fund. Wen Zhang wants to know Teacher James&rsquo;s opinion on this fund and whether there are better investment options.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James first pointed out that if investors cannot control their investment behavior, then investing in any product may face risks. He believes that the investor&rsquo;s mentality and self-control are the key factors for investment success. Regarding specific investment advice, Teacher James suggested investing in the Canadian version of QQQ, such as QQC or XQQ. These ETFs directly track the Nasdaq 100 Index, have lower management fees, and have higher long-term investment returns. However, Teacher James also emphasized that the final investment choice should be based on the investor&rsquo;s risk tolerance and investment experience. If Wen Zhang&rsquo;s younger sister cannot overcome the impulse to buy and sell frequently, then any investment advice may be invalid.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: Jenny does not have much money in her Roth IRA because her income is too high to contribute directly. She currently faces a higher tax rate and is considering whether she should convert all the funds deposited in her Traditional IRA (up to $7,000 per year) to a Roth IRA, even if she needs to pay higher taxes.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James thinks this is a good idea. Since Jenny&rsquo;s Traditional IRA amount is already large, she will face a higher tax rate when withdrawing in the future. By converting funds to a Roth IRA, she can enjoy future tax-free growth. He suggested that Jenny make the conversion, even if she needs to pay taxes now, but it is worthwhile in the long run.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: In addition to the annual limit of $7,000, can more be converted?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Yes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additional explanation: Teacher James further explained why a Roth IRA is needed. He suggested buying leveraged funds (such as QLD) in the Roth IRA and allocating an equivalent amount of cash in the Traditional IRA or other taxable accounts. This can reduce the growth rate of the Traditional IRA, thereby reducing future tax burdens. For example, if there is $500,000 of QLD in the Roth IRA, then $500,000 of cash can be allocated in the Traditional IRA. As the Roth IRA grows, the cash allocation in the Traditional IRA can be increased accordingly.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: Julie observed that the recent volatility of QQQ is relatively large, with daily gains and losses often exceeding 1%. She wants to know the reasons behind this phenomenon and whether this high volatility will continue in the future. She believes that the volatility of QQQ in previous years was relatively small, and there would not be such large daily gains and losses unless there were major events.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James first pointed out that Julie&rsquo;s observation has a &ldquo;recency bias&rdquo;, that is, people tend to pay too much attention to recent events while ignoring long-term trends. He showed the long-term trend chart of QQQ (including linear and logarithmic charts) to illustrate that in the long run, the volatility of QQQ has not increased significantly. The recent large fluctuations are because the price of QQQ has risen to a higher level, so even a 1% fluctuation is larger in absolute terms than in the past. Teacher James emphasized that a logarithmic chart should be used to observe long-term trends because the logarithmic chart can more accurately reflect the magnitude of asset price fluctuations.</li>

<ul>
<li>Share: Houqi shared the investment experience of a friend. This friend started participating in the company&rsquo;s 401k plan when he was young, but he didn&rsquo;t pay much attention at first, just investing according to the company&rsquo;s match. Many years later, he was surprised to find that his 401k account had accumulated more than one million US dollars in assets. This case illustrates the power of compound interest. Even small regular investments can generate huge returns after a long period of accumulation.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment: Teacher James agreed with Houqi&rsquo;s sharing and further explained the power of compound interest. He took the US 401k plan as an example, assuming an annual investment of 20,000 US dollars, calculated at a 14% annualized rate of return, it can accumulate to 30 million US dollars after 40 years. Even if calculated at a lower 10% annualized rate of return in the past, it can also accumulate to 9 million US dollars. This example illustrates that long-term investment and compound interest are the key factors for achieving wealth growth.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>People who borrow money are the ones with lower risks, and people who do not borrow money have extremely high risks.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because people with cash reserves can use funds immediately in an emergency, while those without cash reserves may face the risk of a broken capital chain. Those who have loans have more cash reserves in the face of crises and have stronger risk resistance than those who do not have cash reserves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A house is a consumer product. It is a kind of money-eating support, not an investment, and it is a very high-risk support.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentence emphasizes the attribute of real estate as a consumer product rather than an investment product, as well as its potential high risks, including natural disasters and maintenance costs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To succeed in investing, you must control your emotions. The first thing is to control your emotions. If you cannot control your emotions, please do not invest.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasizes the importance of emotional control in investing. Investing requires rationality, avoiding emotional decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In capitalism, if you have money, buy index funds, and you will become rich.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasizes that in a capitalist society, long-term investment in index funds is an effective way to achieve wealth growth. Due to their diversified investment characteristics, index funds can reduce risks and obtain average market returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to recognize that real estate is a high-risk support, so it is very strange that everyone thinks that directly investing in 100 companies is very risky, but buying a house with all their assets is also very special.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view challenges people&rsquo;s general perception of real estate as a safe asset. Real estate is a high-risk asset with risks such as windstorms, floods, earthquakes, and fires.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have been speculating, then you will go bankrupt in this market. There is no need to say that if you do too much, you will go bankrupt.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentence warns of the risks of speculative behavior and emphasizes the importance of long-term investment. Frequent trading not only generates high transaction costs but also increases investment risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Money is not our purpose. Money is not our purpose. The whole experience of life requires money. That is our purpose.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentence emphasizes the essence of money as a tool, and the real purpose of life is experience and spiritual satisfaction. We should use money to create a better experience, not just accumulate numbers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All passers-by, all the dogma of the financial industry are deceiving you.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Criticism of the traditional financial system and dogma. Only you don&rsquo;t know. Capitalists know it, politicians know it, but only the workers don&rsquo;t know it. 99.99% of the workers think that they are living in reality and in a real environment. In fact, you are living in a scripted life without knowing it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you start working today, then you can borrow $20,000 every year. Then how much more will you have? You will have an extra $30 million.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view quantifies the huge impact of leveraged investing on wealth growth. Moderate borrowing can amplify investment returns and accelerate wealth accumulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the power of compound interest, and let me give you an example. In the United States, 401K is $20,000. Suppose you invest $20,000 every year when you are young. With an annualized rate of return of 14%, in 40 years, you will have $30 million. You just invest without doing anything.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view reveals the great power of compound interest in long-term investment. Even a small amount of money can accumulate into amazing wealth through long-term compound interest growth.</p>

<p>Many of us spend our entire lives struggling with money, working tirelessly for monthly bills, children&rsquo;s tuition, and meager retirement savings, like a hamster trapped in a cage, running hard but never escaping. Have you ever considered that you could have been richer? Have you ever thought that the sense of security you seek actually binds you, causing you to miss out on greater wealth?</p>
<p>Yes, everyone has an innate talent for wealth, a right we are born with, as natural as breathing, as natural as birds flying and fish swimming. Unfortunately, this right, this talent, has been forgotten, or even buried by our own hands through the &ldquo;education&rdquo; of reality and the &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; of society. From a young age, we are told: study hard, find a good job, work hard to earn money to support the family. No one tells us: you can be very rich, you have the right to be very rich, you don&rsquo;t even have to work so hard to have it all!</p>
<p>The value of this lecture is far more than teaching you one or two investment techniques; its true value lies in awakening you from that “hamster dilemma,” making you realize your dormant wealth potential, and showing you a path to financial freedom. This path does not require you to have Einstein&rsquo;s brain, nor does it require you to have Buffett&rsquo;s luck, it only requires you to change your mindset, and then, to move forward steadfastly.</p>

<p>The extent of your vision dictates the height of your wealth. This isn&rsquo;t just some motivational slogan; it&rsquo;s a conclusion derived from rigorous logic and data analysis. Don&rsquo;t believe it? Let&rsquo;s crunch some numbers.</p>
<p>Many people find investing for something decades into the future to be too distant and unrealistic. But what if we look 60 years into the future? If you have 1 million now, through sensible investments and factoring in the power of compounding, you could have assets worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in a few decades. This is entirely possible; it’s actually a conservative estimate.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t ordinary people realize they can have so much wealth? The reason is simple: our concept of money is too narrow, we have insufficient understanding of our potential, and we lack a deep understanding of compounding, the &ldquo;eighth wonder of the world!&rdquo; Our understanding of money is still at the kindergarten level, while financial giants have a Ph.D.-level understanding of money, at least.</p>

</h3>
<p>Why is it so hard for most salaried workers to escape the &ldquo;rat race&rdquo; dilemma? Because they are trapped in a carefully designed cycle: you work hard for a month, and before the paycheck even warms up, it has to go to capitalists, the government, and the bank. For that meager salary, you have to work like a rat running tirelessly in a cage, never escaping that vicious circle.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that society constantly brainwashes you with &ldquo;consumerism,&rdquo; telling you that buying big houses, luxury cars, and branded bags is the standard for successful people. So, you&rsquo;re burdened with heavy loans, barely able to breathe under the weight of monthly interest payments. You don&rsquo;t dare to quit your job easily, and you don&rsquo;t dare to challenge your boss. You become a complete slave to capital.</p>
<p>Do you think this is your own choice? Do you think it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re not working hard enough? No! This is a structure intentionally or unintentionally maintained by the entire society and education system. What do schools cultivate? Compliant cogs in a machine, not independent-thinking creators. Financial institutions design complex financial products, ostensibly to help you manage your money, but in reality? They earn high fees and interest, while you can&rsquo;t even outpace inflation.</p>
<p>This “controlled environment” prevents you from realizing your potential for wealth, let alone changing your situation. You are like that hamster in the fable, the faster you run, the further you get from freedom.</p>

<p>Poverty is not your fault; it is the result of social structures that create class inequality. This structural inequality is like a thick curtain that obscures your innate talent for wealth, making you believe that you can only live a poor or middle-class life.</p>
<p>The statement &ldquo;wealth is a talent&rdquo; is not just a platitude, but a declaration, a solemn proclamation of your right! It tells you: you have the right to pursue a life of abundance, you have the right to enjoy beautiful things, you don&rsquo;t have to sacrifice your health, your happiness, or your dreams for money!</p>

<p>What is money? Money is a kind of energy, a tool. In a capitalist society, money can be used to exchange for various resources and services, including time, happiness, health, and even freedom. Money can also be used for investment, growing more money like seeds.</p>
<p>But remember, money itself is not the goal, but a means to achieve our life goals. We make money not to become slaves to it, but to live better, to realize our own dreams and those of our families, to have the ability to help those in need, and to better serve society.</p>
<p>Only by truly understanding the essence of money can we view it and use it correctly, rather than being enslaved by it.</p>

<p>Can ordinary people really achieve financial freedom? The answer is: of course they can! Moreover, achieving financial freedom is much simpler than you imagine.</p>
<p>The key to financial freedom is not about having a high IQ, or mastering complex techniques, but rather whether you have the correct investment mindset and whether you can persevere in executing it.</p>
<p>The path to financial freedom for ordinary people is actually very simple: choose the right investment vehicle, hold it for the long term, and let the power of compounding increase your wealth like a snowball. Specifically, it&rsquo;s recommended to invest in the U.S. Nasdaq 100 index fund, a relatively low-risk investment choice with excellent long-term performance. In the long run, its annualized return is considerable.</p>
<p>Many people might say, investing in index funds, isn&rsquo;t that something even an idiot can do? Yes, it&rsquo;s that simple! But the problem is, how many people can truly hold on for the long term?</p>
<p>Financial freedom is not achieved overnight; it requires patience and perseverance. In the course of investing, you will encounter all sorts of challenges and temptations, but as long as you believe in your choice and continue steadfastly, you will surely reach the other shore.</p>

<p>The biggest characteristic of the &ldquo;poor mindset&rdquo; is self-limitation. They habitually limit themselves with &ldquo;impossible,&rdquo; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; and &ldquo;too difficult.&rdquo; They don&rsquo;t see their potential or the hope for the future.</p>
<p>The key to shedding the &ldquo;poor mindset&rdquo; lies in changing your mindset and recognizing your wealth potential and rights. You have to believe that poverty is not your destiny, and that you have the ability to change your fate.</p>
<p>Specifically, you need to learn the right investment knowledge, rather than being led by so-called financial experts or the media. You need to understand that true wealth comes from long-term investment, not short-term speculation or blind consumption. You need to learn to delay gratification, using the money you save for investment, rather than for buying things that are non-essential.</p>
<p>More importantly, you need to cultivate the ability to think independently, not to be swayed by others or blindly follow trends. You need to develop an investment plan suitable for your own circumstances, and then steadfastly execute it.</p>
<p>Finally, you must remember that financial freedom is not something that happens overnight; it requires patience and perseverance, believing in the power of compounding, and adhering to long-term investment.</p>

<p>Why invest? The answer is simple: to make money work for us, not us for money.</p>
<p>Through investing, we can make our money grow continuously in the capital markets, thus realizing an increase in wealth. This increase can help us withstand inflation, ensure our future quality of life, and ultimately achieve financial freedom, so we no longer have to toil for a living.</p>
<p>Investing is also a way to plan for and secure the future. Through investment, we can accumulate funds for retirement, prepare for our children&rsquo;s education, and create conditions for realizing our dreams. Imagine, when you retire, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about whether your pension is enough, you can travel the world freely, do things you love, what a wonderful life that would be!</p>
<p>In addition, investing is also a way to participate in economic development. By investing in excellent companies, we can share the dividends of their growth, and also create value for society, promoting social progress.</p>

</h3>
<p>Why is it better to start investing early? The answer lies in the word &ldquo;compounding.&rdquo; Compounding, which Einstein called the &ldquo;eighth wonder of the world,&rdquo; is more powerful than you think.</p>
<p>For example, if we calculate with a 12% annual rate of return (a figure that can be achieved over the long term), a 30-year-old who invests $283 per month can accumulate approximately $1 million by the age of 60. But if they started investing at the age of 20, they would only need to invest $85 per month to reach the same goal!</p>
<p>See that? That is the power of compounding! The earlier you start investing, the less principal you need, and the shorter the time it takes to achieve your wealth goals. Because the effect of compounding causes your wealth to grow like a snowball, the longer the time, the faster the growth rate, and the greater the power.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if you don&rsquo;t have much capital right now, as long as you start investing early and stick with it over the long term, you can accumulate a considerable amount of wealth. Time is the best friend of investment.</p>

<p>Many people think bonds are a stable investment, and some even say they&rsquo;re safer than stocks. Is this really the case?</p>
<p>In the long term, bonds can actually be riskier than stocks. Don&rsquo;t believe it? Let&rsquo;s look at the data. How have different asset classes performed over the past 200 years, from the early 19th century to the early 21st century? The results show that the long-term returns of stocks are far higher than those of bonds, and bonds have sometimes even lost money over periods of 20 or even 30 years!</p>
<p>Why is this the case? Because the yield on bonds is usually low, making it difficult to withstand the erosion of inflation. Moreover, bond prices are affected by interest rate fluctuations and carry some risk. In contrast, although stocks fluctuate more in the short term, they have higher growth potential in the long term.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about real estate. Many people believe that buying a house is the most value-preserving investment, and some even consider their house their most important asset. However, have you ever considered whether real estate is really a good investment?</p>
<p>From an investment perspective, the main problems with real estate are its poor liquidity, high maintenance costs, and unremarkable long-term returns. Imagine if someone spent 10 million Taiwan dollars to build a villa 35 years ago, could that villa be worth 30 million Taiwan dollars 35 years later? It’s unlikely. However, if they had invested that 10 million Taiwan dollars in the stock market, based on historical average returns, the current value would have increased by two orders of magnitude, possibly becoming 1 billion Taiwan dollars!</p>
<p>More importantly, real estate also involves complex factors such as location and market fluctuations, all of which can affect its investment returns, and ordinary people find it difficult to control them.</p>
<p>And what if you treat your home as a place to live? Then you&rsquo;ll be burdened with decades of loan payments, and monthly mortgage repayments will weigh you down. For this house, you have to work hard, not dare to quit easily, and not dare to pursue your dreams, you become a complete “house slave.” Isn&rsquo;t that putting the cart before the horse?</p>
<p>Remember, a home to live in is essentially a consumption, not an investment.</p>

<p>For ordinary people, investing in individual stocks requires specialized knowledge and a lot of effort, and the risks are also relatively high. Is there a simpler, more effective way for us to share in the dividends of U.S. technological development?</p>
<p>The answer is: the Nasdaq 100 index fund.</p>

<p>These companies represent the future development direction, the future of technology, with strong innovation capabilities and huge growth potential. By investing in the Nasdaq 100 index fund, we are investing in these excellent tech companies at the same time, sharing in the generous returns from their growth.</p>
<p>Moreover, investing in index funds is very simple, transparent, and relatively low-cost, making it particularly suitable for ordinary investors to hold for the long term. Compared to actively managed funds that require a lot of time and effort for research, index funds often outperform in the long run.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq 100 index fund is more focused on the tech sector compared to other broad market indices, which means it has higher growth potential. If you believe that technology is the core driving force behind future development, then the Nasdaq 100 index fund is an investment choice you cannot afford to miss.</p>

<p>The method of investing in index funds is really simple: choose a good index fund, such as the Nasdaq 100 index fund, and then buy in regularly, holding it for the long term. It&rsquo;s that simple. You don&rsquo;t need a background in finance, nor do you need to monitor the market every day. You can even leave it untouched for years.</p>
<p>But why is it that so few people are actually able to do this simple thing?</p>
<p>First, it requires you to have a long-term perspective and firm conviction. During market fluctuations, especially when the market is down, many people feel panic and anxiety, and even doubt their choice, eventually giving in and selling, and as a result? They often sell at the lowest point, missing out on the rebound that follows.</p>
<p>Second, it requires you to overcome your human weaknesses. In the course of investing, you&rsquo;ll encounter all sorts of temptations: today, this stock has hit its limit up, tomorrow, that concept is hot, the day after tomorrow, experts predict the market will plummet… this noise will interfere with your judgment, leading you to deviate from your original investment plan.</p>
<p>Many people, even those who have learned this simple investment method, still cannot do it well. Some investors are impatient to sell as soon as the market rises slightly, missing out on the big gains that come later; some investors, although they have set a fixed investment plan, are always unable to stick to it, going at it haphazardly; and other investors, because they hold other types of stocks or investments, are unable to make up their minds to switch to index funds.</p>
<p>What does all of this show? It shows that the success of investing depends not only on the method, but also on your mindset, whether you can overcome your human weaknesses, and whether you can steadfastly execute your investment plan.</p>
<p>Investing in index funds requires &ldquo;patience&rdquo; and &ldquo;waiting,&rdquo; the determination to &ldquo;stay the course&rdquo;, which is what most people lack.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Financial Expert&rdquo; Scam:</strong> Many so-called &ldquo;financial experts&rdquo; are actually just salespeople for financial products. In order to earn commissions, they will recommend various complex financial products to you, such as insurance, bonds, annuities, etc. These products often come with high fees and less-than-ideal long-term returns. Annuity products in particular, are not only low-yielding and high-risk, but also severely impact your asset allocation and tax planning. Remember, truly good investments are often simple, and those complicated products are often traps.</li>
<li><strong>Noise from the Media and &ldquo;Experts&rdquo;:</strong> Many media outlets and so-called &ldquo;investment experts,&rdquo; in order to grab attention, publish all sorts of sensational market predictions. One minute they&rsquo;re saying a bull market is coming, the next a bear market is coming, and the next, that a certain industry is about to explode… This noise severely interferes with your judgment, making you unable to focus on long-term investment. Remember, what really matters is the long-term trend, not the short-term fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>The Temptation of Short-Term Trading:</strong> Many people dream of getting rich overnight, so they like to buy and sell frequently, trying to capture every market fluctuation. However, short-term trading not only requires you to have superb skills and keen market intuition, but also to bear enormous risks. For ordinary investors, short-term trading is often not worth the effort, and can even lead to serious losses. Frequent trading is like a gambler in a casino, often eventually losing it all.</li>
<li><strong>The Risks of High Leverage:</strong> Some investors, in order to pursue higher returns, use excessive leverage, such as margin accounts. However, leverage is a double-edged sword, it can amplify your returns, but also amplify your losses. If used improperly, it can easily lead to total ruin, and even bankruptcy. Remember, the first priority of investment is to control risk, not to pursue high returns. Never put your fate in the hands of luck, especially not with leveraged fate.</li>
<li><strong>The Risk of Not Learning:</strong> Many people know nothing about investment. They don&rsquo;t understand the essence of investment, nor their own risk tolerance, nor the characteristics of the products they are investing in. Such blind investment is like crossing the road with your eyes closed, full of risks.</li>

<p>&ldquo;Never sell,&rdquo; these four words, don&rsquo;t they sound a bit extreme? But they are the secret to enduring market cycles, the essence of long-term investing.</p>
<p>The essence of investing is to share in the growth dividends of excellent companies, not to gamble, in a casino, diving in and out. The logic behind &ldquo;never sell&rdquo; is actually very simple: as long as you are investing in excellent companies, and as long as you believe that these companies can continue to grow, then you should hold them for the long term, sharing in the dividends that their growth brings.</p>
<p>Frequent buying and selling will not only increase your transaction costs, but will also cause you to miss out on the compounding effect of long-term holding. More importantly, it will expose you to human weaknesses.</p>
<p>When the market is falling, you will feel panicked and will want to sell; when the market rises, you will become greedy and will want to chase after the price increases. As a result? You are often buying high and selling low, and are constantly harvested by the market.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;never sell&rdquo; strategy can help you overcome fear and greed, and allow you to always stay in the market, sharing in the dividends of economic growth.</p>

<p>The strategy of &ldquo;living off stock pledges&rdquo; can help you address your daily capital needs without selling your stock. This is a smarter way to manage finances.</p>
<p>Many people might ask, what is a stock pledge? Simply put, it is using your stock as collateral to borrow money from a financial institution. In this way, you can gain access to liquidity without selling your stock, and you can continue to enjoy the long-term appreciation of your stock.</p>
<p>Through stock pledges, you can avoid being forced to sell stocks with long-term growth potential due to temporary funding shortages. Furthermore, in many countries and regions, the capital gains tax rate is usually higher than the borrowing interest rate. Through stock pledges, you can also reasonably reduce your tax burden.</p>
<p>Of course, stock pledges also carry some risks. If the stock price drops sharply, you may need to provide additional collateral or face the risk of forced liquidation. Therefore, when using stock pledges, you must control your leverage ratio, and it is generally recommended that the pledge ratio not exceed 20% of your total assets.</p>

<p>In this age of information overload, we are bombarded daily with all sorts of information, especially in the field of investment. The opinions of various &ldquo;experts,&rdquo; various media reports, and various rumors, are difficult to distinguish between true and false, making people dizzy.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the ability to think independently, you can easily be swayed by this information and make wrong investment decisions.</p>
<p>Independent thinking is key to investment success. It means having your own judgment, not blindly following trends, not blindly believing in authority, and not being swayed by market sentiment.</p>
<p>The basis for independent thinking is learning and research. You need to continuously learn investment knowledge, study market laws, and understand the investment target. Only in this way can you form your own investment system and make correct decisions in the complex market environment.</p>
<p>Always remember that investment is your own business, and no one can make decisions for you.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Overthink Market Volatility:</strong> It is emphasized that ordinary investors do not need to over-focus on global affairs, short-term market fluctuations, company financial reports, etc., as these factors have limited impact on long-term investments. It points out that investors who frequently engage in short-term trading often &ldquo;pick up pennies and lose dollars,&rdquo; wasting both time and life.</li>
<li><strong>CLEC&rsquo;s Position:</strong> It is stated that CLEC (the club) is a non-profit investment and financial management channel that does not provide professional investment advisory services, nor does it receive any returns from members.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Warning:</strong> Investment involves risk; markets go up and down. Proceed with caution. Members need to conduct their own risk assessment and control and be responsible for their investment decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Asset Allocation:</strong> Over the past year, CLEC has continuously emphasized safe asset allocation, which is key to managing market risk and achieving steady long-term returns.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Video Resources:</strong> James has divided the four-hour-long video 00451 into short videos of about 15 minutes, making it easier for new members or those with limited time to learn. The short videos are subtitled in Chinese, English, and other languages to cater to members from different linguistic backgrounds.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended Learning Videos:</strong> It is recommended that everyone watch video 00451 for systematic learning. If you have time, you can watch videos 00398 and 00288. It is emphasized that investing is a field of study that requires continuous learning and practice.</li>
<li><strong>Necessity of Learning for New Members:</strong> For new members who have just joined CLEC, James recommends that they take the time to watch previous videos and systematically learn CLEC&rsquo;s investment philosophy and strategies to avoid repeatedly asking questions or making incorrect investment decisions due to misunderstandings.</li>
<li><strong>Answering Complex Questions:</strong> Some complex questions cannot be explained clearly through simple messages or emails. These questions often require a comprehensive analysis combining multiple videos and strategies, which members need to learn systematically to grasp.</li>
<li><strong>Refusal to Do Out-of-Scope Simulations:</strong> James clearly states that he will not consider scenarios beyond situation 1 to situation 9, nor will he do simulations outside of CLEC&rsquo;s investment framework for individual members.</li>
<li><strong>Global Investment Information:</strong> NASDAQ 100 index funds are available in many countries and regions around the world. James has compiled information from various locations into a document for members to easily access.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Context:</strong> It is emphasized that investments need to be viewed in the context of the current market, with a long-term perspective. It&rsquo;s important to believe that the market will eventually rise, investments require patience, and wealth accumulation takes time, using time to reap the great benefits of compound interest.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth Goals:</strong> James believes that CLEC members should all be able to achieve assets of over a hundred million in their lifetime. If this goal is not reached, it indicates that something might have gone wrong in the investment process, requiring reflection and improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Moving Toward Higher Goals:</strong> James mentions that many members&rsquo; assets have already exceeded one hundred million and are now moving toward the billion mark, which he is very pleased about.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Zealand Tax System:</strong> The tax system in New Zealand is similar to that in Australia. Even if stocks are not sold, tax is required on unrealized capital gains.</li>
<li><strong>Overseas Investment Tax:</strong> In New Zealand, unrealized capital gains from investments in overseas markets (such as buying US stocks like QQQ or NDQ) are subject to tax, with a high tax rate of 33% - 39%.</li>
<li><strong>Tax Avoidance Strategies:</strong> The USG fund issued in New Zealand may serve as a temporary tax avoidance measure, as investment in this fund may not require the payment of unrealized capital gains tax.</li>
<li><strong>ASB Securities Pledge:</strong> In New Zealand, ASB Securities can provide stock-pledged loans. The loan ratios vary depending on the fund. For example, some funds can borrow 65%, 70%, or even 50%.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long-Term Investment Wealth Expectations:</strong> James uses data to show that if you have 1 million USD now, long-term investment might turn it into 200 million USD; if you have 10 million NTD now, it could become 2 billion NTD in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Advocating Spiritual Consumption:</strong> James encourages everyone to engage in spiritual consumption, which are consumptions that leave no material trace and cause no environmental pollution. For example, the enjoyment of staying in a good hotel for a few thousand dollars may be better than buying a useless decorative item, as material possessions become old, break down, and are eventually discarded over time.</li>
<li><strong>Choice of Transportation:</strong> Whether to take a 40-minute bus ride or drive a 20-minute car depends on which method makes you feel more comfortable and less anxious. If it doesn’t cause anxiety, it’s a good choice.</li>
<li><strong>Reducing Material Desires:</strong> We should think about “what can we do without” rather than “what do we want.” Reduce our dependence on material goods, avoid buying unnecessary or excessive items, and focus on basic life necessities, such as healthy food.</li>
<li><strong>Rational Shopping:</strong> When shopping, rationally assess the practical use of the item and avoid blindly following trends in consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth Accumulation for Young People:</strong> Young people should try to reduce unnecessary spending and use the saved funds for investments to accumulate wealth more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Pursuit of Spiritual Eternity:</strong> Our goal is to pursue spiritual and investment eternity. Reduce material desires, simplify life, and use money for things that can bring long-lasting spiritual enjoyment.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Finding Connections in Life:</strong> In the vast universe, we need to find connections with ourselves and others, especially when we are old and living alone. This connection can be marriage, partners, children, etc.</li>
<li><strong>About Giving Birth and Adoption:</strong> James suggests young members should either have or adopt children because we have sufficient financial resources to raise them, form families, and that it’s a human right, so they shouldn’t give up on it.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Challenges for Retail Investors in Stock Picking:</strong> Retail investors picking individual stocks is like trying to find good fruit in a basket full of rotten fruit. The result is often that the more you pick, the more you mess things up.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Cutting Losses:</strong> James uses the analogy of a broken elevator to illustrate that if an investment is losing money, it’s better to cut the loss and get on a different elevator (investment) rather than to continue waiting or trying to fix the broken one. When investment goes wrong, one should cut losses decisively instead of holding or averaging down.</li>
<li><strong>Capital Safety:</strong> James advises investors not to send funds overseas, but to keep them locally or in Hong Kong for capital safety.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t Blindly Pick Stocks:</strong> When individual investors can&rsquo;t distinguish between good and bad stocks, they should avoid stock picking to prevent unnecessary losses.</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledging Limitations:</strong> Investors need to acknowledge their cognitive limitations and their ignorance; this is the essence of investment wisdom.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cautious Cross-Border Investment:</strong> James points out that if stock investments in Taiwan are not performing well, it&rsquo;s even more unwise to venture into overseas markets like the U.S., because competition in those markets is much more intense.</li>
<li><strong>Two Strategies to Address Losses:</strong> For investors who are losing money in Taiwan stock investments, James gives two pieces of advice: sell all individual stocks and buy 00662 ETF at market price, and hold for the long term; or sell all stocks and put funds in bank deposits, and exit the stock market entirely to avoid further losses.</li>
<li><strong>Contributions of Taiwanese Retail Investors:</strong> James points out that Taiwanese retail investors contribute over 150 billion NTD annually in transaction taxes to the government, so the government is motivated to encourage day trading and other short-term transactions.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application of Beta Coefficient:</strong> In the US, adjusting the portfolio&rsquo;s beta coefficient to 1.2 is equivalent to using 20% leverage for investments.</li>
<li><strong>Order of Leverage Use:</strong> James suggests that investors first adjust the portfolio beta coefficient to 1.2, and then consider using credit, mortgages, and other forms of leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Borrowing Investment Strategy:</strong> After borrowing, it is still recommended to invest according to the 442/433 asset allocation ratio.</li>
<li><strong>Opposing Opportunism:</strong> James points out that some investors are always looking for various investment techniques or shortcuts instead of learning diligently, which is not recommended. He emphasizes that there are no shortcuts in investing; only through systematic learning and practice can one grasp the correct investment methods.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long-Term Returns on Property Investment:</strong> James uses a property worth 5 million USD as an example. If this money is invested and has an annualized return rate of 14%, it could grow to 1 billion USD after 40 years, and save the 40 years of potential mortgage repayments and property maintenance fees.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Cost of Renting:</strong> If you pay 15,000 USD in rent per month, the total amount repaid in 40 years will be as high as 22 million USD.</li>
<li><strong>Depreciation Risks of Property:</strong> A house built 60 years ago may no longer be habitable. Similarly, a house purchased now may face the same problem in 60 years. In contrast, renting allows the flexibility to choose appropriate housing based on changing needs.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing 1: <strong>Convenience of Having Funds.</strong> Brian shared his experience of seeing a dentist in Taiwan. Since he had ample funds, he could pay in cash, unlike some people with limited finances who might experience delays due to cash flow issues. He felt the convenience of having funds.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Agreed with Brian&rsquo;s point, stating that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really good to have money&rdquo; as it can solve many problems and can even &ldquo;buy&rdquo; better relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 2: <strong>Taiwan Living Experience.</strong> Brian chose to stay at a hotel instead of with his parents when returning to Taiwan. He felt that staying at a hotel offered more freedom and fewer constraints. Furthermore, when eating out, he could pay for himself instead of his parents or in-laws, which gave him a sense of financial independence and control.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Suggests that family gatherings in Taiwan can be held in hotels, and if family members are willing, they can also stay at the hotel together, using money to obtain a more comfortable living environment and a higher quality of life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 3: <strong>Fund Allocation and Investment Strategies.</strong> Brian re-adjusted his fund allocation based on James’s investment philosophy. He found that even in the worst market conditions (e.g., a 20% market drop), his funds were still safe. He used funds from broker loans and investment returns and calculated that even after retirement, if he continues to invest a fixed amount each year, his “visualization rate” would not be lower than 200%. He believes the Excel spreadsheets provided by James are very helpful for understanding how funds grow and managing asset allocation.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Affirming Brian&rsquo;s approach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 4: <strong>Building Confidence in Borrowing for Investment.</strong> Brian believes that if he never uses borrowing, he might feel psychological resistance when he actually needs to use it. Therefore, he started to try using broker loans and considered reinvesting the borrowed funds. He believes that practical operation can help better understand how to use borrowing and find the most suitable way.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Shared his own experience, that he uses borrowed money as much as possible, rather than spending his own money, when travelling or eating out. He emphasizes that his assets will never be spent, and any income will immediately be used to buy QQQ. He further explains that buying 00662 actually helps the Taiwan Central Bank activate its foreign exchange reserves, reduce inflationary pressure, and also activate idle capital in Taiwan. However, safe asset allocation is a prerequisite for borrowing to invest. Without understanding safe asset allocation, one cannot use this tool.</li>

<p>Question 1: Regarding his fund allocation, should he put QQQ and QLD into a Roth IRA, and then use the borrowed funds for other investments, such as buying TQQQ, and whether his current fund allocation is reasonable and carries any risks?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regarding Asset Allocation:</strong> Brian&rsquo;s current approach is to invest some funds in QQQ, some in QLD (2x leveraged QQQ), and keep some in cash. James points out that when Brian&rsquo;s retirement account doesn&rsquo;t have much money, it is not very efficient or risk-free to pledge and put the money in the broker investment account, and to use leveraged funds (such as QLD).</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Black Swan Events:</strong> James emphasizes that Brian needs to have sufficient cash, exceeding the amount of his brokerage loans. This is to prevent &ldquo;black swan events,&rdquo; i.e., unpredictable major risk events.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended Asset Allocation:</strong> James suggests Brian puts QQQ and QLD into his Roth IRA account, and either keeps the traditional IRA account as cash or keeps enough cash in his brokerage account, ensuring that the cash amount exceeds the borrowed amount.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding 442/433 Allocation:</strong> James further explains that 442 and 433 are just references, and the specific asset allocation ratio needs to be adjusted according to individual situations. He emphasizes several key principles: have enough cash, and have more cash than borrowed money; the ratio of leveraged funds should not exceed the ratio of the original funds (such as QQQ). For young people, they can do a 442 allocation at the highest, meaning the ratio of leveraged funds and original funds are the same.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Allocation Adjustments:</strong> James points out that after allocating assets according to the 442 ratio, the ratio of leveraged funds will automatically increase as the market rises, which is normal. Because assets are increasing, and cash is also increasing, the overall safety is actually much higher than the beginning.</li>

<li>
<p>Sharing 1: <strong>Book Recommendations.</strong> Peter recommended two investment and financial management books: &ldquo;The Long Game&rdquo; by Nick Maggiulli and &ldquo;Atomic Habits&rdquo; by James Clear. He believes that many of the ideas in these books are very similar to James&rsquo;s investment philosophy.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Stated that the content of the books was similar to the investment concepts they discussed, and if anyone has time, they should read them as there is a lot of data that can verify our previous viewpoints.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 2: <strong>Building a Habit of Borrowing for Investment.</strong> Peter shared his experience with borrowing for investment, believing that it&rsquo;s a habit that needs to be cultivated. Only by being accustomed to this operation will one not feel unfamiliar or resistant to borrowing when assets reach a certain scale (e.g., 1 million, 2 million). Peter also mentioned that in the investment process, you need to construct two curves in your mind: one is the total assets curve rising, and the other is the total liabilities curve also rising, but the slope of the total liabilities curve should be less than that of the total assets curve. This way, assets will increase over time, while the proportion of liabilities will decrease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 3: <strong>Negotiating Lower Loan Interest Rates with Banks.</strong> Peter shared his experience negotiating lower loan interest rates with the bank. He mentioned that loan interest rates can be negotiated with the bank. He personally called the bank and successfully lowered his loan interest rate by 0.7%. He encourages everyone to not be afraid to try, to take the initiative to communicate with the bank, and to fight for lower loan interest rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 4: <strong>Understanding &ldquo;Owning Equity Means Owning the World.&rdquo;</strong> Peter expressed that he was impressed with James&rsquo;s idea that &ldquo;when you own equity assets in Wall Street stocks, you own the world,&rdquo; and the idea of &ldquo;never sell assets.&rdquo; He now understands the importance of owning equity assets and the meaning of long-term holdings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 5: <strong>Importance of Spiritual Consumption.</strong> Peter highly agreed with the concept of &ldquo;spiritual consumption&rdquo; put forth by James. He believes that traveling, good food, having more children, and being present in their growth, are all good forms of spiritual consumption.</p>

<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding funds management in Roth IRA and investment accounts. Terry mentioned that he has 401k, Roth IRA, and brokerage accounts in the US. He wants to know if he can use leverage in a Roth IRA account, and whether he must borrow via his brokerage investment account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restrictions on Retirement Accounts:</strong> James clearly stated that retirement accounts (such as 401k, Roth IRA) cannot be used as collateral, meaning one cannot use assets in retirement accounts to borrow. Only assets in a broker&rsquo;s investment account can be pledged for loans.</li>
<li><strong>Role of IRA Assets:</strong> James explained that while IRA assets cannot be used directly to pledge for borrowing, the amount of assets affects the interest rates of the loan. When brokers evaluate the borrower&rsquo;s overall financial situation, they consider the assets in the IRA account, which might lead to more favorable interest rates. However, the amount of assets in an IRA account does not determine how much can be borrowed.</li>
<li><strong>Calculating Loan Amounts and Interest Rates:</strong> James explained how loan amounts and interest rates are calculated. The amount that can be borrowed is usually 60% to 70% of the assets in the investment account. The interest rate on the loan is determined by a combination of factors, including the base lending rate, the size of assets in the investment account, and the size of assets in retirement accounts such as IRA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Can one increase income by selling Covered Calls for QQQ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opposing Covered Call Strategy:</strong> James explicitly opposed the Covered Call strategy that Terry suggested. He believes the strategy is not necessary and carries high risks.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Covered Call:</strong> James explained that if a Covered Call strategy is used and the market suddenly rises significantly, the options would most likely be exercised, forcing the investor to sell QQQ at the agreed price (usually below market price), thus missing out on the profits from the rise. Alternatively, the investor would need to pay more funds to repurchase QQQ.</li>

<li>
<p>Sharing: <strong>Recognition of CLEC and James&rsquo;s Investment Philosophy.</strong> Jason first expressed his gratitude to CLEC and James, believing that they bring surprises each year. From the initial advice of &ldquo;sell individual stocks, sell actively managed funds, and go all-in on QQQ&rdquo; to last year&rsquo;s &ldquo;asset allocation,&rdquo; this year&rsquo;s &ldquo;continuous optimization of asset allocation,&rdquo; and now the &ldquo;442&rdquo; and &ldquo;433&rdquo; allocation, James&rsquo;s investment philosophy and strategies are constantly evolving and improving. This has helped investors avoid external interference and truly achieve &ldquo;not being overjoyed by external gains, and not being saddened by external losses.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: When doing a &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; of asset allocation, if the predetermined ratios are not met, for example, if the ratio of leveraged funds has not yet reached the requirement of a &ldquo;433&rdquo; allocation, is it still necessary to perform &ldquo;smart rebalancing?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trigger Conditions for Rebalancing:</strong> James explained that if the ratio of leveraged funds has not reached the predetermined target, for example, the 442 ratio, there is no need to do &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; for the time being. You can wait until the ratio reaches or exceeds the predetermined target before adjusting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Regarding how to solve children&rsquo;s university tuition fees. Jason mentioned that university fees in the US are very high, especially for out-of-state students, where tuition and living expenses could reach 100,000 USD annually. Some of his friends are considering &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; some funds, such as by purchasing annuities, insurance, or transferring funds to others&rsquo; names to apply for student aid to alleviate financial burdens. He would like to know what advice James has on this matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opposing the Practice of &ldquo;Hiding Money&rdquo;:</strong> James strongly opposed the practice of &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; funds to save on university fees. He believes this practice is counterproductive and may even be illegal.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages of Annuities and Insurance:</strong> James pointed out that investing funds in annuities or insurance may reduce the amount of assets needed for disclosure in the short term, potentially qualifying for more student aid. However, it results in a huge loss of investment returns in the long term. He uses an example of 500,000 USD; if that amount was used for investments with an annual return of 14%, it could grow to 1.3 billion USD in 60 years. Whereas if that money is invested in annuities or insurance, the rate of return would be much lower, and the liquidity of the funds would be restricted.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Risks of &ldquo;Hiding Money&rdquo;:</strong> James specifically emphasized that transferring funds to others&rsquo; names, for example, to parents in China, and then having parents send funds back to the US annually, is suspected of money laundering and fraud, which is a serious criminal act in the United States. If discovered, there are severe consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Suggested Practice:</strong> James suggested that instead of &ldquo;hiding money,&rdquo; the money should be used for investments to grow the wealth. Even if one does not help their children pay for university fees, children can apply for student loans themselves. When they graduate and the assets have grown in value, one can use that to help repay the loans.</li>
<li><strong>Other Options:</strong> James also mentioned that children can earn some of their living expenses by working part-time or at a side job, such as driving a rideshare or doing other small part-time jobs, where they can earn tens of thousands of USD each year.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing 1: <strong>Personal Investment Experience and Confidence.</strong> Opa shared his experience of going all-in on QQQ. He bought it at the peak of the market, and although it declined for some time, his investment recovered to the previous high by the first half of this year and is now highly profitable. This experience has given him great confidence in long-term investments and a deeper understanding of bear markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 2: <strong>Daughter&rsquo;s Investment Experience and Transformation.</strong> Opa mentioned that his daughter previously had more faith in her financial advisor, and had given the advisor more than 1 million USD to manage. However, the advisor&rsquo;s investment strategy was too diversified, allocating assets across 20-30 ETFs, covering various indexes and small-cap stocks, which resulted in poor overall returns. Opa had been trying to persuade his daughter to change her investment strategy, but she would not listen. It was not until recently, after having two children, that she began to reconsider due to increased financial pressure. At a Christmas family gathering, Opa once again explained the power of compounding and the impact of the technology sector on productivity to his daughter. His daughter finally understood the importance of long-term and focused investments and plans to transfer about 2 million USD to a broker account that allows stock pledges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding the loan interest rate on 2 million USD in a broker account. Opa mentioned that according to the broker’s website, the loan interest rates for 2 million USD is still very high. He would like to know how to get a lower interest rate, and whether the loan interest rate is calculated based on total assets or the actual amount of the loan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Negotiating Lower Interest Rates:</strong> James first pointed out that loan interest rates can be negotiated with the broker. He suggests that Opa&rsquo;s daughter directly contact the broker and ask for a lower rate.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rate Calculation Methods:</strong> James explained that brokers take a number of factors into consideration when assessing the loan interest rate, including the borrower&rsquo;s total assets, loan amount, and duration of the loan. Generally, the larger the total asset, the smaller the loan amount as a percentage of the total asset, and the longer the loan duration, the lower the interest rate.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rate for 2 Million:</strong> James estimated the loan interest rate that Opa&rsquo;s daughter could receive based on her situation. He mentioned that the base rate announced on the broker&rsquo;s website was just a benchmark, and the actual rate would require further negotiations. He recommends that Opa&rsquo;s daughter directly contact the broker&rsquo;s staff member, Lisa, for a more detailed consultation. He also provided a calculation formula: 2.9% - 0.5% = 2.4%. 2.9% is the base interest rate for a 2 million loan in the brokerage, and 0.5% is the discount that Opa&rsquo;s daughter could get based on the size of her assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Regarding how to perform asset allocation. Opa’s current asset allocation is 811, which means 80% QQQ, 10% QLD, and 10% Cash. His goal is to adjust the asset allocation to 442, which means 40% QQQ, 40% QLD, and 20% Cash. He wants to know if it’s better to put leveraged assets (such as QLD) in the Roth IRA account, and the normal account in cash plus QQQ, to better maintain the correct ratio of the standard account during a bear market. Also, if there is a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; asset allocation plan, should all the funds in the Roth IRA be allocated to QLD, and the normal account to cash plus QQQ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interpretation of 811 Allocation:</strong> James first interpreted the meaning of the 811 allocation and said that there is nothing wrong with the allocation approach.</li>
<li><strong>View on &ldquo;Perfect&rdquo; Allocation:</strong> James believes that if one only has a Roth IRA account and a normal account, then it is acceptable to allocate all of the Roth IRA funds to QLD and allocate the normal account to cash plus QQQ.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility of Asset Allocation:</strong> James emphasizes that the specific asset allocation ratio should be adjusted based on individual situations. For example, it depends on the percentage of total assets that the Roth IRA account represents. If the Roth IRA account represents 40% of the total asset, then all the funds in the Roth IRA account can be allocated to QLD to reach the 442 allocation target. However, if the Roth IRA funds only account for a smaller percentage, say 20% or 30%, then the 442 target allocation cannot be reached, and the allocation will most likely be 622.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage Choices:</strong> James also mentioned that if one hopes to increase the percentage of the Roth IRA account to 40%, one can consider using 3x leveraged ETFs such as TQQQ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: Regarding the use of funds in his 401k account. Opa mentioned that he and his wife&rsquo;s 401k accounts are still in their respective company plans and cannot be rolled over until they reach the age of 65 (still two years away). He would like to know how to manage these funds now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Allocating Cash to the 401k Account:</strong> James recommended that Opa allocate cash to his 401k account, because the 401k account usually has some tax-saving policies. Keeping cash in the 401k account can take full advantage of these policies.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding QQQ’s Long-Term Investment Returns:</strong> James shared some data regarding QQQ’s long-term investment returns. He pointed out that QQQ’s annualized return over the last 5 years is approximately 19%, the annualized return over the last 10 years is approximately 17%, and the annualized return over the last 20 years is approximately 14%. He also points out that QQQ is accelerating human growth, and its future return might be higher and higher, therefore investments must be made.</li>

<li>
<p>Sharing 1: <strong>Observations and Reflections on Social Phenomena.</strong> Young shared an observation she made at work and in her life: many people work very hard in their respective fields and put in a lot of time and energy, whether it&rsquo;s running a business, working at a job. However, they do not give much importance to how they manage their money, or they don&rsquo;t know how to make effective investments. Young believes this might be because they do not understand investments, or they do not realize the importance of investments. She emphasizes that as long as one has the correct investment methods, they can achieve greater freedom in their work and life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 2: <strong>Risks of Insurance Products.</strong> Young has worked in the insurance industry for many years. She has come in contact with many clients and has seen many unreasonable insurance products. She gave a specific example: a client paid 500,000 RMB in insurance premiums every year for three years, totaling 1.5 million RMB. It has been 8 years now, and some years ago, this client borrowed over 800,000 RMB due to a cash shortage. If the client now wants to withdraw the policy, after deducting the borrowed amount, he can only get back 300,000 RMB. That is to say, he would still lose money. In addition, the client has never paid any interest on the loan. Young points out that the interest rate on policy loans in China is often 5%, while the return on the policy is only 3%. This means the interest paid annually by clients is far higher than the returns provided by the insurance company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 3: <strong>Agreement with James&rsquo;s Investment Philosophy.</strong> Young stated that she agrees with James&rsquo;s investment philosophy, especially the point that &ldquo;you shouldn’t try to make money that isn’t necessary.&rdquo; She believes that we should focus our primary time and energy on our work and lives, instead of spending a lot of time researching investment products such as stocks and funds. All one needs to do is to hold long-term investments in the stocks of the world&rsquo;s best 100 companies, and then spend more time enhancing our spiritual energy, being with our families, and enjoying life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question: Regarding the risks for clients opening an account in Hong Kong to purchase US Treasury bonds. Young mentioned that the interest rates on Chinese government bonds are very low, at about 1.6%, while the interest rates on US Treasury bonds are as high as 4.6%. Some people she knows are recommending that Chinese clients open bank accounts in Hong Kong, then exchange RMB into USD to purchase 5 or 10 year US Treasury bonds. She would like to know what risks are involved in such operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Need to Understand Specific Operational Details:</strong> James first pointed out that he would need to understand more specific operation details before he can assess the risks involved. He specifically mentioned that the normal procedure for treasury bonds does not require going through an insurance company, and he was unclear about the specific procedure and organizations involved in purchasing US treasury bonds, therefore he cannot provide concrete suggestions.</li>
<li><strong>Doubts Regarding &ldquo;High Returns&rdquo;:</strong> James expressed doubts about this kind of &ldquo;high return&rdquo; investment method. He believes that if there really was such a good investment opportunity, the insurance company&rsquo;s own funds would be invested, instead of recommending it to clients. He reminds everyone not to easily trust the so-called high-return and low-risk investment products, because there are often unknown risks behind them.</li>

<p>Question 1: Regarding asset allocation after retirement and calculating amounts for pledging and borrowing. Wave mentioned that she is planning to retire this year, and she would like to know whether she can pledge her stocks to borrow funds after retirement, and how to calculate the amount that can be borrowed. She also mentioned that her 30 year-old son would like to understand the issues of pledging and loans, and how to explain the methods of calculation to him, and where to find relevant information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation after Retirement:</strong> James first introduced two different methods of asset allocation after retirement:
<ul>
<li><strong>Not Pledging and Borrowing:</strong> If you are not planning to pledge and borrow funds, you can allocate 80% of your assets to QQQ and 20% to cash. Each year, you can use the cash part to pay living expenses, and rebalance at the end of the year, re-adjusting the ratio back to 80% and 20%.</li>
<li><strong>Pledging and Borrowing:</strong> If you plan to pledge and borrow funds, then you should adopt the 433 method of asset allocation, which means 40% QQQ, 30% QLD (2x leverage QQQ), 30% cash (or money market fund). Each year, you can borrow 2% of your total asset for living expenses, and also rebalance at the end of the year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Calculating Loan Amounts:</strong> James explained that the amount that can be borrowed depends on total assets and the type of asset. Generally, about 60%-70% of the total assets can be borrowed. However, different types of assets will have different ratios. For example, the amount that can be borrowed from QQQ is about 70%, while the amount that can be borrowed from cash and money market funds such as SWVXX can be as high as 96%.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding the Choice Between 442 and 433:</strong> James points out that for young people, 442 and 433 are both acceptable asset allocation options. The 442 allocation can achieve higher expected returns, but the risk is also comparatively higher; the 433 allocation is more stable. He suggests that Wave&rsquo;s son choose the allocation method most suitable for his personal risk tolerance and investment goals. If one plans to do pledging from the very start, 433 allocation can be considered, because the taxes paid will be less when making changes to the assets.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Learning Resources:</strong> James told Wave that he had organized and provided all of the articles and video links that covered the topics of asset allocation and pledging stock for loans, and she can find details on calculation methods and operation guides from these resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Regarding the view that “the estate will only be 1 million.” Wave mentioned that she recently saw a video by James that mentioned “the estate will only be 1 million in the future,” which moved her greatly. She believes that if one can increase one&rsquo;s wealth via borrowing for investment, and use that wealth for helping others during one&rsquo;s lifetime, that would be very meaningful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explaining &ldquo;Estate Will Only Be 1 Million&rdquo;:</strong> James explained that it does not actually mean that only 1 million will be left to the children as an estate, but that one should use investment loans to make the most of one&rsquo;s assets, so that one can do more meaningful things with the funds, instead of leaving all of the wealth to the children. He used an example of 300 million in assets. If 290 million are borrowed out, only 1 million will be left, but the 300 million in assets, and the 290 million in liabilities, can still be transferred to the children, and they can use that borrowed money and the rest of the assets.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Estate Planning:</strong> James also mentioned that in order to avoid high estate taxes, one can consider establishing a trust, and transferring assets into that trust, similar to how Buffet and Bill Gates do it.</li>

<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding the calculation and negotiation of interest rates on stock-pledged loans, and the impact of retirement account assets on borrowing rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Calculation:</strong> James explained that interest on stock-pledged loans consists of two parts: a fixed spread (also called fixed interest rate spread, which depends on the broker and borrower’s creditworthiness) and a floating rate (usually referencing SOFR, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate). For a loan of 1 million, if the fixed spread is 4%, the total borrowing rate may reach about 8% when combined with the floating rate.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rate Negotiation:</strong> James emphasized that loan interest rates are negotiable with the broker. He advises Julia to proactively communicate with the broker to negotiate a lower rate.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Retirement Account Assets:</strong> James pointed out that while assets in retirement accounts (such as IRA, 401k) cannot be directly pledged for loans, the amount of these assets impacts the borrowing rate. When assessing the borrower’s overall repayment ability and risk status, brokers will consider the assets in retirement accounts. If the assets in retirement accounts are substantial, the borrower might qualify for more favorable interest rates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: After opening an account, can one apply for a stock-pledged loan immediately? Will the borrowing limit be adjusted annually?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apply Immediately:</strong> James confirmed that one can apply for a stock-pledged loan immediately after opening an account.</li>
<li><strong>Limit Adjustments:</strong> James explained that the borrowing limit is calculated based on the asset value of the account, which will fluctuate with market conditions. Therefore, the borrowing limit is not fixed but is dynamically adjusted according to the market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: If there are investment losses, will the borrowing limit decrease?</p>

<li><strong>Yes:</strong> James clearly pointed out that if there are investment losses, leading to a decline in the account asset value, the borrowing limit will decrease accordingly. He gave an example: If there were originally 1 million in assets, the borrowing limit may be 700,000. If there was a loss of 300,000, leaving 700,000, the borrowing limit would become 490,000 (70% of 700,000). Brokers will re-calculate the borrowing limit based on the updated net asset value.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Adjustment of Borrowing Limits:</strong> James emphasized that brokers dynamically adjust the borrowing limit based on the real-time value of the assets in the account. This means if there are investment losses, the borrowing limit decreases. If there are investment profits, the borrowing limit increases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 4: What is the difference between stock-pledged loans and margin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Costs:</strong> James pointed out that the interest on margin loans is usually higher than that on stock-pledged loans.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Forced Liquidation:</strong> James explained that both margin and stock-pledged loans carry the risk of forced liquidation. However, margin has a stricter forced liquidation mechanism. When the net asset value of the account falls below a certain maintenance margin ratio, the broker will immediately force liquidation to recover the loan. Stock-pledged loans have a relatively more lenient forced liquidation mechanism. Brokers may give the borrower some buffer time or communicate with the borrower before forcing liquidation. Overall, the forced liquidation risk of margin loans is higher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 5: After borrowing funds, can they be used for investment?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No:</strong> James stated clearly that using borrowed money to reinvest in the stock market is illegal. He emphasized that brokers usually specify in the loan agreements that the loan cannot be used to purchase stocks or other investment products.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Violations:</strong> James explained that brokers can monitor the flow of funds, and although it may not immediately trigger forced liquidation, if such activities are discovered, it may lead to the account being frozen and loans being recalled with severe consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> James advises members to strictly comply with the broker’s regulations and use the borrowed funds for consumption or other non-investment purposes.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding the calculation of borrowing limits under a 433 asset allocation. Shawn mentioned that he is currently using a 433 asset allocation, which means 40% QQQ, 30% QLD (2x leveraged QQQ), and 30% cash. He would like to know if, when calculating his borrowing limits, the broker also includes the QLD component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>QLD is Not Included:</strong> James clearly stated that in a 433 allocation, the broker does not include QLD when calculating the borrowing limit. This means only the QQQ and cash parts are used to calculate the borrowing limit.</li>
<li><strong>Specific Calculation:</strong> James provided an example: If Shawn has 1 million in total assets, and the 433 allocation is 400,000 in QQQ, 300,000 in QLD, and 300,000 in cash, the amount that can be borrowed is 70% of the 400,000 in QQQ, which is 280,000, plus 96% of the 300,000 in cash (assuming the borrowing ratio for cash or money market funds such as SWVXX is 96%), which is 288,000. Combined, the total amount that can be borrowed is 568,000.</li>
<li><strong>Significance of the 433 Allocation:</strong> James explained that the significance of the 433 allocation lies in its balance of returns and risks. By allocating a certain percentage of leveraged funds (such as QLD), the expected return of the overall investment portfolio can be increased. At the same time, allocating a certain percentage of cash can reduce the risk of the investment portfolio and provide a buffer during market declines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: If the 433 allocation method is used and the total asset is 1 million, then borrowing 2% annually (20,000) may not be enough for retirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 Million in Assets Not Enough for Retirement:</strong> James agreed with Shawn’s point. He pointed out that if the total assets is only 1 million, even if 2% is borrowed annually, that would only be 20,000, which would not be enough for retirement.</li>
<li><strong>433 Allocation is for Total Assets:</strong> James emphasized that the 433 allocation is with regard to the total assets, not a single account. He advises Shawn to include all assets, including retirement accounts (such as IRA, 401k) and non-retirement accounts, in the 433 asset allocation framework.</li>
<li><strong>Allocation Across Different Accounts:</strong> James advises that QQQ and QLD should be allocated primarily to retirement accounts, because retirement accounts usually have tax benefits, allowing for tax deferral, thus enhancing the effect of compounding returns. The cash portion should primarily be allocated to non-retirement accounts to allow for ease of access when needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: Concerned about the possibility of hacking or accidental errors leading to the sale of QQQ; is there a way to restrict the selling of QQQ in the account?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Security Concerns:</strong> James stated he understands Shawn&rsquo;s concern because long-term holdings of QQQ, once sold, would lead to large tax burdens.</li>
<li><strong>Possibility of Restricting Selling:</strong> James said that he is not certain whether there is a function that directly restricts the selling of a specific stock in the account, as he does not work at a brokerage and is unclear about the specific operation permissions and function settings. However, he advises Shawn to contact the broker directly (for example, Lisa, whom he recommended) and inquire if they have the relevant settings or services.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthening Account Security:</strong> James emphasized that protecting the account is very important. He advised Shawn to take actions to strengthen the security level of the account, such as using a strong password, enabling two-factor authentication, and using a hardware security key.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Investing requires learning, new members need to watch previous videos to learn systematically.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The background of this idea is the influx of new members, who are asking many questions that have already been answered in previous videos. Therefore new members need systematic learning.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Acknowledging one’s own ignorance is power, and ignorance is wisdom.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The reason why many retail investors lose money is that they are overconfident, trade frequently, chase highs and sell lows, and cannot understand the essence of the market. Acknowledging one&rsquo;s cognitive limitations is necessary to avoid making rash decisions, and to make more rational investment decisions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s great to have money, you can use it to resolve worries, and to buy relationships.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is based on Brian’s sharing of his experiences after gaining financial independence, and his ability to spend his own money, and treat his family, which gave him more freedom and control. It shows the conveniences that money provides.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Humanity is growing at an accelerating pace, and investment returns will get higher and higher.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This conclusion is based on data on QQQ&rsquo;s past 20 years of investment returns, and emphasizes the effects of compound interest due to technological developments. Long-term investment in high-quality assets that are representative of the direction of technological development allows one to share the bonuses of human progress.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Encourage borrowing for investment, leave only 1 million in the estate, show respect.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is based on long-term investments, compounding returns, and sensible asset allocation, allowing one to maximize wealth, and to use loans to enhance one&rsquo;s quality of life, or to help others. With sensible asset allocation, loans for investment can accelerate the growth of wealth, and not simply accumulating wealth to leave to the next generation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There are no shortcuts in investing, only through systematic learning and practice can one master correct investment methods.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is a message to those who are trying to find investment skills and shortcuts, but are unwilling to learn systematically. Investing is a complex field of study that requires continuous learning and practice in order to improve one&rsquo;s investment expertise.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>When you own equity assets in Wall Street stocks, you own the world.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is an emphasis on the importance of long-term holdings of high-quality equity assets. Stocks are not merely an investment tool, but also represent ownership of a company. By holding the stocks of the world’s best companies, one can share in the wealth generated by these companies worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t try to make money that isn’t necessary.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is to advise investors not to over-pursue short-term gains while overlooking the value of long-term investing. We should focus our main time and energy on our work and lives, instead of spending too much time researching short-term market fluctuations or attempting to earn the difference by trading frequently.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The numbers 442 and 433 are merely references, and the specific asset allocation ratio must be adjusted according to individual situations.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is to emphasize the flexibility and personalization of asset allocation. Each person has a different risk tolerance, investment goals, capital size, etc., and therefore, they need to devise the appropriate asset allocation plan based on their actual situation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Protecting account security is very important.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This reminds investors to take account security seriously, and to take the necessary actions to prevent the account from being stolen or accidentally mishandled. Because if this occurs, it will lead to severe losses, and especially for long-term held assets, the losses would be even greater.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: The chaos in the domestic insurance industry, where banks lure customers into buying insurance with high commissions, is even linked to the performance evaluations of customer managers. Many customers do not understand investments and choose low-yield or even risky insurance products to preserve their capital. He also shared a case of a friend who was defrauded of over 1.7 million in a romance scam, illustrating the complexity of the domestic financial environment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment</strong>: The US financial system strictly separates life insurance from other financial businesses, and there is no such thing as banks selling insurance. The financial supervision in China and Taiwan is problematic. Banks should focus on deposit and loan business and should not be involved in insurance and investment. This chaos will ultimately harm the interests of emerging countries.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: Does Teacher James share content each week based on reflections on the same theme, or does he summarize viewpoints from reading many books?

The formation of monetary theory stems from thinking about the nature of capitalism, and the content of the handouts mostly comes from students&rsquo; questions and his own reflections. This information is endless. To be an excellent sharer, one needs to have basic knowledge, thinking ability, and originality.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: Took over the family food business ten years ago when the company&rsquo;s assets and liabilities were zero. After ten years of operation, the company turned a profit, and its current value (including real estate) is about 300 million NTD. Over the past decade, he distributed about 200 million NTD of revenue to his family, retaining 100 million NTD for loan purposes. Currently, he has invested 80 million in 00662 (a 2x leveraged Nasdaq 100 index ETF) and 20 million in 00631L (Taiwan&rsquo;s 50 Positive 2 ETF).
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment</strong>: None</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: The bank will allocate a loan of 60 million NTD on January 1st. Should this fund be used to buy 00662 all at once, or should he wait for a 20% market drop before buying? Also, if the market crashes and 00662 and 00631L go to zero, how will he deal with it?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: If the market goes to zero, the company can still make loan payments. The worst-case scenario is that the land is auctioned off, and he can still get tens of millions. Since the worst has been considered, how to buy the 60 million is not important. If it were me, I would buy it all on Monday. If you choose to wait for a 20% drop before buying, you can follow your plan and inform everyone when you buy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: How to maintain good health?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: Regular comprehensive physical examinations are necessary. I have been doing annual check-ups since my thirties. Wellness, like asset allocation, needs to be personalized. The advice I can give everyone now is to eat well, sleep well, and don&rsquo;t worry. What to eat specifically, what exercises to do, etc., need to be decided according to personal circumstances and cannot be given a unified recommendation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: What are your views on Taiwan&rsquo;s politics and how to support political parties?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: Regarding politics and religious beliefs, everyone has different positions and viewpoints. Discussing these issues in the classroom is meaningless and fruitless. It is recommended that students do not discuss these topics in the classroom and keep their opinions to themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 4</strong>: How to preserve assets in response to potential cross-strait issues? He currently has about 200 million NTD in assets in Taiwan and a house worth 8 million in Vietnam. How should he allocate his assets?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: If you can&rsquo;t sleep due to worries about cross-strait issues, it&rsquo;s recommended to immigrate as soon as possible. If you choose to stay in Taiwan, you need to make some decisions, such as whether to close the company. If the 40 employees are causing you distress, consider closing the company and compensating them. Life decisions should be decisive, not prolonged. Be responsible for your own happiness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Additional question</strong>: How to get rid of the shackles of the family business?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: You have managed the company very well. The choice is your life. Do whatever makes you happy. If the family business makes you unhappy, shut it down and give the employees a good severance package. Consider your own life, not your father&rsquo;s. If your father&rsquo;s business is no longer your concern, and it&rsquo;s not bringing you happiness, then let it go.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Repeated emphasis</strong>: Believes that apart from investment and financial management, health is the most important asset in life, and cited the example of &ldquo;Yu (Yuan) Lingqi&rdquo; to emphasize the importance of regular health check-ups, hoping the channel will pay more attention to health issues.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: Health is very important. Everyone&rsquo;s health condition is different, and it is impossible to provide a unified recommendation. Everyone needs to pay attention to and manage their health according to their own situation.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: Based in Canada, unable to leverage stocks. If income decreases in a certain year, and the tax rate drops from 32% to 24%, is it worth selling some stocks to increase income to the 32% tax bracket to improve the future cost basis?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: It is not recommended to sell stocks because selling incurs taxes. Canada&rsquo;s tax system is very unfavorable for stock investments. When immigrating, consider future generations and choose countries with development prospects. In Canada, you can consider using an IB account for loans, but this will face inheritance tax issues, possibly up to 40%. Therefore, when planning estates, minimize assets in IB accounts. In the long run, trusts can be used to avoid taxes. It is currently not recommended to sell stocks for short-term tax benefits. Consider selling after retirement when income is lower.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Additional explanation</strong>: IB accounts have a low financing ratio for Canadian stocks, only up to 50%.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s addition</strong>: You can borrow 40% first, and add more if needed. But ultimately, there will still be inheritance tax issues.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Through learning, I realized that my investment was too risky, and emergency funds should not all be invested in QQQ. Now I have withdrawn 36 months of emergency funds back to the Money Market Fund. When starting with small funds, one should focus on their main job and increase income sources. After investing in index funds, my mindset changed, and I began to focus on the importance of timing. Therefore, I started to focus on diet, fitness, and learning from the experiences of long-lived people around me. In addition, I learned from investing to avoid risks, such as giving up dangerous activities like diving.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment</strong>: It is wise to learn from the experiences of others. Being overly aggressive is human nature, but it is important to realize and correct it in time. It is wrong to increase positions when the market is rising and to be fearful when it is falling. It should be the other way around. Emergency funds should not be added to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How to judge whether you are being too adventurous? For example, increasing the leverage ratio of asset allocation from 1.0 to 1.8 when stocks are rising.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: This is also a necessary evil. Now that you realize it&rsquo;s not right, you can start to retreat, or when it rises, you buy in, and when it falls, you get scared. Oh, what to do? Then start to retreat. Once you have learned, don&rsquo;t do it again. So, as Buffett said, when others are greedy, you should be fearful, and when others are fearful, you should be greedy. That&rsquo;s the right pace. So, when you want to increase your position in the future, it should be when others are fearful. That&rsquo;s how I do it. This emergency fund should not be increased. Regardless of whether the market is rising or falling, you should not add to this cervical spine disease. How could you add to it? This is not allowed. Then, if you use our asset allocation, when the market falls, you automatically buy in for one year, and when the market rises, you automatically withdraw from the leveraged fund. This is passive, and this has already achieved the practice of being greedy when others are fearful and being fearful when others are greedy.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: The relationship between the asset-backed ratio and cash reserves. If asset-backed financing is carried out, how to ensure that the cash on hand is greater than the pledged amount? For example, with assets of 1 million, allocated according to the 721 ratio, 200,000 is pledged, but 100,000 in cash cannot be moved. Is it necessary to balance for one or two years to accumulate 200,000 in cash before making a pledge?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: You cannot borrow 200,000 all at once; you can only borrow 2% per year. When conducting asset-backed financing, the asset allocation should be 433, not 721. Borrow 2% each year and conduct &ldquo;smart rebalancing.&rdquo; Even if the market falls, you will not be forced to liquidate. The cash ratio may be lower than the loan ratio in extreme cases (such as a continuous 10-year decline), but since the total asset value is still greater than the debt, there will be no problem.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: Regarding 401k and RMD. Previously, company stock was placed in a 401k, and now it has a high value, facing the RMD issue. After Trump takes office, is it possible to abolish RMD and change it to a 15% capital gains tax?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: This possibility is extremely slim. The government is unlikely to give up the tax revenue brought by RMD.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Regarding the Debt to Equity Ratio of companies. It is found that there are large differences in the debt-to-equity ratios of Buffett and many technology companies. Is this related to the nature of the industry? For example, the debt-to-equity ratio of software companies is usually low, while that of hardware companies like Apple is high. So, for individuals, is it a healthy level to control the debt-to-equity ratio at 0.2?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply</strong>: The higher the debt-to-equity ratio, the higher the ROE usually is, but this needs to be based on healthy debt. Healthy debt refers to debt that can be repaid through its own operating activities, such as credit, stock-backed loans (under safe circumstances), and mortgages (that can be repaid). Apple&rsquo;s debt-to-equity ratio is high because it borrows a lot of money to pay dividends and places assets overseas. In addition, it has a large amount of accounts payable. Therefore, it cannot be simply considered that a high debt-to-equity ratio is bad. It is necessary to analyze the nature and safety of the debt specifically.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This viewpoint emphasizes that spiritual pursuits are more important than material ones. Giving and sharing can bring greater happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you, as a commercial bank, do lending well, then focus on lending. Deposits are 2%. Then your lending is 3.5%, 4%. You just make that 2% difference. This is what a commercial bank should do. Commerce should not touch insurance.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This viewpoint points out that commercial banks should focus on deposit and loan business instead of being involved in areas like insurance, which not only violates financial regulations but also harms the interests of customers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happiness is a human right. If you are alive, you should be happy. If you live so miserably, why bother?

</blockquote>
<p>This viewpoint reminds everyone to pursue happiness and not sacrifice their happiness for money or other goals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Learning from the experiences of others is a wise approach.

<p>This viewpoint emphasizes the importance of learning and drawing lessons from others&rsquo; experiences, which can help us avoid making the same mistakes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When others are greedy, you should be fearful; when others are fearful, you should be greedy.
&ndash; Teacher James, quoting Buffett</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very important principle in investing, namely, contrarian thinking, staying calm when the market is frenzied and looking for opportunities when the market is panicking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just be happy. There&rsquo;s nothing to it, nothing to fight for, no particular meaning, nothing that grand or great.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This viewpoint expresses a detached attitude towards life. Don&rsquo;t put too much pressure on yourself; learn to enjoy life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wait until it&rsquo;s too late, leaving no time for regrets.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drawing on investment principles, this perspective underscores the importance of early health screenings, urging not to wait until problems arise before regretting, echoing Xiao Cai&rsquo;s shared viewpoint.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We investors are always extremely optimistic. Market fluctuations should be ignored. The market will eventually rise and always reach new highs.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This viewpoint emphasizes the optimistic attitude towards the long-term trend of the market and the neglect of short-term fluctuations, demonstrating the proper mindset for long-term investors.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Importance of Rebalancing:</strong> James stresses the importance of rebalancing at the end or beginning of the year. He recommends passive rebalancing, which means rebalancing when the market is performing well, to avoid panic selling during market downturns. He points out that many investors are reluctant to rebalance during market rallies, hoping to earn more, but end up succumbing to losses during declines and selling at the bottom, resulting in greater losses.</li>
<li><strong>Pledging Stocks for Tax Payment:</strong> He advises individuals with pledged stocks to borrow money for tax payments instead of selling the stocks to avoid increasing capital gains tax and to better utilize their funds. He emphasizes that under the premise of sound asset allocation and risk management, the borrowed money can be used flexibly.</li>
<li><strong>Real Estate Investment:</strong>  James advises against buying real estate, believing it restricts personal freedom. He uses the example of a friend in the Bay Area selling their property to support this viewpoint, pointing out the high holding costs of real estate, including property taxes, maintenance fees, and insurance, which can put significant financial pressure on individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Children&rsquo;s Education and Wealth Perspective:</strong> He suggests parents support their children&rsquo;s choices, believing that happiness is more important than wealth. Children shouldn&rsquo;t live for the sake of glorifying their family but should pursue happiness, serve others, and do what they love.</li>
<li><strong>433 Asset Allocation Plan:</strong> James recommends the 433 asset allocation plan (40% QQQ, 30% TQQQ, 30% Cash) for the general public, adjustable based on individual circumstances. For retirees who are not pledging stocks, he suggests an 80/20 allocation (80% index funds, 20% cash). For investors unfamiliar with or averse to leveraged ETFs, he recommends 100% investment in QQQ or 00662.</li>
<li><strong>Taiwan&rsquo;s Investment Environment Advantage:</strong> James highly praises Taiwan&rsquo;s investment environment, believing it possesses cutting-edge financial tools, tax-free policies, and low interest rates, making it an ideal place for investment. He encourages Taiwanese investors to leverage this advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Mid-Life Investment Strategy:</strong> He advises middle-aged individuals, even with modest incomes, to persist in monthly investments, accumulating wealth gradually for retirement. He illustrates the returns of monthly investments of 5,000 and 10,000 at retirement with specific examples.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of Nasdaq 100 Index Funds:</strong> James explains the rationale for investing in QQQ, stating that its constituent companies have strong profitability, focus on technology and innovation, and align with long-term human development trends. He also points out that the constituent companies of the Nasdaq 100 index have stronger profitability compared to the S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong>  He advocates for the &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, never sell&rdquo; strategy, ignoring short-term fluctuations and believing in the long-term upward trajectory of the market. He emphasizes that the purpose of investment is wealth appreciation, not short-term gains, and criticizes the drawbacks of short-term trading.</li>
<li><strong>The Difference Between the Rich and the Poor:</strong> James points out that the rich possess assets and credit, which they can use to &ldquo;print money&rdquo; through leverage for rapid wealth growth.  The poor, lacking investment knowledge, keep their money in banks, missing out on wealth growth opportunities. He uses the example of Warren Buffett issuing bonds to illustrate how the rich utilize credit for investment.</li>
<li><strong>Three Contributions of Investors:</strong>  First, allocating capital to the most efficient companies, promoting technological advancement; second, helping the government invest idle foreign exchange reserves; third, helping the poor activate their funds, maximizing their social value.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Shares a discussion with friends in Taiwan about QQQ&rsquo;s component stock adjustments and rebalancing mechanism, mentioning the Matthew effect and the idea that the strong get stronger. He also expresses surprise at the relatively small total market capitalization of QQQ.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comments: Suggests focusing on long-term performance rather than short-term fluctuations and explains that QQQ&rsquo;s smaller market cap is due to the relatively low number of people who understand and invest in it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 1:  The impact of QQQ component adjustments and rebalancing mechanisms on investments, and whether one should invest in the smaller 90 companies.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply:  Advises focusing on long-term performance and volatility, not short-term component adjustments. QQQ&rsquo;s adjustment mechanism ensures the inclusion of the best companies, illustrated by the performance of Mega 7 and MAGS. Points out the &ldquo;stronger get stronger&rdquo; phenomenon among large companies and explains QQQ&rsquo;s rebalancing mechanism.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>Question 1:  FNGS has performed better than QQQ. Can FNGS replace QQQ?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: No, because FNGS has excessive volatility and higher risk, illustrated by the 2000 tech bubble.  Emphasizes that asset allocation should consider volatility and maximum drawdown, not just performance. In the long run, QQQ offers better stability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: XLG has lower volatility than QQQ and decent returns.  Is it suitable for allocation?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: No, because XLG&rsquo;s long-term performance is inferior to QQQ. He provides a performance comparison of QQQ and XLG from 2006 to the present, showing QQQ&rsquo;s significantly higher returns. Emphasizes focusing on long-term performance and avoiding investments with poor long-term track records despite low short-term volatility. Investments with less than 30 years of market history are not worth discussing.</li>

<p>This session revolves around investment and life wisdom. The core idea is to maintain a long-term perspective on investments, avoid being influenced by short-term market fluctuations, and continuously learn from life experiences to form one&rsquo;s own investment philosophy and life wisdom.  Just like life, investment also requires continuous learning and reflection.</p>

<ul>
<li>People nearing retirement can consider using a revolving line of credit home loan (HELOC), treating the credit line as a part of their cash reserves for living expenses without touching the principal investment, thereby increasing overall asset returns.  For example, if someone has $40 million in retirement funds and obtains a $10 million HELOC, the total assets become $50 million, and the annual disposable funds increase from $800,000 to $1 million.</li>
<li>The HELOC credit line can supplement the 20% cash portion of asset allocation.</li>
<li>Note: It&rsquo;s easier to obtain a HELOC before retirement; it becomes more difficult afterward. The loan term typically doesn&rsquo;t exceed age 90.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not recommended to take out a loan after retirement to repay the HELOC.</li>
<li>A listener shared a strategy of using a HELOC for living expenses, which James considers a good option.</li>

<li>In the age of AI, human development will accelerate, and the market will continue to rise. The next two to three decades will be a period of prosperity. QQQ might reach $500,000.</li>
<li>Focus on long-term trends in investing. Don&rsquo;t be swayed by short-term market analysts or news.  Focus on long-term growth, not short-term gains.</li>
<li>If you can&rsquo;t withstand a 50% loss, it&rsquo;s not recommended to enter the market.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing:  Shared her experience of investing most of her retirement funds in savings insurance a few years ago, resulting in much lower returns than expected. This year, she redeemed a portion of the funds and invested in QQQ, achieving better returns (13.68% in three months). However, with the current market reaching new highs, she&rsquo;s hesitant to invest further, finding it difficult to overcome the psychological barrier of &ldquo;buying with eyes closed.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: Courage comes from the subconscious and requires training.  Believe that the market will continue to rise and practice self-hypnosis to reinforce the &ldquo;buy when you have money&rdquo; concept. Used the example of QQQ potentially reaching $500,000 to illustrate that the current price is still very cheap.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: After following James&rsquo;s advice, she redeemed funds from savings insurance and invested in QQQ and QLD. However, due to insufficient trading frequency, she couldn&rsquo;t purchase QQQ 2D. Her current living expenses are primarily covered by alimony, and the cost of living in Taiwan is relatively low.</li>
<li>Question 1: Does she need to buy and sell repeatedly to meet the trading frequency requirement?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes, she can make small, frequent trades to meet the brokerage&rsquo;s requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Can she buy fractional shares in Taiwan?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes, but it&rsquo;s recommended to buy whole shares first and use the remaining funds for fractional shares.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: How to calculate retirement fund needs?  Can she receive social security?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Calculate retirement fund needs based on annual expenses. Alimony can be considered income, but it&rsquo;s recommended to claim social security (even if her ex-husband objects) and adjust the asset allocation ratio accordingly, as alimony is not a permanent income source. She needs to be prepared.  Also recommended switching from SWVXX to BOXX.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: Discussed the psychological pressure of buying after a stock reaches new highs. Experienced investors feel more pressure due to having reference points, while newcomers are more receptive. Like buying discounted items in a supermarket, having the original price as a reference makes purchasing more appealing.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Shared his views on two newly issued ETFs by Invesco (QBI and QQLV) and compared them to QQQ. QBI selects larger market cap stocks from QQQ, while QQLV selects stocks with lower volatility.</li>
<li>Question: What are James&rsquo;s views on these two new ETFs?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Doesn&rsquo;t recommend investing in unfamiliar ETFs, even if they perform well.  Stick to investments within your circle of competence.

<p>The market continues to reach new highs.  Investing doesn&rsquo;t require constant attention; the key is to stick to a long-term investment strategy, maintain a well-diversified asset allocation, and remain patient. The real risk isn&rsquo;t short-term volatility, but the inability to accumulate sufficient wealth over the long term, and not knowing how to utilize accumulated wealth effectively.  Furthermore, it&rsquo;s crucial to be wary of various financial traps and maintain rational investment practices.</p>

<ul>
<li>The market is at a new high. Don&rsquo;t waste time over-analyzing; stick to long-term investing, buy and hold.  The market generally trends upwards; instead of predicting pullbacks, enter the market early.</li>
<li>Investing doesn&rsquo;t require excessive time. After placing your order, step away and let time work its magic through compounding.</li>
<li>Be wary of scams. Don&rsquo;t trust any investment advice that guarantees stable returns or daily gains.  Be extremely cautious of &ldquo;guaranteed profit&rdquo; schemes.</li>
<li>Ignore the advice of financial advisors and insurance agents. They rarely have the investor&rsquo;s best interests at heart and are often motivated by their own profits. Many financial products are designed to benefit the seller, not the investor.</li>
<li>Investing isn&rsquo;t simple. Even asset allocation within a Nasdaq 100 index fund requires in-depth research and adjustments based on individual circumstances.</li>
<li>Investors should always remain optimistic. The market will eventually rise. Patiently await wealth accumulation. Time is an investor&rsquo;s friend.</li>

<ul>
<li>The biggest risks are not market fluctuations, but the failure to accumulate sufficient wealth over the long term and not knowing how to utilize accumulated wealth effectively. The ultimate goal of investing is to achieve financial freedom and enjoy life.</li>
<li>Avoid the instinctive reaction to short-term losses. Overcome fear and don&rsquo;t panic sell. Market downturns are normal and present buying opportunities.</li>
<li>View bear markets as opportunities. Buying low translates to higher future returns. Learn to think contrarily and utilize market fluctuations for mindless rebalancing.</li>
<li>The investment objective is to mitigate the risk of financial hardship, not to maximize returns. A sound investment strategy is more crucial than chasing high returns.</li>
<li>Choose a simple, low-cost, passive index investment strategy, such as a Nasdaq 100 index fund, and hold a portion in cash to maintain psychological balance and cope with market volatility.</li>
<li>Holding safe assets (like certificates of deposit and money market funds) can mitigate short-term risks, stabilize emotions during market fluctuations, and provide a sense of security.</li>
<li>The proportion of safe assets held should be adjusted based on age and risk tolerance. Retirees are advised to hold cash equivalent to 5 years of living expenses, while those yet to retire can hold more.</li>
<li>Young people should prioritize term life insurance to protect their families and avoid other types of insurance to prevent being misled by insurance companies.</li>

<p>&ldquo;The first investment earns the most; that performance can never be replicated.&rdquo;

<p>This lecture focuses on the importance of long-term investing and asset allocation, especially the significance of holding cash (undamaged capital). James reiterates the idea that &ldquo;the only constant in the market is volatility&rdquo; and advises investors to adopt a &ldquo;buy and hold&rdquo; strategy similar to Warren Buffett&rsquo;s, investing long-term in Nasdaq 100 index funds (QQQ or 00662). He uses a rent vs. buy case study to demonstrate the advantages of long-term index fund investing. He also explains in detail the importance of maintaining undamaged capital (cash) in asset allocation to buy the dip during market downturns, thereby achieving long-term stable investment returns.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Long-term Holding:</strong> Investing requires a timeframe of 20+ years, ideally forever, without worrying about short-term market fluctuations. James uses Warren Buffett as an example, emphasizing the importance of long-term holding, stating that if one isn&rsquo;t prepared to hold for the long term, they shouldn&rsquo;t even hold for 10 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in the US:</strong> The US is the best country for fairness, justice, and open innovation, so invest only in the US.</li>
<li><strong>Index Funds:</strong> Invest in Nasdaq 100 index funds (QQQ/00662), and recommends new viewers watch introductory videos 00451, 288, and 398.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility:</strong> The only constant in the market is volatility. Ignore market fluctuations and adhere to long-term holding. The 2022 market correction was just a financial event, not a bubble.</li>
<li><strong>Bubbles:</strong> Bubbles are rare, occurring only twice in the past 25 years. The best way to deal with them is to ignore them and continue holding index funds.</li>

<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> Recommends a cash allocation of at least 20% in the portfolio.</li>
<li><strong>Retirement Planning:</strong>  To withdraw $30,000 annually from an investment account after retirement, $1.5 million in cash is needed. James suggests withdrawing $50,000 annually, requiring $2.5 million in cash, approximately 20% of total assets.</li>

<li><strong>Renting is Superior to Buying:</strong>  In the long run, renting and investing in index funds yields higher returns than buying a house. James shares a PC Excel spreadsheet example demonstrating the advantages of rental investment and encourages viewers to modify the parameters for simulation calculations.</li>
<li><strong>Selling Advice:</strong> Recommends selling real estate and land, investing the funds in the stock market. There&rsquo;s no real estate that can&rsquo;t be sold, only prices that are too high. Even if sold at a lower price, investment returns may quickly compensate for the difference.</li>
<li><strong>Short-term Rental Investment:</strong>  Short-term rental investments aren&rsquo;t worthwhile unless the annualized return is at least 20%.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1: How can I deduct the interest on a pledged loan against the interest earned on cash holdings?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>James:</strong> There&rsquo;s no deduction. If the interest earned on your cash is higher than the loan interest, you&rsquo;re effectively earning more. I recommend buying non-dividend-paying stocks in your personal account, like BOXX, to avoid paying taxes on interest income. Since you don&rsquo;t have a Roth IRA, you can only operate within a brokerage account and will incur some tax costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2: Which trading software do you recommend?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>James:</strong>  Just use your broker&rsquo;s website; no need for additional software. I only use the web version. The &ldquo;positions&rdquo; page on your brokerage website allows you to view the profit and loss of each transaction and manage them in batches.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Comment 1: There&rsquo;s a significant wealth gap among young people, and some try to fill it by borrowing money. How can I avoid this trap?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>James:</strong> First, cultivate strong mental fortitude, which can be achieved through reading. Second, don&rsquo;t lend money casually. Third, don&rsquo;t buy things you don&rsquo;t need. Even Warren Buffett, despite his wealth, doesn&rsquo;t buy unnecessary things.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Comment 2: I participated in an 11-day meditation retreat and gained insights into the relationship between meditation and investing, particularly the importance of focus.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>James:</strong> Avoid distractions outside the stock market and focus on your investment strategy.  Treat distractions like &ldquo;demons and monsters&rdquo;—don&rsquo;t listen, don&rsquo;t watch, don&rsquo;t engage—and you&rsquo;ll maintain composure.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Question: Does focusing solely on my own investments lead to detachment from the world?</strong>

<li><strong>James:</strong> Since you&rsquo;re still working, you don&rsquo;t need to engage in complex rebalancing.  Just rebalance annually, adjusting the proportions of leveraged ETFs (00670L/TQQQ/Q2D) and cash. You can leave your 00662/QQQ holdings untouched. Alternatively, during your monthly investments, maintain an 80% allocation to 00662/QQQ and 20% to 00864B/cash.  (He then provides a specific example of adjusting the ratio between 00670L and cash).</li>

You can invest in leveraged ETFs within the Roth IRA and hold cash in your traditional retirement account to lower your overall return and tax burden.  Start converting to a Roth IRA as soon as possible; don&rsquo;t wait until RMDs begin.</li>

<p>This session revolves around investment and life planning. The core ideas are: be optimistic about investment and keep learning, ignoring short-term market fluctuations; young people should focus on asset appreciation, with Nasdaq 100 index funds being the top choice; utilize leverage and allocate assets reasonably; retirees should plan carefully and avoid excessive debt; and one should stay optimistic and confident, avoid material comparisons, and pursue true freedom.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market Fluctuations and Investment Mentality:</strong> The market is always fluctuating. Don&rsquo;t let short-term fluctuations affect your investment decisions. Stay optimistic.</li>
<li><strong>Currency Devaluation and Asset Appreciation:</strong> Money depreciates; only assets like stocks can preserve and increase in value. Currency devaluation is more severe in emerging countries, so it is advised to convert currency into assets. Taiwan&rsquo;s low wages and currency devaluation are related to the government&rsquo;s subsidy policies.</li>
<li><strong>Worker Mindset vs. Capitalist Mindset:</strong> Workers exchange labor for depreciating currency, while capitalists exchange currency for appreciating assets. Learn to invest and become a capitalist, exchanging &ldquo;trash&rdquo; (depreciating currency) for assets.</li>
<li><strong>Global Market Linkage:</strong> Global markets are highly interconnected, and diversifying investments into other regions has limited effectiveness. Focusing on the US stock market is recommended.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nasdaq 100 Index Funds:</strong> The preferred choice for young people. Long-term investment can yield substantial returns.  Global codes for purchasing Nasdaq 100 index funds were provided, and investing based on market conditions is recommended.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Cash:</strong> Cash reserves are crucial. 00864B and money market funds (like SWVXX, VOXX) are safeguards and should not be replaced with high-dividend products like SPHD, as principal safety is paramount.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Rebalancing:</strong> Suitable for those who use leveraged funds, are not retired, and have income.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Real Estate Investment:</strong> Housing prices in the Bay Area are high, putting great pressure on young people to buy houses, which can easily lead to financial difficulties. Renting is recommended to maintain flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing and Investment:</strong> Loans, mortgages, and car loans should be repaid with stable cash flow, not relying on stock market returns.</li>
<li><strong>Retirement Planning:</strong> Retirees should be cautious about borrowing and make plans based on the size of their retirement funds.  If retirement funds are 50 times the annual expenses, two options are available: 1. Keep the mortgage and car loan, using 2% of the retirement fund annually to cover all expenses; 2. Pay off the mortgage and car loan, invest 80% of the remaining funds in 00662, 20% in 00864B, and use 2% of the total funds annually for living expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation Case Study:</strong> A case study with 45 million Taiwan dollars illustrated asset allocation strategies when withdrawals are not needed. An 80/20 allocation or a combination of leveraged funds (60% 00662, 20% 00670L, 20% 00864B) is recommended.  For those with stable income and no need to withdraw from investments, 100% investment in QQQ can be considered.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: Read &ldquo;Investing is Asset Allocation, What You Don&rsquo;t Know,&rdquo; agreeing with the importance of accumulating the first pot of gold early; learning investment allows for more focus on work and personal improvement, spending time each day learning new skills and increasing self-worth.  Investment enables people to be more motivated to improve their professional skills rather than &ldquo;lying flat.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Question 1: What should I do if the Beta value is very low when the asset value plummets in the Excel sheet?

<li>Sharing 1: Agrees with James&rsquo;s philosophy and has increased the investment proportion of QQQ, but some individual stocks have not been completely sold due to tax reasons.</li>
<li>Question 1: Advantages and disadvantages of converting 401K to Roth 401K?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Just put new contributions into Roth 401K; don&rsquo;t convert existing funds. Convert at retirement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2:  How to use HSA and 529 accounts?  Is there any problem with using a credit card to pay medical bills from an HSA?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply:  HSA, 529, and college fund accounts are not recommended because they lead to a loss of control over the funds. Using your own funds or loans is recommended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: Are there any suggestions for increasing income and saving money besides a full-time job?

<li>Sharing 1: Previously followed the advice of online influencers and invested in US stocks and treasury bonds, currently converting to QQQ.  Has a modest salary and one child.</li>
<li>Question 1: Can the 20% cash in the 80/20 allocation be replaced with Fubon 50 2X leverage?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply:  QQQ 2X leverage (00670L) is recommended. He explained the use of leveraged funds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Is it feasible to regularly invest equal amounts in QQQ and 2X leverage?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Feasible, but pay attention to cash reserves. A Beta of 1.1 or 1.2 allocation is recommended, adjusting according to market conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: Can a child&rsquo;s Lunar New Year money be all-in on 2X leverage?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: If you can guarantee continuous regular investment for more than 30 years, it&rsquo;s worth considering, but be aware of the risks and be able to withstand significant asset shrinkage.  In the long run, the returns can be substantial, but psychological barriers must be overcome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 4: Are the views of online influencers recommending treasury bonds correct? Are treasury bonds more valuable during a market crash?

<blockquote>
<p>Rise faster, fall slower.

</blockquote>
<p>This is one of James&rsquo;s core investment philosophies. Through smart rebalancing strategies, increase investment during market rises to accelerate profits, and reduce investment during market downturns to mitigate losses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Money is the least valuable thing when it has no value.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reflects James&rsquo;s unique view on wealth. When wealth accumulates to a certain extent, the value of money itself is no longer important; what matters more is pursuing freedom and happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want freedom, and you want privacy, you will not have freedom. In the future world, if you want privacy, you will not have freedom.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows James&rsquo;s insight into future social trends. In the high-tech era, one needs to make trade-offs between privacy and freedom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more daring one is to borrow money, the broader their perspective.

<p>YJ Yuanlin&rsquo;s sharing led to James&rsquo;s views on borrowing: good debt can help wealth growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want freedom, you cannot care.

</blockquote>
<p>Echoing the topic of Elon Musk supporting Trump and the entrepreneurial spirit, true freedom is not caring about external opinions and focusing on one&rsquo;s goals.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Market is About to Hit New Highs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The market is on the verge of reaching new highs. Entering early is more advantageous than waiting for the new highs to materialize.</li>
<li>Earnings reports from AI and high-tech sectors are projected to surpass expectations. Market funds and corporate profits are also expected to exceed projections.</li>
<li>The market consistently trends upward. Investment requires patience; wealth is worth the wait.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interpreting the Asset Portfolio Research Paper:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long-term bonds carry higher risks than stocks while yielding lower returns. Investment in them is not recommended.</strong></li>
<li><strong>QQQ offers superior returns and risk resistance compared to SPY.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Leveraged funds (e.g., QQQ2D) are characterized by high volatility, substantial downside risk, but also significant upside potential.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Intelligent asset allocation can achieve returns equivalent to a 100% QQQ portfolio while providing greater cash security.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Retirees or individuals without income are advised against using leveraged funds. An 80/20 asset allocation strategy is recommended.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cash is the cornerstone ensuring investors can continue investing.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Additional Investment Advice and Experience Sharing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Retirees should claim their social security benefits as early as possible and utilize them for investments.</li>
<li>Real estate is a liability; selling property for investment purposes is recommended. Avoiding mortgage loans against real estate is advised.</li>
<li>Young individuals can leverage credit loans for investments, accelerating wealth accumulation.</li>
<li>Exercise prudence in investments. Avoid excessive diversification or venturing into unfamiliar domains such as real estate or REITs.</li>
<li><strong>Investing in individual stocks is not advised. Opt for market capitalization-based index funds like QQQ.</strong></li>
<li>Experiencing substantial losses is a prerequisite to appreciating the allure of high returns. The market always presents risks, and one must learn to navigate them.</li>
<li>Short-term safe assets (e.g., treasury bills) are essential components of an investment portfolio, aiding investors in weathering market fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>The higher the proportion of cash or cash-equivalent assets, the greater the risk tolerance of the investment portfolio.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Refrain from self-managing stock portfolios. The returns from most stocks fall short of those from treasury bills.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stock index funds constantly face future risks. Embrace risk tolerance; only by weathering the storms can one see the sunshine.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t put faith in market predictions. During market downturns, &ldquo;stock gurus&rdquo; often emerge, but their predictions are frequently inaccurate.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Adhere to long-term investment principles. Avoid being swayed by short-term market fluctuations.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Marriage and Childbearing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Marriage serves the purpose of creating life to carry on the universe&rsquo;s legacy. Loving one&rsquo;s partner as one would love their own child is paramount to a successful marriage.</li>
<li>Childbearing lies at the heart of life&rsquo;s meaning. Young individuals should marry and have children early, unburdened by financial pressures.</li>
<li>Even without marriage, childbearing should be considered. A life spent single and childless will ultimately lead to profound loneliness.</li>

<p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mentions the Chinese government&rsquo;s strong push for policies akin to MMT (Modern Monetary Theory).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is not included in the Nasdaq 100 index, and the NYSE has extended its trading hours to 22 hours, while Nasdaq hasn&rsquo;t followed suit. Why?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Nasdaq&rsquo;s trading hours are already standard. Extending trading hours only affects after-hours trading, holding little significance for ordinary investors. TSMC&rsquo;s exclusion from the Nasdaq 100 index is linked to factors such as trading costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> How can MMT be explained to someone without financial expertise?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> James uses simple language to elucidate the relationship between government deficits and currency issuance. He asserts that governments can cover deficits by printing money without facing national bankruptcy. Using early American history and ancient barter systems as examples, he illustrates how governments utilize currency issuance to purchase goods and services, and how taxation maintains currency value. James emphasizes the essence of US dollar hegemony, highlighting that the US leverages its control over vital resource trading, like oil, to sustain the dollar&rsquo;s global dominance, citing Russia&rsquo;s forced use of dollars for oil purchases as an example. He also points out that the core nature of fiat currency is a representation of national sovereignty, enabling governments to mandate its use through legal means.</li>

<p><strong>IAM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Questions whether investing in QQQ also implies supporting &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; entities.</li>
<li>After comparing returns from QQQ and its top ten constituent stocks, IAM observed higher returns from the latter, leading to confusion about the role of the remaining 90 companies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Does investing in QQQ equate to supporting &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; entities?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> We, as investors, are contributors. Through our investment in QQQ, we allocate capital to the 100 companies making the most significant contributions to humanity, propelling societal progress.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> The top ten constituent stocks of QQQ generate higher returns; what is the purpose of the other 90 companies?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> The composition of QQQ&rsquo;s top ten holdings changes annually. Examining solely the past decade&rsquo;s data is insufficient. Companies previously ranked lower have the potential to enter the top ten, underscoring the vital role played by the remaining 90 companies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> Are companies ranked lower in QQQ&rsquo;s constituents at risk of being removed due to a decrease in their market capitalization percentage?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Typically not, but QQQ mandates that the percentage of any individual constituent stock cannot exceed a specific threshold. Adjustments are made if this limit is surpassed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 4:</strong> How can one view the complete list of QQQ&rsquo;s constituent companies?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> This information can be accessed on websites like Yahoo Finance, which displays QQQ&rsquo;s holdings, or on QQQ&rsquo;s official website.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chunxia:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shares a friend&rsquo;s investment story. This friend works at Apple and previously held steadfast belief in real estate and cash investments. However, recent issues like property taxes have awakened them to the importance of QQQ. Concerns about Apple stock&rsquo;s risk have led them to hesitate about stock pledges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> This friend holds a large quantity of Apple stock. How can they convert it into QQQ, and how should they approach a stock pledge?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The maximum long-term capital gains tax is 20%, regardless of income. James recommends that this friend sell a portion of their Apple stock sooner rather than later, converting it into QQQ to mitigate individual stock risk and reduce future tax burdens.</li>
<li>A gradual sale of Apple stock is advised, such as selling 10% or 20% each year or only selling the appreciated portion to minimize tax liability.</li>
<li>A stock pledge can be utilized for tax payments, for instance, borrowing 20% for tax obligations while reinvesting the remaining funds to enhance investment efficiency.</li>
<li>James suggests experimenting with a stock pledge, such as borrowing 2% for personal use, to gain firsthand experience with the convenience of borrowing.</li>
<li>He emphasizes the critical role of cash. A higher proportion of cash or cash-equivalent assets translates to greater risk tolerance for the investment portfolio.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Owns multiple properties but has refrained from selling due to tax deductions and rising rental income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Should she sell her properties?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Real estate investments lack the return and liquidity offered by QQQ and potentially face substantial inheritance taxes in the future. Selling the properties is advised. Property taxes, maintenance costs, insurance fees, and more erode the returns from real estate investments. Moreover, real estate is illiquid, requiring time for liquidation. Properties, as inheritance, subject heirs to hefty inheritance taxes, potentially creating an insurmountable financial burden.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> How can she convert to a Roth IRA?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> A Backdoor Roth IRA conversion is an option, involving initially depositing funds into a Traditional IRA and subsequently converting them to a Roth IRA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> Can property tax deductions and rising rental income offset the costs associated with real estate investment?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> The deductible amount for property taxes is limited. Moreover, income from rent increases is subject to income tax and cannot fully offset the costs tied to real estate investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 4:</strong> Concerns about mortgages and trusts.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> If a mortgage is obtained under an individual&rsquo;s name, even placing the property within a trust cannot circumvent inheritance taxes. Using an LLC (Limited Liability Company) for property purchase from the outset is recommended, or transferring the property into an irrevocable trust before death to avoid inheritance tax liabilities.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shares personal and sibling investment experiences. His sister, after experiencing investment losses, is hesitant to redeem her insurance policy. Jenny, due to returns from real estate investment, is reluctant to sell her properties. This illustrates how investors often fall prey to sunk cost and opportunity cost fallacies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How can we enlighten ourselves and those around us to avoid such investment pitfalls?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Understanding the concepts of sunk cost and opportunity cost is essential. Losses from investments should be cut promptly, avoiding attachment to past investments. Seek superior investment opportunities. While Jenny&rsquo;s real estate investment generates cash flow, its return is low, and it may face high inheritance taxes in the future. Therefore, she should consider selling the property and investing in higher-yielding assets like QQQ.</li>

<li>New to financial management, past investments were haphazard, primarily focused on real estate and insurance.</li>
<li>45 years old, with an 18-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son, can invest NT$80,000 monthly. NT$10,000 is allocated to children&rsquo;s savings, with the remaining NT$70,000 for personal investment, aiming for rapid asset accumulation to reach NT$10 million.</li>
<li>Owns a rental property generating NT$30,000-40,000 in net monthly income, with principal invested ranging from NT$2 to 3 million, and the property valued at NT$3 to 4 million.</li>
<li>Children lean towards a &ldquo;non-marriage&rdquo; ideology, expressing no desire for offspring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How should assets be allocated, and how can children be guided towards sound financial management principles?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Suggests referencing the article James provided, titled &ldquo;Individuals Still Some Time Away from Retirement,&rdquo; and adopting a BETA 1.2 asset allocation strategy.</li>
<li>Advises against giving children excessive funds at present. Instead, encourage them to save independently once they have a stable income, guiding them to establish proper financial management habits.</li>
<li>Proposes incentivizing children to marry and have children by offering NT$1 million annually in the future.</li>
<li>Emphasizes that 00864B cannot be replaced by 0056. Cash is cash and should not be substituted with stocks.</li>
<li>Underscores the significance of marriage and childbearing, advising early marriage and parenthood, urging them not to be bound by financial anxieties.</li>

<ul>
<li>Recounts the story of a friend working at Apple. This friend steadfastly believed in real estate and cash as investments but recently recognized the importance of QQQ due to concerns like property taxes. However, they remain apprehensive about the risks associated with Apple stock and hesitate to engage in stock pledges.</li>
<li>This friend maintains a high spending level but undoubtedly possesses the financial capacity for retirement. They simply derive great enjoyment from work.</li>
<li>The friend has already contacted Lisa and is preparing for a stock pledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  This friend holds a substantial amount of Apple stock. How can they convert it into QQQ, and how should they approach a stock pledge?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The maximum long-term capital gains tax is 20%, independent of income. James recommends selling a portion of their Apple stock as soon as possible, converting it to QQQ to mitigate individual stock risk and reduce future tax burdens.</li>
<li>A gradual sale of Apple stock is advised, such as 10% or 20% each year, or selling only the appreciated portion to minimize tax liability.</li>
<li>Utilizing a stock pledge for tax payments is suggested, such as borrowing 20% for tax obligations while reinvesting the remaining funds to enhance investment efficiency.</li>
<li>James encourages them to experiment with a stock pledge, perhaps borrowing 2% for personal use, to experience the convenience of borrowing firsthand.</li>
<li>He highlights the vital role of cash. A higher proportion of cash or cash-equivalent assets translates to greater risk tolerance for the investment portfolio.</li>
<li>James advises this friend to learn from investment approaches employed by individuals like Warren Buffett and Wei Ying-ch’ung, leveraging credit for investment purposes.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How should labor pension funds be withdrawn?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> If proficient in investment, withdrawing the entire labor pension fund at once and investing it in high-yielding assets like QQQ is recommended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wu Liyun:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Is NT$5 million in stocks and cash sufficient for retirement?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>  NT$5 million in assets is insufficient to support a comfortable retirement. Withdrawing a labor pension monthly to supplement retirement income is recommended.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Young individuals should be bold in using borrowed funds for investment to accelerate wealth accumulation.</strong>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Young people are in their prime earning years, with steadily increasing income. They can utilize tools like credit loans to access low-cost capital for investing in high-return assets like QQQ, thereby speeding up their wealth-building journey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cash is the cornerstone ensuring investors can continue investing.</strong>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Market volatility is a constant. Maintaining sufficient cash or cash-equivalent assets helps investors navigate market fluctuations with ease, preventing panic-driven asset sales, ultimately achieving long-term investment objectives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise prudence in investments. Avoid excessive diversification or venturing into unfamiliar domains.</strong>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Focus investments within familiar areas. Refrain from blindly pursuing diversification or investing in unfamiliar domains, such as real estate or REITs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The essence of US dollar hegemony lies in the US leveraging its control over vital resource trading, like oil, to sustain the dollar&rsquo;s global dominance.</strong>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By mandating US dollar settlements for global oil transactions, the US compels other nations to hold dollar reserves, solidifying its global currency dominance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Marriage serves the purpose of creating life to carry on the universe&rsquo;s legacy. Loving one&rsquo;s partner as one would love their own child is paramount to a successful marriage.</strong>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The significance of marriage lies in procreation and the continuation of life. Loving one&rsquo;s partner deeply, treating them as one would treat their own child, is crucial for a lasting and fulfilling marriage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Childbearing lies at the heart of life&rsquo;s meaning. Young individuals should marry and have children early, unburdened by financial pressures.</strong>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Childbearing is inherent to human nature and the perpetuation of life. Young people should courageously embrace the responsibility of parenthood, refusing to be deterred by financial concerns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Investors often fall prey to sunk cost and opportunity cost fallacies.</strong>
&ndash; Professor Zhou</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sunk costs refer to incurred expenses that are irretrievable, such as purchased stocks or real estate. Opportunity cost represents the potential gains foregone by choosing one investment over other available options. During decision-making, investors should not be swayed by sunk costs; instead, they should prioritize opportunity cost, selecting investments offering higher returns.</p>
