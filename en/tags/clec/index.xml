<p>The core theme of this session is to <strong>break free from a labor mindset and establish a rich mindset</strong>. Traditional wisdom suggests that one needs to work hard, save money, and invest to get rich, while the core of a rich mindset is understanding how to utilize financial leverage. Teacher James illustrates with specific examples how a small principal (e.g., $30,000) can be used to spend far more than the principal (e.g., $1,000,000) through long-term low-interest borrowing (such as stock-backed loans), while the principal itself compounds in the market over the long term, with its future value sufficient to cover all debts. This financial operation of &ldquo;borrowing to spend, never selling assets&rdquo; is where the real big money is, far superior to the &ldquo;peanuts&rdquo; earned from stock picking and short-term trading.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on one, eliminate distractions</strong>: The only investment target is the Nasdaq 100 index fund (e.g., QQQ). Ignore market fluctuations, financial news, analyst opinions, financial reports, and any other recommended ETFs (such as VT, SPY, VTI, and various 0098x and other &ldquo;demonic&rdquo; codes in Taiwan). The teacher guarantees with 40+ years of investment experience that if there were a better target, he would have recommended it long ago.</li>
<li><strong>Trust in predecessors&rsquo; experience, avoid self-trial and error</strong>: Beginners should first accept the warning &ldquo;don&rsquo;t touch fire,&rdquo; meaning don&rsquo;t touch investment targets not recommended by the teacher. Asking questions won&rsquo;t teach you anything; you should calmly watch hundreds of videos first, and then the questions you have will be genuine. Learning from the wisdom and experience of predecessors (e.g., reading classics like &ldquo;Tao Te Ching,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Bible&rdquo;) can help avoid detours, which is the cheapest way to learn in life.</li>
<li><strong>Be highly vigilant of the financial system</strong>: You&rsquo;re alert when you receive a scam call, but you completely trust what financial advisors and insurance agents tell you, and that&rsquo;s the scariest scam. View the <strong>financial industry, insurance industry, and government</strong> as a united potential &ldquo;scam group,&rdquo; and be vigilant about any products they recommend.</li>
<li><strong>Advice for newcomers</strong>: New friends can start by watching video <strong>00451</strong> on our YouTube channel to build a basic understanding.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Consolidation</strong>: All funds and individual stocks should be converted into an asset allocation based on QQQ.</li>
<li><strong>Account Configuration Recommendations for US Investors</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Leveraged Funds (QLD, TQQQ)</strong>: Should be 99.99% placed in tax-advantaged retirement accounts (e.g., Roth IRA).</li>
<li><strong>Cash</strong>: Can be placed in any account, but for different purposes.
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash in Roth accounts</strong>: Used for &ldquo;smart rebalancing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Cash in Stock-Backed Loan Accounts (Pledge Account)</strong>: Used to reduce account volatility and prevent margin calls.</li>
<li><strong>Cash in Taxable Accounts or Traditional IRA</strong>: Used to slow down the appreciation rate of that account, which helps with tax planning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Warning for Non-US Residents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not open accounts with US brokers</strong>: Non-US tax residents will face up to 40% estate tax on assets in the US, and accounts may be frozen at any time. The process for descendants to handle inheritance is extremely cumbersome and complex, and lawyer fees may deplete most of the assets.</li>
<li><strong>Keep money close</strong>: Assets should remain in your country of residence. If you live in Taiwan, keep your money in Taiwan; if you live in Hong Kong, keep your money in Hong Kong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Financial Education</strong>: Educating children about finance is more important than academic performance. Children can have poor grades, they can be lazy, but they cannot be ignorant of financial management. In a capitalist society, knowing how to grow assets is more crucial than having a high degree but being a &ldquo;pauper.&rdquo; Cultivate independent thinking and judgment.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Misconceptions of traditional labor mindset</strong>: Believing that one must work hard, save diligently, and invest diligently to have money to spend. This is a passive and inefficient mindset that prevents an easy life.</li>
<li><strong>Core of Rich Mindset â€“ Financial Operations</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>The Art of Borrowing</strong>: The core of borrowing is not to consider the interest rate first, but that the <strong>loan term should be as long as possible</strong>. If a loan can be repaid principal and interest in 40 years, even if the interest rate is as high as 8%, it&rsquo;s worth borrowing because inflation and asset appreciation will far exceed the interest cost.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging Small Capital for Large Assets</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: You currently have $30,000. At an annualized return of 15%, it will grow to nearly $7,000,000 in 40 years. Based on this enormous future asset, you now have the ability to borrow $1,000,000 to spend, as long as this loan is long-term, or even never requires principal repayment (like a stock-backed loan). Your asset growth rate will exceed your debt growth rate.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Don&rsquo;t spend your $30,000; let it snowball. The money you spend is borrowed. This is the essence of financial operations, which involves tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stop Focusing on Small Money</strong>: Don&rsquo;t dwell on stock picking, short-term trading, and other behaviors aimed at earning price differences. These are insignificant like sesame seeds compared to the grand scope of financial operations.</li>

<li>Question 1: Regarding workplace salary, I asked my boss for a $20,000 raise and a $50,000 bonus. My boss agreed to the raise but refused the bonus, which I accepted. I felt that the long-term nature of salary was more important than a one-time bonus. I&rsquo;d like to ask for Teacher James&rsquo;s opinion.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your decision was absolutely correct. Supervisors are usually willing to give raises because the money belongs to the company, not them personally. A fixed salary increase is permanent, while a bonus is one-time and can be canceled by the company at any time. This aligns with our philosophy of long-term investing, which seeks stable and continuous growth (15% annually) rather than short-term spikes (a single day&rsquo;s surge). You&rsquo;ve grasped the key point.</li>

<li>Share 1: I only discovered the teacher&rsquo;s channel in late August and felt like I&rsquo;d struck gold. Within a week, I invested all my funds into the market and plan to invest the money from cashing out my endowment insurance.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Excellent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Share 2: I shared the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy with a beauty industry group I founded, hoping my peers could also benefit, as many in our industry receive advance payments from clients, which serves as excellent interest-free cash flow for investment. However, some people left the group as soon as they heard about investing, which made me feel frustrated and regretful.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: This is a very typical reaction. Topics like investing and politics should not be shared casually in non-homogeneous groups. Every group has its inherent attributes, and abruptly introducing unrelated topics, like discussing politics in a group, will inevitably cause a &ldquo;commotion.&rdquo; You must anticipate such a reaction. Also, a reminder: for advance payments received by businesses, you need to reserve sufficient working capital for operations and not over-invest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 1: A client of mine, almost 50 years old, thinks this investment method is too slow and that one doesn&rsquo;t have many 40-year periods in life. I&rsquo;d like to hear the teacher&rsquo;s insights. Also, should the funds from my surrendered endowment insurance all be invested in 00865B (Taiwanese short-term government bond ETF) as cash, or do I need to keep some in a savings account at the bank?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Regarding your client&rsquo;s question, this is a difference in mindset. For fund allocation, cash does not need to be kept in the bank. 00865B has excellent liquidity; if you sell today, the money arrives the day after tomorrow, so it can be used entirely as cash. For daily expenses, try to use credit cards, and then sell 00865B once to repay the bill. Your subsequent income can be vaguely and randomly invested into 00662, 00670L, and 00865B, no need to be overly precise, for example, rotating among the three every four months.</li>

<li>Question 1: I&rsquo;m 53. Due to government housing policies, I&rsquo;m considering selling my self-occupied home in Taoyuan at a low price and renting instead, which would give me about 5 million in cash. Should I use this money to pay off my car loan and personal loan first, and then invest the remaining money using a 70/30 or 60/13/30 strategy? Also, I pay a lot for insurance every month, and some policies are nearing their maturity. What should I do?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You can sell the house and invest the money. But <strong>absolutely do not use the money from selling the house to pay off any loans</strong>. Borrowed money is &ldquo;someone else&rsquo;s chicken&rdquo;; let it lay eggs. Your own money is &ldquo;your own chicken&rdquo;; let it lay eggs too. Use your future salary from re-entering the workforce to make monthly installment payments. For insurance, <strong>immediately, right now, surrender all of it</strong>; take back whatever you can. As long as you stop paying, you win, and you&rsquo;ll have tens of millions more in the future.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Regarding the order of placing leveraged funds in accounts, why would Traditional IRA/401k be prioritized over a Brokerage Account? This seems to contradict the idea of &ldquo;putting cash in a Traditional account to slow appreciation.&rdquo; Moreover, future withdrawals from Traditional accounts are taxed at Income Tax rates, which are higher than Brokerage&rsquo;s Capital Gain Tax rates.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This question is more complex. The core reasons are: 1) Leveraged funds cannot be used for stock-backed loans. Placing leveraged funds in a Brokerage account would &ldquo;pollute&rdquo; this account, which might be used for pledging in the future. 2) Leveraged funds have high volatility and will inevitably require rebalancing, which would incur taxes if done in a Brokerage account. Although the future tax rate in a Traditional account is higher, it provides a &ldquo;tax deferral&rdquo; effect, allowing you to operate freely internally without tax worries. More importantly, you don&rsquo;t need to allocate leverage in every account. <strong>The core is to maintain the overall investment portfolio&rsquo;s Beta value at 1.0.</strong> You can achieve Beta 1.0 through leveraged funds in Roth accounts and cash or QQQ in Traditional/Brokerage accounts. This results in the same return but with a superior tax structure and risk control.</li>

<li>Share 1: After listening to the teacher&rsquo;s class, I decided to cancel a life insurance policy I had paid for 7 years, at CAD 20,000 per year. Although I lost CAD 100,000, I felt relieved. My husband also agreed because I calculated for him that even if we only got back a portion of this money, its value in 40 years would far exceed the CAD 1,000,000 insured amount. I don&rsquo;t regret my past decisions because they were made with the knowledge I had at the time, but now my understanding has upgraded.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Excellent sharing and decision. Having tens of millions in assets while alive is far more meaningful than receiving a million in insurance after death.</li>

<li>Question 1: I&rsquo;m 50 and plan to sell an investment property, expecting CAD 900,000 in cash. How should I allocate this large sum into my planned configuration of 40% QQQ, 15% QLD, 10% TQQQ, and 35% cash?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: For someone nearing retirement, safety is paramount. First, calculate how many years of living expenses you&rsquo;ll need after retirement and prepare <strong>at least 10-15 years of cash</strong>. For example, if you spend 60,000 a year, you&rsquo;ll need 600,000 in cash for 10 years. Set this money aside first, and then allocate the remaining funds according to your asset allocation ratio.</li>

<li>Share 1: My short-term trading for the past 10 years ultimately amounted to nothing, but in the past two years, I switched to long-term QQQ investing, yielding substantial returns.</li>
<li>Question 1: I leveraged an additional NT$15 million from real estate in Taiwan, with an interest rate of 2.88%, renewed annually, with no principal repayment required. Is it feasible to invest this money and then use a portion of the investment profits to pay the interest, continuing this operation? Also, I am currently in the US, with most of my assets in Taiwan. Is this long-term plan suitable?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Short-term operations are feasible. But in the long run, if you and your children will eventually settle in the US, assets should ultimately be transferred to the US. This is primarily to simplify estate planning and avoid Taiwan&rsquo;s relatively high estate tax on large cash assets. The US estate tax exemption is much higher than Taiwan&rsquo;s. You need to be aware of the potential risks and penalties of not declaring overseas assets to the IRS and plan accordingly.</li>

This is an unnecessary complication that will only bring endless trouble, such as accounting, tax filing, company maintenance, etc. For long-term investors who don&rsquo;t sell, a personal Brokerage account is already very tax-optimized, so there&rsquo;s no need to complicate things for a little extra Roth space.

<li>Question 1: In the teacher&rsquo;s simulation, the final asset multiple of the 433 configuration without pledging (5.8x) was higher than that with pledging (4.somethingx). So why should we still choose stock-backed loans?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The simulation results depend on the historical market path. Our simulated period (starting from the 2000 high) was a &ldquo;volatile market&rdquo; with a sharp ten-year decline followed by a slow recovery. In such a market, &ldquo;mindless rebalancing&rdquo; (without pledging) performs better because it dares to buy heavily during downturns. However, in a long-term bull market (e.g., 1980-2000), &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; (with pledging) would outperform. The most important reason we choose pledging is not to pursue the highest return, but to <strong>ensure survival in extreme markets and avoid liquidation.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: When actually taking out a stock-backed loan, where does the monthly interest come from? Is it reserved from the $200,000 borrowed?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: No. The interest should also be borrowed. Your total loan limit is very high (e.g., $6 million on $10 million in assets), and you only borrowed $200,000. The monthly interest, a few hundred dollars, can be directly borrowed from your available credit limit. This way, your debt will increase slowly, but your assets will grow at a faster rate.</li>

<li>Question 1: Regarding car loan interest at 8%, life insurance, and the Canadian ETF HXS.TO.

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Car loan interest at 8% is too expensive. Don&rsquo;t take out a loan at a car dealership; consider buying a Tesla, their interest rates are much lower. Life insurance is for dead people; living people don&rsquo;t need it, it&rsquo;s meaningless. Canadian investors can buy HXS.TO.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>You currently have 300 dollars, you should be able to spend 10,000 dollars.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight concisely explains the power of financial leverage. Your purchasing power should not be determined by your current cash, but by the potential future value of your assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hard work has no future&hellip; Making money work hard is what truly matters.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight overturns traditional values, emphasizing the importance of passive income and asset appreciation. The core is to make capital work for you, not the other way around.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re even vigilant when you receive a scam call, but you completely trust what your financial advisor tells you, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s truly terrifying.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight uses a strong contrast to warn investors that they must maintain independent judgment and critical thinking towards all financial institutions&rsquo; advice, not blindly trusting them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The financial industry, the insurance industry, and the government, combined, are a scam group.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight, in an extreme way, reminds investors to be highly wary of complex products recommended by all financial institutions, as their goal is usually to earn your fees and commissions, not to serve your best interests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Beta is the same, the volatility is the same, the return rate is the same.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight is the scientific core of asset allocation. The return of an investment portfolio is determined by its overall market risk exposure (Beta), not by how many &ldquo;magical&rdquo; leveraged products it contains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I actually didn&rsquo;t feel much pain, discomfort, or regret&hellip; because that was the decision I made based on my understanding at the time, but now I&rsquo;m different.
&ndash; Jenny</p></blockquote>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s reflection when sharing her decision to surrender a loss-making insurance policy embodies the process of an investor&rsquo;s mental maturation: not being trapped by past sunk costs, but bravely making the right decision based on a higher level of understanding now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not a truth you&rsquo;ve realized yourself, there&rsquo;s no extra profit in it for you, because it belongs to others.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasizes the importance of independent thinking and truly understanding investment philosophy. Following the crowd or using strategies one doesn&rsquo;t understand, even if profitable in the short term, cannot be sustained in the long run because it doesn&rsquo;t fall within one&rsquo;s own circle of competence.</p>

<p>This gathering was a profound course in reshaping financial intelligence. Teacher James fundamentally challenged the traditional notion of &ldquo;work hard, save money to get rich,&rdquo; clearly advocating a rich mindset centered on &ldquo;financial operations.&rdquo; Through the strategy of &ldquo;borrowing to consume, never selling assets,&rdquo; investors can break free from dependence on active income, allowing assets to calmly compound in the market over the long term. The Q&amp;A session served as a rich case study, applying this core concept to diverse real-world scenarios such as salary negotiations, insurance decisions, large-sum asset deployment, and cross-border asset management, providing listeners with extremely valuable practical guidance and mindset building. The entire sharing was not just about &ldquo;technique&rdquo; (how to invest), but more about &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; (how to think about wealth).</p>

<p>This session&rsquo;s theme revolves around &ldquo;The market always goes up, live for yourself.&rdquo; The core idea is that the essence of investing is very simple: believe in the market&rsquo;s long-term upward trend and hold on. The real challenge is psychological. Therefore, we should not be disturbed by short-term market fluctuations, financial news, world events, or other external information. Instead, we should shift our focus back to life itselfâ€”concentrating on health, happiness, family, and personal values, viewing money as a tool to achieve freedom and abundance in life, not as the ultimate goal.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth and Happiness</strong>: Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right, and health is the foundation. Money is just a tool to achieve a free, abundant, and happy life; investing itself is not the purpose of life.</li>
<li><strong>Children&rsquo;s Education</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Focus on cultivating the right values in children (not stealing, robbing, breaking the law, or taking drugs) and appreciating their talents, rather than just focusing on academic performance.</li>
<li>Parents should not impose their own expectations or unfulfilled dreams on their children, such as forcing them to study abroad. This puts immense pressure on the children.</li>
<li>A true home is where the parents are. Children should be encouraged to pursue their own ideals, not to satisfy their parents&rsquo; expectations.</li>
<li>Compared to buying a house for a child, it&rsquo;s better to have and raise the child first, because wealth can be created, but childbirth has a time window.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Live in the Present, Focus on Yourself</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In life, focus on your own goals. Don&rsquo;t get sidetracked by trivial matters (like fussing over exchange rates or searching for better investments), as this will only delay the process of achieving financial freedom.</li>
<li>Teacher James uses his own management experience as an example: At the company, he focused on only the three most important tasks each day. Once completed, he could go home. This approach is efficient and goal-oriented. Conversely, trying to do everything results in being busy all day with nothing accomplished.</li>
<li>Live your own life, not one led by the media and online information. Cutting off useless external information will not result in any loss.</li>
<li>True living is about &ldquo;presence&rdquo;â€”living in the moment. Whether eating, gardening, or traveling, you should be fully engaged and feel the beauty of life itself. External distractions, like what Trump said, have no bearing on our lives or investments.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do the Right Thing and Persist</strong>: The secret to successful investing is to &ldquo;do the right thing and stick with it for the long term.&rdquo; For example, invest whenever you have money, regardless of the exchange rate, without timing the market. Once you have identified the right path (like investing in QQQ), you should forge ahead without looking back.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Mortgage</strong>:
<ul>
<li>This is an excellent tool for &ldquo;activating assets&rdquo; and is not just for people short on cash.</li>
<li>It provides a steady cash flow, as if the house is working for you. This money can be used for investment, thus increasing your assets while retaining the property.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a great option for parents with insufficient retirement funds, allowing them to live better lives without their children needing to provide financial support.</li>
<li>For elderly individuals with weak financial management skills and only one house left, a reverse mortgage is more stable than selling the house to invest, avoiding the risk of losing their last home.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Borrowing to Invest</strong>:
<ul>
<li>An example: If you use your own $30,000 to buy a car, the potential value of that money in 50 years (about $32 million) is lost. But if you take a pledged loan of $30,000 to buy the car and invest your own $30,000, in 50 years you will have $32 million in assets, while the debt is only $340,000.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Make good use of financial leverage. Borrow for consumption or investment, and let your own money continue to grow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example of Leveraged Asset Allocation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Teacher James shares his asset allocation model: 40% QQQ (1x), 15% QLD (2x), 10% TQQQ (3x), and 35% cash.</li>
<li>The Beta value of this portfolio is calculated as: (40% * 1) + (15% * 2) + (10% * 3) = 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.3 = 1.0.</li>
<li>This allocation, while having an overall risk comparable to holding 100% QQQ (Beta=1.0), retains a large amount of cash (35%) for risk control and rebalancing during market downturns.</li>
<li><strong>Key Point</strong>: Any asset allocation that includes leveraged funds <strong>must</strong> implement a smart rebalancing strategy.</li>
</ul>

<li>Sharing: After renting out a house he owns, he recently took it back for his own use and found being a landlord very troublesome. He had to deal with various damages and cleaning for walls, doors, and windows, and deeply realized that the actual return on real estate investment is not as high as it seems.</li>
<li>Question 1: Since the house was bought by his family, he can&rsquo;t sell it freely. He&rsquo;s thinking of taking out a mortgage-like loan on the house (interest-only payments) and investing the cash into 00662. Is this idea feasible?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Absolutely correct, you should do it immediately. Borrow any money you can as soon as possible. The power of borrowing to invest is immense. He demonstrated the huge opportunity cost difference by calculating the 50-year outcomes of buying a car with $30,000 versus borrowing $1 million.</li>

<li>Question: She is in her fifties/sixties and wants to take out a pledged loan in China on her fully paid-off house, but banks only offer a maximum term of 3-5 years, which is too risky. How does the teacher obtain long-term loans?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The best long-term loan is a &ldquo;stock-pledged loan,&rdquo; which can be structured to never pay back the principal, and even the interest can be rolled into the principal. Mortgages and personal loans have fixed terms and are not suitable. For short-term loans (like 3-5 years), don&rsquo;t borrow unless you are confident you can repay even if the market crashes. He suggests she sell her house in China, even at a lower price, as long as she can liquidate it. Abroad, she can try using Interactive Brokers (IB) for stock-pledged loans.</li>

<li>Sharing: Inspired by the teacher, he successfully borrowed a large sum of money from the bank against his assets and discovered that car loans don&rsquo;t count towards his debt ratio. He plans to use a 2% pledged loan to pay off the car loan, thereby investing more funds into the 433 allocation. He now feels that the speed of his asset growth has surpassed his annual salary.</li>
<li>Question: He saw a YouTuber say that Chinese engineers in Silicon Valley are unhappy due to endless &ldquo;comparisons&rdquo; (of degrees, companies, salaries, houses, wives, children). As someone with a master&rsquo;s degree, he also felt insecure in an environment full of PhDs. How does the teacher view &ldquo;comparison&rdquo;? And how can the teacher confidently pay his subordinates a higher salary than his own?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Quoting Munger, &ldquo;Envy is a really stupid sin.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t compare; the key is a strong inner self. You must affirm from within that you are the best. The way you see yourself is more important than how others see you. He uses his own experience of leading a team of PhDs without a PhD himself, and designing Microsoft&rsquo;s Media architecture and the computer Hibernate patent, to illustrate that success is unrelated to academic degrees but is related to confidence and intellect.</li>

<li>Question 1: She is 60 and retired. As recommended, she has allocated TQQQ in her smaller Roth IRA account. However, the AI on Chen Feng&rsquo;s website advises her not to use leverage at her age and to keep many years of cash. How much cash should a retiree actually keep? Is it 30% or 15 years&rsquo; worth of living expenses?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t fully trust the AI; follow the teacher&rsquo;s instruction. Her allocation (TQQQ in Roth, cash in Traditional IRA) is correct. Retirees should keep <strong>30% cash</strong>, which is approximately equivalent to <strong>15 years&rsquo; worth</strong> of living expenses. This is not due to pessimism about the market; on the contrary, the market may rise even faster in the future. This is the result of the CLEC investment system&rsquo;s &ldquo;DNA evolution&rdquo; after being tested by the market, making it better able to withstand future extreme risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: She saw other financial bloggers advocating for market timing using &ldquo;economic indicator signals&rdquo; and is worried that buying TQQQ at a market high will lead to significant decay.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t refer to other people&rsquo;s investment systems; they won&rsquo;t be compatible. Within the 433 asset allocation, there is no so-called &ldquo;decay&rdquo; problem for TQQQ because the large cash reserve acts as a buffer, and the actual drop of the portfolio during a downturn will be less than that of 100% QQQ.</li>

<li>Question 1: She is 43 and just immigrated to the US. Her 401k and IRA accounts have very little money. To implement the 433 allocation, it seems she can only buy leveraged ETFs in a taxable brokerage account. Is this acceptable?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes. In the early stages when funds are insufficient, you can use a 433 allocation in a brokerage account to maintain a higher Beta and sufficient cash. Although rebalancing will generate taxes, the priority is to &ldquo;make money first.&rdquo; However, you must <strong>do smart rebalancing every year</strong>, because a 30% leveraged position is very risky and cannot be left unattended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: For dollar-cost averaging for an 11-year-old child, the teacher previously recommended QLD. Why not the better TQQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: TQQQ has extremely high volatility. Calculating from the 2000 peak, it might take over 20 years to break even, whereas QLD breaks even faster. For a child&rsquo;s long-term investment of over 20 years, both are acceptable, but the premise is that you <strong>must persist in buying continuously</strong>, regardless of market ups and downs. If the investment horizon is uncertain or you want to be more conservative, QLD is the safer choice.</li>

<li>Question: Should high-net-worth families be concerned about the 40% US estate tax? Should they set up an irrevocable trust in advance to avoid it?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: First, the US estate tax exemption has been permanently set at $15 million per person, meaning a couple has a $30 million exemption. Most families don&rsquo;t need to worry. Second, he does not recommend setting up an irrevocable charitable trust because they usually require an annual donation of 5% of assets, which is a huge burden and constraint on the children. A better way is to use the annual gift tax exclusion (e.g., $20,000) and start gifting early. Over the long term, the growth of the gifted assets will far exceed the estate tax exemption amount.</li>

<li>Question: She (in Canada) obtained extra cash for investment through a home refinance. Can the interest on this portion of the loan be deducted as an investment expense for tax purposes?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Only when you sell an asset and generate a realized capital gain do you have taxable investment income against which related expenses might be deducted. If you just hold and don&rsquo;t sell, there is no taxable event. Canada&rsquo;s Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is similar to the US Roth IRA, and investment and rebalancing operations should be conducted within it.</li>

<li>Question (from the comment section): With 30 million TWD in assets, if I withdraw 2% for living expenses, 600,000 per year is not enough. Do I have to wait until my assets double to 60 million to live a good life?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Not necessarily. You can increase the withdrawal rate by adjusting your asset allocation. For example, you can change the 433 allocation (Beta=1) to a 424 or 514 allocation with a higher cash percentage, which lowers the portfolio&rsquo;s volatility (Beta&lt;1). Once the volatility is reduced, the annual withdrawal rate can be safely increased to 3% or 3.5%.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right, and health is the foundation of life.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: At the beginning of the class, the teacher explained the relationship between investment and life, emphasizing that our ultimate goals are happiness and health, while wealth is an innate right and a tool to achieve those goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you living your own life, or a life defined by the external environment? Don&rsquo;t be led by outside information.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: The teacher advised students not to be engrossed in media and online information all day, as that is living a life defined by others, not their own. One should return to their inner self and focus on their own life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Envy is a really stupid sin.
&ndash; Teacher James (quoting Charlie Munger)</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When answering a student&rsquo;s question about &ldquo;comparison,&rdquo; the teacher quoted Munger&rsquo;s famous line, pointing out that comparing oneself to others is a source of unhappiness and a foolish act.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are what you think you are, and that is more important than how others see you. If you don&rsquo;t even believe in what you are, how can others believe in what you are?
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: The teacher encouraged students to build self-confidence. He believes that personal value is determined by self-perception, not by external evaluations or labels like academic degrees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When borrowing money, we don&rsquo;t fear high interest rates; we fear that the term is too short.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When answering a question about loans, the teacher stressed the importance of the loan term. As long as the term is long enough, even with a higher interest rate, the long-term growth of assets is sufficient to cover the costs, whereas short-term loans carry immense risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be clear about what you want. For everything else that is different from what you want, you don&rsquo;t need to care, you don&rsquo;t need to mind, and you don&rsquo;t need to compare.
&ndash; Chen Feng</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Student Chen Feng shared this perspective when explaining how he avoids the &ldquo;comparison&rdquo; mindset. He believes that as long as you are clear about your own goals, you will not be disturbed by external factors unrelated to them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you keep following our DNA, your DNA will evolve. This is how you can prepare for potential future risks and changes.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When explaining why he now recommends holding more cash (30%), the teacher compared the CLEC investment system to a biological DNA. This system continuously evolves after being tested by the market, becoming better adapted to various future environments. Therefore, students need to keep learning to acquire this &ldquo;evolved&rdquo; and robust system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are 100% in leveraged funds, you might go to hell; it would be like a dream that ends in 30 years.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When reminding students of the risks of leveraged funds, the teacher seriously pointed out that being fully invested in leveraged funds without asset allocation and rebalancing could ultimately lead to a total loss in a major market crash.</p>

<p>This session once again emphasized the core of the CLEC investment philosophy: investing is simple, mindset is supreme. Starting from a high-level life philosophy, Teacher James guided everyone to shift their focus from the complex noise of the market to the simple purity of their personal lives, fostering the belief to &ldquo;live for yourself.&rdquo; The course not only shared profound insights on children&rsquo;s education and self-worth realization but also delved into the practical application of financial tools like &ldquo;reverse mortgages&rdquo; and &ldquo;pledged loans.&rdquo; It also provided detailed explanations on the risk control and long-term operational principles of asset allocation (especially the 433 strategy involving leveraged funds). Through active questions and sharing from students, many practical confusionsâ€”such as allocation in different accounts, tax issues, and retirement cash flow planningâ€”were clearly answered. Ultimately, the course returned to a fundamental point: build a strong inner self and adhere to the right principles, and wealth will naturally follow.</p>

<li><strong>Core Philosophy</strong>: The market has no ceiling; it will only go higher. The simplest and most effective investment method is to &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, and never sell.&rdquo; The only thing investors need to do is buy; they don&rsquo;t even need to consider selling. This simple truth is often not understood by the public, while the media prefers sensational and &ldquo;bloodthirsty&rdquo; headlines to attract attention.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Cannot Be Taught, Only Learned</strong>: The teacher stresses that even if the audience listens to what he says, they may not truly learn it. True mastery comes from investors spending their own time watching videos, thinking independently, and studying.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>For the Young or Those with Insufficient Funds</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: When your total capital is not enough to cover <strong>three years</strong> of annual expenses, complex asset allocation is not recommended.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: First, save up <strong>one year</strong> of emergency funds (in cash or a money market fund). Any amount exceeding the emergency fund should be fully invested in QQQ or 00662.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If your annual expense is 100,000 and your total assets are 160,000, then 100,000 should be kept as an emergency fund, and only 60,000 can be invested.</li>
<li><strong>Turning Point</strong>: When the cash portion can reach about 30% of your total assets, and this amount already exceeds one year&rsquo;s expenses, you can start considering a more systematic asset allocation. For example, with total assets of 500,000 and annual expenses of 100,000, 30% cash is 150,000, which is higher than the 100,000 emergency fund requirement. At this point, you can start asset allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation and Pledging Strategy for High-Net-Worth Individuals (433 Model)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Case Study</strong>: A 35-year-old friend with 60 million in assets uses a 433 asset allocation (40% QQQ, 30% QLD, 30% short-term bonds/cash).</li>
<li><strong>2% Living Expense Rule</strong>: Borrow 2% of <strong>total assets</strong> annually for living expenses through stock pledging. In this case, it&rsquo;s 2% of 60 million, which is 1.2 million per year. <strong>The key is that it&rsquo;s based on total assets, not 2% of a single holding (like QQQ)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Long-Term Growth</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In the 10th year: Total assets are expected to grow from 60 million to about 200 million, while total debt (including interest) will be around 14 million, resulting in a very healthy debt ratio of only 7%.</li>
<li>At that point, the living expense standard can be raised, for example, to live on 1% (2 million/year) or 2% (4 million/year) of 200 million.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rebalancing and Taxes</strong>: After significant asset growth, you can re-allocate your assets. For U.S. investors, rebalancing within a ROTH account can effectively avoid capital gains tax, which is highly efficient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Health First: Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Importance</strong>: The teacher strongly recommends that everyone, especially friends over 40, pay for an LDCT lung cancer screening.</li>
<li><strong>Judgment Criteria</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If a nodule smaller than 0.6cm is found, there is no need to worry excessively; annual follow-ups are sufficient.</li>
<li>If a nodule larger than 0.8cm is found, you must immediately consult a thoracic specialist. The doctor will arrange for follow-up tracking (usually covered by health insurance). If the nodule shows signs of growth during the observation period, it needs to be dealt with promptly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Core Idea</strong>: Early detection and early treatment are key. Do not neglect screening out of fear of &ldquo;false positives.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Question 1: My son lives in Taiwan, but his US dollar income is directly deposited into a Hong Kong account. Should he bring the money back to Taiwan to buy 00662, or open an account in Hong Kong to buy QQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The core principle is &ldquo;<strong>If you are in Taiwan, your money should be in Taiwan</strong>.&rdquo; Funds should not be kept in Hong Kong. Remit the money back to Taiwan and declare it as income for tax purposes normally. Don&rsquo;t worry about exchange rate fluctuations; in the long run, the average exchange rate from remitting in batches will tend towards an expected value. The exchange rate is irrelevant to long-term investment. If you have money, you should buy immediately and not let the exchange rate influence your decision.</li>

<li>Question 2: Regarding the 60 million asset case, living off a 2% pledge (1.2 million) annually, if I only need 1% (600,000), should I only withdraw 1%, or withdraw 2% and invest the extra 1% back?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Just withdraw the 1% you need. You can choose not to use the extra credit line, or you can borrow it to reinvest, which will make you grow faster. Both are acceptable.</li>

<li>Question 1: She is 63 this year and has already converted part of her Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Her company&rsquo;s 401k also allows Roth contributions. Should she, from now on, choose Roth for everything she can convert and contribute to?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes, that is very correct and urgent. First, all future contributions should go into a Roth 401k. Second, she has 1.7M in a Traditional IRA and must speed up the conversion. Otherwise, she will face a huge tax burden at age 75 due to RMD (Required Minimum Distribution). Based on calculations, she needs to convert about 270,000 per year to finish before age 75. It&rsquo;s easier to convert now while she has work income than after retirement when she has no cash flow. Consider borrowing from a pledged account to pay the conversion tax.</li>

<li>Question 1: Is it necessary for high-net-worth individuals to do stock pledging?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Not necessarily, but this is precisely the difference between being &ldquo;<strong>rich</strong>&rdquo; and being &ldquo;<strong>super-rich</strong>.&rdquo; He used a striking example: with 60 million in assets, if you use pledged loans for living expenses (allowing the principal to compound at 15%), your net worth could reach <strong>15.8 billion</strong> after 40 years. However, if you don&rsquo;t pledge and instead sell assets for living expenses each year (causing the total return rate to drop to 13%), your assets will only be <strong>800 million</strong> after 40 years, a difference of nearly 20 times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: What should be the order of borrowing? Mortgage, personal loan, stock pledgeâ€”which takes priority?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You can use lower-interest mortgages or personal loans to borrow funds and invest them in the market (buy QQQ/00662), and then use the money borrowed from stock pledging to pay the monthly installments of the mortgage or personal loan. This frees up your salary, allowing 100% of it to be reinvested, creating a powerful positive cycle. This is the most efficient way to grow wealth.</li>

<li>Question: He would like to ask the teacher&rsquo;s opinion on these two news items.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This information is all &ldquo;<strong>demons and ghosts</strong>&rdquo;; you must dispel them with facts. The so-called &ldquo;unprofitable AI companies&rdquo; refer to small startups, which is normal. But the large tech companies in the QQQ components that we invest in (like Meta, Google, Microsoft) are not only profitable but are also growing rapidly, especially in the B2B sector, where AI is generating very substantial revenue.

</li>
<li>Question 2: How should we view the Buffett Indicator (Total US Stock Market Cap / GDP Ratio) being at a historical high, suggesting the market is overvalued?

Comparing your one-year salary to your decades of total assets and then saying your assets are in a bubble is completely illogical. This indicator has no reference value.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: He feels that the more he learns, the harder it is to communicate with friends who don&rsquo;t understand investing.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: That shouldn&rsquo;t be the case. In theory, <strong>the more you know, the easier it should be to communicate with others in simpler, more accessible terms</strong>, just like a university professor can explain complex mathematical concepts to a middle school student. The key to communication is to listen and adjust your frequency to match the other person&rsquo;s, rather than adopting a &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; mentality. If the other person cannot accept it, you can say, &ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; and end the conversation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing 2: When he talks about investing with friends, their first reaction is always &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have money,&rdquo; and they hope to find a &ldquo;guaranteed profit, no-risk&rdquo; method.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is the &ldquo;fatalistic&rdquo; thinking instilled in many people by their families of origin and culture, such as &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no such thing as a free lunch&rdquo; and &ldquo;only hard work leads to wealth.&rdquo; The truth is, <strong>it is very difficult to become rich through work alone. Only those who understand financial operations and investing can achieve financial freedom</strong>. The financial system in the United States (like the 401k) encourages the entire population to invest, whereas many emerging countries are still stuck in the stage of encouraging hard work alone.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1 (The Importance of Roth): She is in the US, and one of the biggest changes after getting to know the teacher was converting all her 401k to Roth. She reminds everyone that a Traditional 401k is only tax-deferred, not tax-free. For those who know how to invest, retirement accounts will grow to a very large amount, and withdrawals from a traditional account will face terrifying tax rates. Young people must choose Roth.</li>
<li>Sharing 2 (New US Tax Law Rule): As a payroll system expert, she shared a new rule effective in 2025: for people over 50 with an annual income exceeding $145,000, their additional &ldquo;Catch-up&rdquo; contributions can only be put into a Roth 401k, no longer into a pre-tax Traditional 401k.</li>
<li>Sharing 3 (Pledging vs. Selling): She strongly agrees with the teacher&rsquo;s &ldquo;chicken and golden egg&rdquo; analogy. Selling stocks is like killing the chicken that lays golden eggs. Not only is the chicken gone, but you also have to pay taxes on the income from selling the chicken, which is a double loss. Pledging allows the chicken to continue laying eggs; you are just borrowing some future eggs. It is a superior strategy.</li>
<li>Question: She is planning her post-retirement operational sequence: first, sell company stock and convert to QQQ; then, convert SPY to QQQ; and finally, convert Traditional 401k to Roth annually as needed. She asks if this sequence is reasonable.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The sequence is reasonable. The key is to calculate and control the annual operations to fall within the ideal tax bracket. He also suggests that she can allocate some cash within her Traditional 401k to slow its growth rate, thereby reducing the future tax burden upon conversion. However, she should also be careful not to sacrifice too much of the overall portfolio&rsquo;s return (Beta) in the process.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: If my company&rsquo;s 401k investment options are very poor, should I give it up and only invest in a brokerage account?

<blockquote>
<p>The market has no ceiling, it will only go higher, so you don&rsquo;t have to do anything, you don&rsquo;t have to worry, it will hit new highs and bring you immense wealth.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: At the beginning of the session, the teacher emphasized the mindset investors should haveâ€”a firm belief in the long-term upward trend of the market, which is the cornerstone of adopting a &ldquo;buy and hold&rdquo; strategy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investing can&rsquo;t be taught, it can only be learned by oneself. You won&rsquo;t get it just by listening to me. If you don&rsquo;t learn it yourself, you won&rsquo;t get it.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: After introducing numerous learning tools, the teacher stressed the importance of proactive learning and self-exploration in the field of investment. Attending lectures is just the starting point; true understanding requires personal practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are in Taiwan, your money should be in Taiwan.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When answering Bruce&rsquo;s question about his son&rsquo;s US dollar income in Hong Kong, the teacher gave this clear and concise principle, emphasizing that funds should be consistent with one&rsquo;s place of residence for ease of management and tax compliance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This (pledging or not) is the difference between being rich and being super-rich.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When explaining why one should use stock pledging, the teacher used an example showing a nearly twenty-fold difference in assets after 40 years, vividly illustrating the huge impact of using (or not using) leverage tools on the ultimate scale of wealth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your salary is the so-called GDP, and your salary increase is GDP growth. Your assets are the result of past accumulation, so our market value is the result of past accumulation.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When refuting the bearish market argument that the &ldquo;Market Cap to GDP ratio is too high,&rdquo; the teacher used the analogy of personal salary versus total assets to clearly reveal the logical fallacy of this indicator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more you know, the easier it should be to communicate with people.
&ndash; Teacher James
Background: In response to a student&rsquo;s confusion about finding it harder to communicate as they learn more, the teacher pointed out that true wisdom is demonstrated by the ability to simplify complexity and communicate effectively with people at different levels of understanding.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you just sell stocks&hellip; you are essentially killing one of your chickens. Not only will this chicken no longer lay eggs for you, but the chicken itself is also gone.
&ndash; Penny</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: In her sharing, Penny used the vivid &ldquo;killing the goose that lays the golden eggs&rdquo; analogy to profoundly explain the essential difference and the pros and cons between selling stocks for living expenses and using stock pledging to borrow funds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely impossible to become wealthy through work. People who work longer might even become poorer. Only those who understand will become rich, and those who know how to borrow money will become super-rich.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Commenting on the prevalent societal belief of &ldquo;getting rich through hard work,&rdquo; the teacher revealed the truth about wealth growth, emphasizing the importance of financial literacy and the skillful use of leverage.</p>

<p>This session began by reaffirming the investment anchor of &ldquo;buy and hold, never sell,&rdquo; instilling strong confidence in investors amidst a volatile market. Teacher James and senior student Chen Feng detailed the newly integrated AI learning platform, tools that will significantly enhance students&rsquo; efficiency in self-directed learning. The core discussion, through an analysis of asset allocation strategies for young people and high-net-worth individuals, clearly outlined a path to wealth from accumulation to the skillful use of capital. The in-depth interpretation of stock pledging, in particular, revealed its immense potential as a wealth amplifier. The Q&amp;A session was exceptionally insightful, not only solving students&rsquo; specific problems in areas like taxation, retirement planning, and asset allocation but also providing profound inspiration regarding investment mindset, communication wisdom, and information discernment. This was a comprehensive sharing that covered everything from the Tao (investment philosophy) to the techniques (specific strategies) and the tools (learning instruments).</p>

<p>This session revolves around the core concept of long-term investingâ€”a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; approach. James emphasizes that investors should ignore short-term market fluctuations, macroeconomic data, financial reports, and even political news, and instead, stick to buying and holding high-quality assets (like QQQ) for the long term. The key to success is not in predicting market highs and lows, but in proper risk management, which means using sensible asset allocation and maintaining sufficient cash reserves to handle any market condition.

<li><strong>&ldquo;Do Nothing&rdquo; Approach</strong>: The best investment strategy is to buy and then leave it alone; the market will naturally reach new highs. Trying to manage or predict the market is more likely to lead to failure.</li>
<li><strong>Ignore Market Noise</strong>: Investors don&rsquo;t need to care about what Trump or Putin says, nor should they pay attention to economic data like PPI and CPI or company earnings reports. This short-term information is irrelevant to long-term investing.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Time</strong>: Investing requires a long-term view, at least a 20-year horizon. Thinking about the person you want to become in 20 years is more meaningful than worrying about tomorrow&rsquo;s market. Getting rich overnight is impossible, but going bankrupt overnight is common, which is why risk control is crucial.</li>

<li><strong>Stock Pledging</strong>: When pledging stocks, you must also understand asset allocation and keep enough cash on hand to deal with market fluctuations, avoiding a margin call due to a market downturn.</li>

<li><strong>Opportunity Cost is a Real Loss</strong>: Short-term paper losses are temporary and non-existent. However, the gains you miss out on due to hesitation (the money you could have earned) are a permanent and tangible loss.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If QQQ rises from 400 to 577, and you didn&rsquo;t buy at 400, you have permanently lost that 177 in profit. This loss can never be recovered.</li>

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: The decision to work should not be based on fear of the future (like AI replacing jobs). You should ask yourself: Do you like your job?

<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;arbitrage&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s &ldquo;having no way out.&rdquo; Moving to a place you don&rsquo;t genuinely like just to save money is a form of external diseconomy and is not advisable. We should strive to live in an environment we like and find convenient, not be forced into a choice because of a lack of money. If you move to Hualien or Taitung because they are beautiful, that&rsquo;s the right choice even if it costs more than Taipei. But if it&rsquo;s just to save money, it&rsquo;s the wrong choice.</li>

<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Your understanding is completely correct. The only indicator of a bubble, as Howard Marks says, is that &ldquo;investors have gone crazy&rdquo;; there are no other quantitative metrics.

<li>Sharing: She introduced James&rsquo;s investment philosophy to a very conservative elder, who ultimately only agreed to invest NT$20,000 per month into 006208 (a Taiwanese ETF) on a regular basis. She feels a bit anxious about this, thinking it&rsquo;s too slow.</li>
<li>Question: This elder insists they have an insurance policy bought 30-40 years ago with an 8% return. She suspects this was just a sales pitch from the agent back then and wants to ask how to explain to the elder that the actual return on this policy is likely not that high.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: First, don&rsquo;t be anxious. If the person involved isn&rsquo;t in a hurry, we shouldn&rsquo;t be either. You don&rsquo;t know if your advice will save them or harm them. What if they invest and the market drops in the short term? They will blame you. Taking it slow is a good thing. Regarding the insurance policy, an 8% return is almost impossible. You need to calculate the actual annualized rate of return (IRR or XIRR), not a simple arithmetic average. Especially considering the funds invested early on were locked up for 20-30 years with no return, the opportunity cost during that period is enormous. A rough estimate shows that if the same money (NT$750,000 invested annually for 20 years) were put into the market (at a 10% annualized return), it would become NT$100 million after 28 years. The policy, however, only pays out NT$1 million per year, making the return not even 1%. It&rsquo;s essentially a product from a &ldquo;scam group.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Sharing: A follow-up on family financial communication. He realized that for large investments (like consolidating a mortgage to free up several million), he must get his wife&rsquo;s consent. His current strategy is &ldquo;slowly might be faster,&rdquo; gradually gaining his wife&rsquo;s understanding and trust through continuous communication, sharing small gains, and explaining the long-term philosophy. He believes it&rsquo;s very important for a couple to be on the same page; otherwise, even if he makes money from investments, it could cause family conflicts.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Your approach is absolutely correct. Take it slow, and make sure your spouse feels involved and secure. For example, you can put a portion of the money from the loan into your wife&rsquo;s account for her to manage. When she sees cash in the account, she will feel more at ease. Never make decisions on your own. Even if you succeed, your partner might get angry for not being respected, which could lead to a broken marriage.</li>

<li>Question: James mentioned that one of the three principles of asset allocation is to consider the extreme scenario of &ldquo;interest rates rising to infinity.&rdquo; He is worried that if a situation like the 1980s in the U.S. occurs, with interest rates as high as 20%, our current backtesting models based on the last 20 years of data might not hold up. Is he worrying too much?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This is an excellent question. The way to deal with such an extreme situation is to hold more cash. If you are worried about a &ldquo;stagflation&rdquo; environment like the 1970s-1980s, where the stock market stagnated and interest rates were high, then your initial cash allocation should be higher, for example, increasing it from 30% to 40% or even 50%. Your cash reserve determines how much risk you can withstand.</li>

<li><strong>On Overseas Brokers (like Futu)</strong>: James strongly advises Taiwanese investors against using overseas brokers like Futu. The main risks are: 1. Issues with the Alternative Minimum Tax. 2. High estate taxes (potentially up to 40%). 3. If the investor has an accident, their heirs may not even find this account, and the inheritance process will be extremely difficult.</li>
<li><strong>On Exchange Rates</strong>: Investing is a decades-long endeavor; don&rsquo;t pay attention to short-term currency fluctuations. In the long run, exchange rates will fluctuate within a range and eventually converge to an expected value. Worrying about exchange rates will prevent you from doing anything.</li>
<li><strong>On the Cash Portion</strong>: The &ldquo;cash&rdquo; portion of asset allocation should absolutely not be invested in high-dividend stocks. High-dividend stocks are still stocks, they will fall, and they do not have the stability of cash. Cash should be allocated to truly safe assets like a Money Market Fund or short-term government bonds.</li>

<p>Background: At the beginning of the session, James emphasized the long-term conviction investors should have, and not to feel fear or try to predict the top just because the market is making new highs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The money you miss out on earning is a permanent loss for your entire life&hellip; Earning less is a tangible loss.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When explaining why one should &ldquo;buy immediately with available cash,&rdquo; James pointed out that opportunity cost is a real and permanent loss, far more terrifying than short-term paper losses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You could have billions and not be able to spend it all, yet you&rsquo;re thinking of moving to a backward place&hellip; (just to save money) that&rsquo;s called having no way out.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When commenting on &ldquo;geographic arbitrage,&rdquo; James sharply pointed out that sacrificing quality of life and moving to an undesirable, cheap area due to financial constraints is not a wise move.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seeing others suffer, it&rsquo;s hard for us to save them&hellip; It&rsquo;s like Jesus, he spoke to someone&hellip; but then the person ran away because they didn&rsquo;t have enough money&hellip; and Jesus had to let go, there was nothing he could do.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: In answering Edwin&rsquo;s question on how to adjust his mindset when facing friends and family he can&rsquo;t help, James used this analogy to explain that all we can do is pass on the information. Whether the other person accepts it is beyond our control, and we must learn to let go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slowly might be faster.
&ndash; Jason</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Jason summarized this philosophical phrase when sharing his experience communicating investment concepts with his family, emphasizing the importance of patience and continuous communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a husband and wife are of one mind, they can break through metal. If they are not&hellip; even if you succeed, she might fly into a rage, &lsquo;You do everything without telling me.&rsquo;
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When commenting on family financial communication, James stressed the extreme importance of spousal consensus, otherwise even successful investments could destroy the family relationship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I said your [insurance policy] doesn&rsquo;t even pay out when it should, and he said, &lsquo;how much premium did you pay?&rsquo;&hellip; Wow, is that what you call insurance?
&ndash; James
Background: Recalling a debate with an insurance professional, James revealed the nature of some insurance products where the &ldquo;payout limit is tied to the premium paid,&rdquo; pointing out the limitations of their protective function.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take that fifteen million to buy insurance, you could have a hundred million&hellip; you only get one million a year&hellip; that&rsquo;s just taking one percent, and you&rsquo;re still smiling happily about it.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Through calculation, James revealed the extremely low rate of return on long-term savings insurance. Compared to investing in the market over the same period, the difference in returns is immense, representing a huge opportunity cost loss.</p>

</h2>
<p>This session once again reinforced the core idea of CLEC&rsquo;s long-term investing: simplify investment decisions and embrace the market&rsquo;s long-term growth. Through the concept of a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; approach, James urged investors to break free from the interference of short-term market noise and to focus on building a robust, personalized asset allocation, always maintaining sufficient cash as the ultimate defense against risk. The Q&amp;A session covered multiple dimensions, from personal mindset adjustments and family financial communication to the analysis of financial products like insurance. Using vivid examples and sharp insights, James exposed many common investment fallacies. The most central takeaway is that investing is a marathon of patience and discipline; taking immediate action and persisting for the long term is far more important than trying to find the perfect timing and valuation.</p>

Choosing the wrong target can lead to slow wealth growth, akin to becoming poorer. Second, it emphasizes the critical importance of financial communication with spouses, parents, and family members on the path to wealth through investment. Consensus should be built through continuous and frank discussions to avoid family relationship breakdowns over money issues.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<lite-youtube videoid="97CcSE_y780" playlabel="97CcSE_y780" params=""></lite-youtube>

<p>This session&rsquo;s core viewpoints from Teacher James revolve around two main areas:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Decisive Nature of Investment Choices</strong>: Not all index funds can make you rich. Through detailed data comparisons, the teacher reveals the huge long-term return gap between QQQ and other index funds like SPY and VT, emphasizing the decisive role of choosing the right investment target (like QQQ) for wealth accumulation.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Financial Communication</strong>: On the road to wealth through investment, maintaining family relationships (especially with spouses and parents) is crucial. The teacher advocates for building financial consensus and trust among family members through continuous, &ldquo;chatter-style&rdquo; communication, sharing responsibilities, and avoiding family conflicts sparked by wealth growth.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communication with a Spouse</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Constant Chatter&rdquo; Method</strong>: It&rsquo;s recommended to share investment ideas, operations, and progress with your spouse in the form of daily conversation. This isn&rsquo;t for them to fully understand, but to give them a sense of participation and the right to be informed, building synchronization and trust. For example, casually mention what you bought more of today, what class you attended, or any new ideas you have.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Responsibility</strong>: Communicating from the start to reach a consensus gives both partners a sense of ownership in the decisions. Whether there are profits or losses, you can face them together, avoiding one person bearing all the pressure and getting unappreciated for their efforts. The teacher uses his company management as an example: his subordinates know all the information he does, so responsibilities are shared, and the manager feels no pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Secrets, Honesty is Respect</strong>: There should be no financial secrets from your spouse. Say what&rsquo;s on your mind; this is a form of respect. Making decisions alone, regardless of success or failure, can pose a risk to the family relationship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Communication with Parents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Planning and Gentle Communication</strong>: When parents are approaching retirement age (50s-60s), you should begin discussing future financial and care arrangements. Use a caring tone and examples (like the sudden situations of neighbor Mrs. Chang or Uncle Li) to gradually &ldquo;brainwash&rdquo; them, rather than forcefully demanding management rights.</li>
<li><strong>The Role of Children</strong>: Children who have learned about finance should bravely take on the role of the family CFO (Chief Financial Officer), responsible for financial planning, investment management, and payment systems, while keeping clear accounts and reporting to the family regularly.</li>
<li><strong>Elder Care Trusts</strong>: If parents are not comfortable entrusting their money to a single child, or if the children cannot reach a consensus, consider setting up an &ldquo;Elder Care Trust.&rdquo; The bank would be responsible for management and payments, and some banks even allow specifying investment targets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Practice of Caring for Parents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevention is Better Than Cure</strong>: Care for your parents should start with daily life, paying attention to their &ldquo;eating, drinking, defecating, urinating, and sleeping.&rdquo; Take them for regular health check-ups (for the &ldquo;three highs&rdquo; - high blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar), monitor their vision (e.g., get injections for macular degeneration early, even if you have to pay out-of-pocket), hearing (e.g., get hearing aids from Costco early), knees, and other body &ldquo;parts,&rdquo; intervening at the first sign of a problem.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Sleep</strong>: Understand your parents&rsquo; sleep situation. If they don&rsquo;t sleep well, you can discuss solutions, such as trying Melatonin, and avoid sleeping pills with significant side effects.</li>
<li><strong>Health is the Children&rsquo;s Happiness</strong>: When parents are healthy and can take care of themselves, it is the greatest happiness for their children. Don&rsquo;t wait until they are bedridden to start managing; the family burden will be extremely heavy by then.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Astonishing Long-Term Performance Differences</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>40 years</strong>: QQQ had an annualized return of 14%, while SPY (S&amp;P 500) was only 8.95%â€”a huge gap.</li>
<li><strong>17 years</strong>: QQQ&rsquo;s annualized return was 15.8%, SPY/VOO/VTI was about 9.6%, while VT (Total World Stock) was a meager 5.7%.</li>
<li><strong>10 years</strong>: QQQ&rsquo;s annualized return was 18.17%, SPY was 11.8%, and VT was only 7.8%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Those who invest in QQQ might become &ldquo;billionaires,&rdquo; those in SPY are &ldquo;wealthy people,&rdquo; and those in VT might become &ldquo;poor people who think they are rich.&rdquo; If the direction is wrong, all effort is wasted.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Correction</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: What if I have already bought SPY, VOO, or VT, especially in the US where I have to pay taxes?</li>
<li><strong>Answer</strong>: You must sell! Pay for past mistakes, pay the tax once, but in return, you get much higher long-term returns in the future. Don&rsquo;t cling to the wrong assets for a lifetime just to save a little on taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Sunk Cost</strong>: It&rsquo;s like finding out the elevator is broken and switching to another one immediately, not stubbornly waiting in the broken one. It&rsquo;s also like realizing a relationship isn&rsquo;t working after five years; you can&rsquo;t continue down the wrong path just because you&rsquo;ve invested five years.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>From Money Anxiety to Magnanimity</strong>: Taking the sharing from student Michael as an example, he used to have anxiety about money because he was afraid of spending it. After getting rich through investing, his life got better and better, but more importantly, his mindset changed. He learned to use money with magnanimity for physical and mental health and family happiness. Letting go of money anxiety can improve relationships with family.</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;C&rdquo; Investment Philosophy</strong>: Aims to eliminate poverty and people&rsquo;s anxiety about money. We should not be slaves to capital, but capitalists. &ldquo;Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right.&rdquo; We should live a worthy life.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation Principles</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash is King</strong>: Keep at least 30% in cash. Cash is the &ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark&rdquo; of investing; it can save your life.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Leverage</strong>: For those who want to use leverage but are afraid of the risk, you can start with a lower Beta (e.g., 0.5-0.7) and gradually get used to it.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy for Young People</strong>: Even with little capital, you must first establish an emergency fund. For example, if you only have 200,000 TWD but your annual living expenses are 300,000 TWD, you cannot invest this 200,000. You should save up the emergency fund first, and then invest the rest.</li>

<li>Question: I am 27 this year. How should I prepare for my parents&rsquo; (around 60) future medical expenses? About how much money is needed?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Based on my mother&rsquo;s experience (she had 6 million TWD prepared when she started needing care at age 80), and considering inflation, one parent might need about 10 million TWD in 20 years. I suggest you start now, saving at least 10,000 TWD per month for your parents, and separately save for your own retirement. More importantly, start paying attention to your parents&rsquo; health now. Take them to the metabolism department for regular check-ups (like blood sugar, cholesterol) and address hearing and vision problems promptly. Prevention is better than cure.</li>

<li>Question: The retirement account at my current company (TIAA) does not offer QQQ, but my previous company&rsquo;s retirement account (Fidelity) does. What should I do?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: First, for the account from the job you&rsquo;ve already left, you can do a Rollover into an IRA account, which will allow you to freely invest in QQQ. For your current company&rsquo;s underperforming retirement account, I suggest you stop contributing to it. You should prioritize maxing out your Roth IRA, and put the rest of your money directly into your own Brokerage Account to buy QQQ.</li>

<li>Question: After my sister took the teacher&rsquo;s class, she canceled more than a dozen insurance policies, took out a personal loan, and invested heavily in 00662 (the Taiwanese QQQ equivalent). Our family thinks she&rsquo;s &ldquo;gone off the deep end.&rdquo; Many people around us still advocate for individual stocks. May I ask why the teacher himself switched from investing in individual stocks to exclusively recommending index funds?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I invested in individual stocks for over 30 years. Although my performance was good, after taxes, I didn&rsquo;t truly beat QQQ. More critically, individual stock trading requires real-time buy/sell instructions. For a community of tens of thousands of students like we have now, I cannot provide timely notifications, which would cause losses for everyone. Therefore, abandoning complex individual stock picking, which may not even yield better results in the end, and turning to simple, transparent index investing with excellent long-term returns is the most responsible and effective method for everyone.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I don&rsquo;t recommend it. The biggest problem with 00757 is its &ldquo;unpredictability.&rdquo; Its stock selection logic is not transparent (why these 10 stocks?), and its volatility is unknown, which makes it impossible for you to do scientific asset allocation. Its performance is not necessarily better than the predictable QLD (00670L, the 2x leveraged QQQ). The so-called &ldquo;mean reversion&rdquo; does not exist between assets of different natures (e.g., apples and oranges don&rsquo;t revert to each other). Instead of investing in a fund you don&rsquo;t understand, it&rsquo;s better to build your own &ldquo;top ten&rdquo; portfolio based on QQQ&rsquo;s holdings, which has a clearer logic.</li>

<li>Question: I would like to ask the teacher&rsquo;s view on &ldquo;history.&rdquo; How should we view ancient wisdom in relation to modern development?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I divide history into two parts. One part is timeless, spiritual wisdom (like Laozi, Zhuangzi, Socrates). This is eternal, and we should learn and think about how to &ldquo;take and use&rdquo; it in our real lives. The other part is humanity&rsquo;s animal nature (like cruelty, selfishness). I&rsquo;ve observed that this aspect has not changed from ancient times to the present, despite advances in material civilization. When we study history, the focus should be on drawing lessons and applying them, not just criticizing or admiring.</li>

<li>Question: I use a sub-brokerage account in Taiwan to buy QQQ and then never sell. Is this okay? And if I have a large home equity line of credit, is it good to keep it as an emergency fund?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: No, that&rsquo;s not okay. The problems are: 1. <strong>Taxes</strong>: When your assets grow to tens of millions, you will eventually need the money, and as soon as you sell, you will face high capital gains taxes. 2. <strong>Opportunity Cost</strong>: Keeping your HELOC credit line as cash is a huge waste. You should borrow all the money you can and invest it in the market. Even just buying short-term bonds (like 00865B in Taiwan) for arbitrage is better than letting the money sleep in the bank. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of the debt figure; look at the growth potential of your assets. The market is always at a low point. You must act immediately, right now.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Investment hesitation is the biggest mistake.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: At the beginning of the session, the teacher emphasized that the market doesn&rsquo;t wait when it&rsquo;s rising. The hesitant mentality of not buying whether the market is up or down is the biggest mistake in investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t avoid doing the right thing just to save on taxes.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When answering a student&rsquo;s question about whether to sell SPY/VOO to switch to QQQ, the teacher stressed that even if it means paying taxes, one should decisively correct wrong investment decisions to focus on the correct long-term returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must do a smart rebalance every year with leveraged funds, or you will be wiped out overnight.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When explaining how to hold leveraged ETFs like TQQQ and QLD, the teacher repeatedly emphasized that these products must be managed with an annual &ldquo;smart rebalance&rdquo; to lock in profits and control risk; otherwise, long-term holding could lead to returns diminishing to zero.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;ve read so many books, now put them to use!
&ndash; Teacher James (quoting a general manager)</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When discussing how to learn from history and philosophy, the teacher emphasized that the ultimate purpose of knowledge is practice. If you read the classics, you must think about how to apply them in your life; otherwise, no amount of knowledge is more than just garbage in your head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The market is always at a low point.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When encouraging students to overcome their fear of heights and invest immediately, the teacher pointed out that relative to the future price (e.g., QQQ potentially reaching 50,000 points), any current price should be considered a low point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Explaining the philosophy of C-position investment and financial education, the core of which is to help people break free from money anxiety and live a happy, fulfilling life where they realize their self-worth, rather than being slaves to money.</p>

<p>This session once again reinforced the core strategies and philosophy of C-position investment and financial management. In terms of investment strategy, it irrefutably demonstrated the superiority of QQQ as a core asset through detailed data comparisons, urging students to have the courage to correct past investment mistakes, even if it incurs some tax costs. On the philosophy of life and family relations, the teacher profoundly pointed out that wealth growth must go hand-in-hand with family harmony. The key to achieving this is continuous, honest financial communication built on a foundation of trust. Whether it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;constant chatter&rdquo; sharing between spouses or the patient guidance for parents, the goal is to build a family financial system based on consensus and shared responsibility. Ultimately, the course guides us back to the origin of investing: to use capital as a tool to achieve a happy and meaningful life, free from anxiety about money.</p>

<p>The core theme of this session is <strong>how to unlock the value of real estate through financial instruments, converting fixed assets into liquid capital for investment, thereby achieving exponential wealth growth</strong>. The instructor details two methods, &ldquo;reverse mortgages&rdquo; and &ldquo;investment-type home equity loans,&rdquo; and emphasizes that in Taiwan&rsquo;s low-interest-rate environment, borrowing to invest is a powerful lever for ordinary people to accumulate wealth. At the same time, the course reiterates that future wealth gaps will be primarily determined by the choice of investment vehicles, with those investing in high-tech indexes (like the Nasdaq-100) pulling far ahead of those investing in traditional broad market indexes.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: A friend working in bank lending suggested that the instructor share the concept of &ldquo;reverse mortgages,&rdquo; which is an excellent option for many retirees who have insufficient funds but own a mortgage-free home.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of &ldquo;Investment-Type Home Equity Loans&rdquo;</strong>: For retirees without a stable source of income, applying for an &ldquo;investment-type home equity loan&rdquo; is highly risky.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Suppose you borrow TWD 10 million at a 2.4% annual interest rate, requiring TWD 240,000 in annual interest payments. However, according to our investment principles, you can only safely withdraw 2% of this TWD 10 million asset annually (which is TWD 200,000). Since the interest expense exceeds the usable amount, it results in negative cash flow, which is very risky.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of &ldquo;Reverse Mortgages&rdquo;</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: Individuals who are retired, have no income, are unable to qualify for an investment-type home equity loan, but own a mortgage-free property and have insufficient investment capital to support their retirement.</li>
<li><strong>Core Benefit</strong>: Through a reverse mortgage, you can receive a stable monthly cash flow for living expenses, while your original investment principal of several million or ten million TWD can remain untouched to continue compounding in the market. This is equivalent to &ldquo;borrowing money to live, while letting your own assets continue to grow.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Information from Taiwanese Banks</strong>: The instructor provided information from institutions like Bank of Taiwan for &ldquo;reverse mortgages,&rdquo; with interest rates around 2.2% to 2.6% and loan terms typically up to 30 years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conditions for Investment-Type Home Equity Loans</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Rate</strong>: The current rate for a general investment-type home equity loan is about 2.59%.</li>
<li><strong>Restrictions</strong>: There are requirements on the age of the property and the loan term (e.g., building age + loan term &lt; 60). This could limit young people who buy older, second-hand homes from accessing this service in the future.</li>

<li><strong>Preventive Measures</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Do Not Cancel the Mortgage Lien</strong>: Even if the mortgage is fully paid off, it is recommended not to go to the land administration office to cancel the bank&rsquo;s mortgage lien. Keeping this registered lien adds a layer of security.</li>
<li><strong>Apply for Two Services</strong>: Children can take their parents to the household registration office to apply for &ldquo;<strong>Advance Notice Registration</strong>&rdquo; (to prevent the property from being arbitrarily transferred or sold) and the &ldquo;<strong>Real-time Land Registry Alert</strong>&rdquo; service (which sends an immediate notification if there are any changes to the property&rsquo;s land registry data).</li>

<li><strong>Instructor&rsquo;s View</strong>: High living costs are a common phenomenon in the United States. Taking himself as an example, his monthly HOA fees plus utilities, internet, etc., amount to over $1,100 before even buying food. He reminds everyone to carefully inspect the property condition and contract terms and to clarify all fees before signing a lease.</li>

<li><strong>Future Wealth Will Be More Concentrated</strong>: Artificial intelligence and digital finance will accelerate the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few companies and individuals. In the future, it could be that 0.1% of the population controls 80% of the wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Choosing the Right Vehicle is Crucial</strong>: Between investing and not investing, your assets will differ by two zeros. For those who invest in indexes, the assets of those who choose the wrong indexes (like VT, VOO, SPY) versus the right one (QQQ) will also differ by two zeros in the future. People investing in high-dividend stocks or SPY may become relatively poor in the future.</li>
<li><strong>The Purpose of Asset Allocation</strong>: The quality of an asset allocation and rebalancing strategy is not determined by the strategy itself, but by <strong>future market conditions</strong>. Since we cannot predict the future, the primary purpose of asset allocation is to <strong>give you peace of mind, enabling you to endure the worst market periods (like a continuous ten-year decline)</strong>, rather than pursuing the highest short-term performance.</li>
<li><strong>On Educating Children</strong>: When facing a child&rsquo;s problem, analyze whether it&rsquo;s a lack of &ldquo;ability&rdquo; or a lack of &ldquo;willingness.&rdquo; A lack of ability requires &ldquo;teaching,&rdquo; while a lack of willingness requires &ldquo;encouragement.&rdquo; Plant good seeds and nurture them with love, companionship, and positive energy.</li>
<li><strong>Become a Capitalist, Free from Money Worries</strong>: By understanding investment and becoming a capitalist, you can free yourself and the next generation from the fear and anxiety of money, achieve generational wealth, and possess the right to be happy.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Seniors in Taiwan are in a pitiful situation now because landlords, fearing that an elderly person might pass away in the property and turn it into a &ldquo;stigmatized property&rdquo; affecting its value, are unwilling to rent to them.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This is actually an excuse by landlords; legally, a natural death does not constitute a stigmatized property. The fundamental problem is poverty. If you become wealthy, you won&rsquo;t have housing problems. The lack of investment and financial literacy education in Taiwan makes it difficult for many people to accumulate wealth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: I bought 00662 at a high point of 93 earlier this year. Even though the US QQQ has reached a new high, my 00662 has not yet broken even because the Taiwan dollar has appreciated. I feel anxious. Should I use a sub-brokerage account to buy the US stock QQQ directly?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: This is a normal phenomenon caused by exchange rates. If you convert the price of QQQ at its peak back then using the higher exchange rate at the time (e.g., 33), you would find that its value in TWD also hasn&rsquo;t reached a new high. It&rsquo;s essentially the same, so there&rsquo;s no need to worry about exchange rates. If you&rsquo;re in Taiwan, just buy 00662 with TWD. Buy whenever you have money, and don&rsquo;t worry about exchange rates or short-term market fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: I have a USD-denominated insurance policy with a 3.5% annualized return that I want to cancel, but I&rsquo;m worried about the unfavorable exchange rate for converting it back to TWD now. This money is for my child. Should I allocate it as 50% 00662 and 50% 00670L (a leveraged ETF)?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: A 3.5% return is too low; you should cancel it decisively. Don&rsquo;t worry about the short-term exchange rate, because after you convert to TWD and buy 00662, the nature of the asset reverts to a USD asset. For a 30-year investment for your child, the simplest and safest way is to buy 100% 00662 and hold it for the long term. If you must include leverage, you can, but you must understand its risks and rebalance properly. Otherwise, simply holding 00662 is better.</li>

He also shared a real-life case of his 72-year-old elder who applied for a &ldquo;reverse mortgage&rdquo;: for a TWD 7 million house, they can receive TWD 17,000 per month for 23 years. He believes this allows the elder to age with dignity and also frees up the children&rsquo;s funds. The filial piety money saved by the children can be invested to create even greater wealth.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This is an excellent sharing. This is the essence of a &ldquo;reverse mortgage.&rdquo; If the children invest the saved TWD 17,000 per month, at a 12% annualized rate of return, it will grow to over TWD 52 million in 30 years. This is equivalent to using a TWD 7 million loan from the bank to create tens of millions in additional wealthâ€”a very smart financial move.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Fubon Bank has a 20-year revolving investment-type home equity loan product. She thinks it&rsquo;s better for young people than a reverse mortgage and suggests everyone look into it.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: There is no capital gains tax in Taiwan. In retirement, will it still be necessary to live off funds from a stock-pledged loan? Can I just sell the bond portion of my asset allocation for expenses?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: You don&rsquo;t have to use a pledged loan, but your wealth will grow much slower. He gives an example: with TWD 50 million in assets, if you sell 2% each year to live on (assuming a 10% rate of return), it will grow to TWD 2.2 billion in 40 years. If you live off a pledged loan and leave the principal untouched (assuming a 12% rate of return), it will grow to TWD 4.6 billion in 40 yearsâ€”more than double the amount. The risk of pledging is controllable, but the return is enormous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: If I want to withdraw 3% annually, but my total assets are not yet large, should I switch to the less volatile SPY?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: No need. You can achieve this by adjusting the Beta of your asset allocation, for example, by using a 70-30 or 4-2-4 allocation while still holding QQQ, and you can still safely withdraw 3%.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: She discovered that an older colleague&rsquo;s retirement account balance was only one-third of hers. The reason was that the colleague chose a very conservative investment model, which fell less but also grew much less. This made her deeply realize the importance of choosing the right investment vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: She was most shocked to learn about the Pledge Asset Line (PAL) from the instructor and immediately opened one. She believes people should not be afraid of PAL. Compared to taking on a huge mortgage with a small down payment, PAL is a small loan based on a substantial asset foundation, making it much less risky. She compares PAL to a &ldquo;future employer&rdquo;â€”whenever you need money, you just go and get it. It&rsquo;s very convenient.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: An excellent sharing. This is the core of financial operations. In Taiwan, with such low interest rates, anyone with property must get an investment-type home equity loan or a reverse mortgage. Not borrowing this cheap money is a huge waste. You can only become truly wealthy if you know how to borrow money safely.</li>

After this session, she decided to immediately research applying for a &ldquo;reverse mortgage.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: She has a &ldquo;mental block&rdquo; about selling her 0050 (Taiwan 50 ETF). She feels that as a Taiwanese person, not holding 0050 means she lacks a &ldquo;sense of participation,&rdquo; and she feels very conflicted.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Emotional matters cannot be measured in money. But from a financial perspective, you should deal with it as soon as possible. He suggests she first go and set up the reverse mortgage. As for pledged loans, she can start by trying a small amount, like pledging TWD 1 million to borrow TWD 100,000 for a trip, just to experience it and gradually develop the habit of &ldquo;borrowing for consumption, letting the principal grow.&rdquo;</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: He just secured a TWD 7.5 million investment-type home equity loan and invested TWD 6 million in 00662. He wants to keep his monthly interest payment around TWD 10,000 and is struggling with a decision: should he use the entire TWD 6 million as his investment base for a 7-3 allocation, or use only TWD 4 million for the allocation and leave the remaining TWD 2 million untouched in the loan account to reduce interest?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: All loan interest should be paid from your salary. The invested TWD 6 million should be managed as a single portfolio. Given that he is still young, he should adopt a more aggressive allocation, such as 5-2-3 or 4-3-3. The cash portion of the allocation (e.g., 30%, which is TWD 1.8 million) should be invested in a high-yield money market fund (like 00865B, with an annualized return of about 4.5%), not left in the non-interest-bearing loan account.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: When rebalancing, if the market drops and I need to add to my leveraged ETF position, should the cash come from the cash position within my brokerage account or be transferred from an external bank account?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: The cash comes from the cash portion of your entire investment portfolio. Ideally, the leveraged fund is in a tax-advantaged account (like an IRA), and the cash for re-buying should also come from the cash position within that same account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: I can start accessing my 401K next year and plan to roll it into an IRA. At that time, living expenses and taxes might strain my cash flow. Should I use a PAL to cover these? What if a major market crash exhausts my PAL limit?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: This is why you keep 30% cash. If a market crash occurs and your brokerage account (where the PAL is) faces a margin call, you should transfer cash (e.g., by selling SWVXX) from your tax-advantaged account like an IRA to the brokerage account as collateral, not transfer stocks. SWVXX has a very high pledge rate (96%), which can effectively boost your collateral value and borrowing capacity. The asset allocation and Beta of your entire investment portfolio (brokerage + IRA) should be calculated and viewed as a whole.</li>

Then, make a fixed monthly transfer from Bank A to Bank B&rsquo;s account (e.g., TWD 7,000 or 10,000).

<p>In the future, it could be that 0.1% of the population will control 80% of the world&rsquo;s wealth&hellip; If you buy VT, VOO, SPY, these people will become poor in the future&hellip; Those of you who buy QQQ will have two more zeros in your assets than those people.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view points out the trend of extreme wealth polarization and emphasizes that choosing a high-growth tech index (QQQ) over traditional broad-market indexes is the key determinant of future wealth magnitude.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our performance is not determined by our asset allocation and rebalancing method; it&rsquo;s determined by what the future market will be, which we don&rsquo;t know. Therefore, the main purpose of our asset allocation is to find a state that gives you peace of mind, allowing you to get through the worst of markets.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view clarifies the fundamental purpose of asset allocationâ€”it&rsquo;s for risk management and the investor&rsquo;s psychological comfort, enabling them to stay in the market for the long haul, rather than for predicting and chasing the highest short-term returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just think of the PAL (Pledge Asset Line) as your future employer. Whenever a month is up or anytime you want to get money, you just go to your PAL to get it.

<p>This is a very vivid metaphor that explains the complex financial tool of &ldquo;pledged loans&rdquo; as a source of cash flow as convenient as receiving a salary, greatly lowering the barrier to understanding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not selling is your ancestor.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>With a humorous and colloquial phrase, the instructor emphasizes the extreme importance of long-term holding and avoiding the sale of assets, subverting the traditional wisdom that &ldquo;knowing when to sell makes you a master.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to get into the habit of borrowing money.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view challenges the traditional &ldquo;debt-free is worry-free&rdquo; concept, emphasizing that in a low-interest-rate environment, learning to use leverage safely and intelligently by borrowing to invest is a crucial habit for accelerating wealth accumulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was born in Taiwan, and if I don&rsquo;t own 0050, it feels like I&rsquo;m not participating. I&rsquo;m just very conflicted internally.

<p>This sentence genuinely reflects the &ldquo;home bias&rdquo; and emotional factors that influence many investors&rsquo; decisions, serving as a very typical and relatable &ldquo;mental block.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This session reinforces the core investment philosophy of CLEC while introducing more specific wealth-growth strategies. Through the cases of &ldquo;reverse mortgages&rdquo; and &ldquo;investment-type home equity loans,&rdquo; the instructor vividly demonstrated how to unlock seemingly &ldquo;dormant&rdquo; real estate and turn it into fuel for wealth growth. The course not only provided operational guidance but, more importantly, continued to shape the investor&rsquo;s mindset: to break the fear of debt and understand the power of leverage; to abandon focus on short-term fluctuations and concentrate on choosing the right long-term track; and to recognize that the essence of wealth is cognition. Only by continuously improving financial literacy can one stand invincible in the future tide of wealth.</p>

<li>Teacher James begins with the experience of a friend&rsquo;s family, strongly urging everyone to prioritize health, especially the early screening for lung cancer.</li>
<li><strong>Core Recommendation</strong>: Friends over 40 in Taiwan should pay for a low-dose computed tomography (Low-Dose CT, LDCT) scan out-of-pocket (around NT$5,000-6,000). Lung cancer is the &ldquo;king of cancers&rdquo; in Taiwan, often asymptomatic in its early stages, but the cure rate is high with early detection.</li>
<li><strong>Screening Frequency</strong>: If the scan is clear, you can do it again every 2-3 years. The latency period for lung adenocarcinoma is relatively long; it might take five years for a tumor to grow from 0.8 cm to 1.6 cm, providing enough time to respond with regular follow-ups.</li>
<li><strong>Added Value</strong>: An LDCT scan can also incidentally check for calcification or blockage in the heart&rsquo;s coronary arteries, serving two purposes at once.</li>
<li><strong>Advice for Overseas Chinese</strong>: For Chinese friends in the United States, since doctors there typically do not order such scans without symptoms, you might consider booking a self-paid health check-up at a teaching hospital in Taiwan a month and a half in advance when you travel back.</li>
<li><strong>Health is Fundamental</strong>: The teacher emphasizes that without health, all wealth is meaningless.</li>

<li><strong>Ignore Currency Fluctuations</strong>: Taking the 00662 fund as an example, although it is a USD-denominated product priced in TWD, its net value is affected by the TWD/USD exchange rate. However, over the long term (e.g., 30 years), the impact of exchange rates will smooth out. Investors should completely ignore currency fluctuations and focus on the growth of the asset itself.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Away from Wrong Products</strong>: Young people should not invest in high-dividend products, as they will only make you poorer. Also, be wary of insurance, annuities, and similar products, which the teacher calls &ldquo;products from a scam syndicate.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Adhere to Index Funds</strong>: It is only recommended to invest in broad-based index funds like the Nasdaq-100 (e.g., QQQ, 00662). Don&rsquo;t be misled by other ETFs on the market that are not true to their name.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Critique of &ldquo;Involution&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hardship&rdquo; Culture</strong>: The prevalent cultures of &ldquo;treating hardship as a tonic&rdquo; and &ldquo;involution&rdquo; in Asian societies lead to an increasingly difficult life for everyone. The teacher advocates for learning from Western thinking, realizing that we are not born to be laborers or slaves.</li>
<li><strong>The Intent Behind the Word &ldquo;Slave&rdquo;</strong>: The teacher deliberately uses the word &ldquo;slave&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;laborer&rdquo; to make the audience uncomfortable and thus spark an awakening. Under modern capitalism, apart from capitalists, most people are essentially &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; serving capital, to be discarded after use.</li>
<li><strong>Breaking Out of Mental Frameworks</strong>: Escaping inherent societal beliefs like &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t have food if you don&rsquo;t work hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;investing is wrong&rdquo; is harder than making the right investment itself. One must resist the negative influence of friends and family and stick to one&rsquo;s own path.</li>
<li><strong>True Freedom</strong>: Financial freedom is just the first step. True freedom is the ability to ignore the judgment of society and others, to grade yourself, and to live the life you want. You decide how you want to spend your money and what kind of life you want to liveâ€”that is freedom.</li>
<li><strong>Warning of Survivorship Bias</strong>: The teacher admits that his ability to make money in his first 20 years of speculation was due to &ldquo;heaven&rsquo;s mercy&rdquo; and &ldquo;luck,&rdquo; a case of survivorship bias that is not replicable. He strongly advises against imitating it.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalism and Inequality</strong>: The development of civilization has created information gaps, which are the root of inequality. Capitalism uses information asymmetry to create unfairness, which is essentially plunder. The teacher compares human conflicts to &ldquo;watching two groups of gorillas fighting,&rdquo; illustrating that human civilization has not progressed much in its essence; slavery exists today in a new form and on a larger scale.</li>
<li><strong>A Revolution to Eliminate Poverty</strong>: Teacher James sees his educational sharing as a &ldquo;revolution to eliminate poverty,&rdquo; aimed at awakening the masses to understand the rules of capitalism and transform from exploited &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; to &ldquo;masters&rdquo; who use the rules to their advantage.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation Principles</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Condition for Retirement: Assets reach 50 times annual expenses.</li>
<li>Retirement Allocation: Cash should be at least 30%, enough to cover more than 15 years of annual expenses.</li>
<li>Beta Value: The Beta of the initial allocation should not exceed 1.0.</li>
<li>Leveraged Funds: The position in leveraged funds should not exceed the cash position, nor should it exceed the position in the underlying fund.</li>
<li>Flexible Allocation: Besides the 4-3-3 model, configurations like 70/30, 60/40, and 50/50 are all viable. The key is to find what suits your own risk tolerance and cash flow needs.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>No Shortcuts in Investment Learning</strong>: Investment knowledge requires systematic learning and cannot be achieved overnight. You must connect the scattered &ldquo;dots&rdquo; of knowledge into &ldquo;lines,&rdquo; which then form a &ldquo;surface&rdquo; and a &ldquo;three-dimensional&rdquo; knowledge system through continuous watching of videos (e.g., starting from #398) and note-taking.</li>

<li><strong>Extreme Optimism About the Future of AI</strong>: The teacher believes we are in a golden age.

<li><strong>The Revolutionary Nature of Agents</strong>: Taking OpenAI&rsquo;s Agent functionality as an example, future AI agents will be able to automatically complete complex tasks like booking tickets, shopping, and planning itineraries. This will disrupt many industries and create entirely new business models and corporate giants.</li>
<li><strong>Expectation of Returns</strong>: Based on this, the teacher believes that the 18% annualized return of the past 20 years may be an underestimation. In the future, 25% or even higher is possible, and it&rsquo;s not out of the question for the market to grow 100-fold in the next 20 years.</li>

<li><strong>Share</strong>: After attending the class in January 2024, I transferred my entire 401k to a brokerage account and invested it all at once. The market was down at the time, and my assets grew from $1.1 million to the current $1.7 million. My current asset allocation is 50% QQQ, 20% TQQQ.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: When I retire, should I convert the TQQQ to QQQ?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The focus isn&rsquo;t on TQQQ. The goal is to get your brokerage account funds to exceed $1 million so you can do stock pledges in the future. Your current tax rate is between 30-33%, so you should immediately start converting funds from your Traditional 401k/IRA to a Roth IRA in batches. Since your assets will be much higher in the future, a one-time conversion would face an extremely high tax bill. It&rsquo;s recommended to convert a portion each year, for example, $100,000 at a time (Note: a student pointed out that at a 30% tax rate, converting $100k would cost $30k in taxes, so be prepared). Strategically, you should place leveraged funds (like TQQQ) in the tax-free Roth account, while leaving cash in the Traditional account to slow its growth.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: After a promotion, I have to manage more people, and the pressure has skyrocketed, making me anxious, irritable, and even affecting my interactions with my family. How did you cope with high-pressure management positions back then?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The higher your position, the more relaxed you should be. If you&rsquo;re more tired, it means your management skills are lacking. The key is to learn to delegate and &ldquo;throw the monkeys,&rdquo; meaning you assign tasks to your subordinates to complete, and you only check and guide at critical points. Don&rsquo;t take the pressure from your superiors seriously; treat it as &ldquo;wind in your ears&rdquo; or a &ldquo;dog barking at a train.&rdquo; Your core job is to enhance your subordinates&rsquo; abilities and make them stronger than you, so you can truly &ldquo;work while lying down.&rdquo; When your boss scolds you, take a deep breath; that&rsquo;s his problem, don&rsquo;t let it affect your mood.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: Can the CT scan you mentioned also detect problems with other organs like the pancreas?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: LDCT mainly targets the lungs. While it can also scan the liver, its effectiveness for pancreatic cancer screening is uncertain. For a full-body cancer cell screening, you need a PET Scan, but it has high radiation and is usually only for diagnosed cancer patients to check for metastasis.

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: In the smart rebalancing strategy, do you ever rebalance the underlying fund (like QQQ)?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Yes, the underlying fund is never touched.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: If the market crashes and then rebounds, and the leveraged fund (like TQQQ) rises for the year but its total asset percentage has not returned to the initially set ratio (e.g., target 30%, now up from 20% to 28%), do I still need to sell one-third of the gains?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: You must sell. If you don&rsquo;t take out cash in a rising year and keep using cash to buy in a falling year, your cash reserves will be depleted quickly. Even if the leveraged fund hasn&rsquo;t returned to its previous high, as long as it has risen for the year, you must take out a portion of the profit (one-third of the gain) to replenish your cash. This is a critical risk control mechanism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: Besides living expenses, buying dips, and margin for pledges, does cash have other uses? I feel like a 30% cash allocation might be too high for me.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: 30% cash corresponds to 15 years of living expenses (calculated at a 2% annual withdrawal rate), which is a robust initial setting. If your pledged loans increase, your cash reserves need to increase accordingly to cover the debt risk. If you have other stable income (like social security, rent), you can continue to invest that income instead of reducing your cash reserve. Maintaining a 15-year cash reserve is a simple and effective strategy.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: I read Professor Chou&rsquo;s book, which mentioned not recommending long-term holding of leveraged ETFs because their value erodes over time and the long-term return is not double. This differs from your view. How should I understand this?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The annualized return of a leveraged fund is indeed not a linear double (e.g., if QQQ has a 10% annualized return, TQQQ might only be 14%), but due to the compounding effect, the total asset growth multiplier after 20 years will be far more than double. The reason Professor Chou doesn&rsquo;t recommend it is that he is addressing the general public and cannot teach complex asset allocation in depth. Holding leveraged funds is indeed very dangerous without asset allocation (i.e., without cash to buy on dips). Our method is built on strict asset allocation, which is the fundamental difference. These things can only be taught in a small, in-depth learning class; if you say this in the mass media, you&rsquo;ll be &ldquo;drowned in saliva.&rdquo;</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: The market is hitting new highs, and I have the impulse to sell some of my QLD to lock in profits and increase cash. Should I do it now or wait until the end of the year?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Wait until the end of the year. The market&rsquo;s gain so far this year is not that large (about 10%). A normal bull year should see a rise of 30% or more. Only when there is a huge deviation (like a 50% annual gain) is there a need to consider adjusting early. Otherwise, just rebalance annually.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Share &amp; Question 2</strong>: I shared a strategy from a research paper, which is to sell leveraged funds when the index falls below the 200-day moving average (MA200) and buy back when it rises above it, claiming it can significantly improve returns. I did my own simulation and it seemed to work well. I&rsquo;d like to hear your thoughts.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This kind of market-timing strategy is useless. First, you&rsquo;ll encounter many &ldquo;whipsaws&rdquo; (false breakouts), leading to losses from selling high and buying low. Second, even if you successfully sell at the top (like in 2000), the biggest problem is when to buy back; human nature makes it very difficult. This operation seems clever, but its actual effect is often worse than the simple and effective &ldquo;hold and buy the dip&rdquo; strategy. We rely on asset allocation and cash reserves, not market timing.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: I have two children (one in college, one just started working), and they each have over 5 million TWD in assets. Should they invest directly in an underlying fund (00662) or use a 4-3-3 allocation?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: You must allocate cash for them. They are about to become independent and need their own emergency fund. You can&rsquo;t let them rely on their parents for everything. I suggest starting with an 80/20 (underlying/cash) allocation and don&rsquo;t use leveraged funds yet. Once they get used to investing, you can slowly add a small amount of leverage in the future. Don&rsquo;t let them experience large fluctuations from the start, as it might leave them with psychological scars.</li>

<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: It seems that Taiwan&rsquo;s leveraged fund (00670L) recovers slower than America&rsquo;s QLD. Is there a problem with its management?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is mainly due to the TWD exchange rate and hedging costs. The correct comparison is between 00670L and 00662, as they are both priced in TWD. Historical data shows that the return of 00670L is more than double that of 00662, proving it has met its design objective.</li>

Don&rsquo;t worry about how much you&rsquo;ve lost, because you still have decades of investing time ahead of you. Even if you only get a small amount back, investing it in an index fund will grow into a huge fortune after 40 years, far exceeding your current losses.</li>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: You used to work at Acer and were also a &ldquo;slave&rdquo; to capitalists. How did you adjust your mindset back then, having to work for capitalists while maintaining a sense of accomplishment?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: I started investing in my second year of work, so I was both a laborer and a capitalist. The key is that you must find a meaning and mission for your work that goes beyond the salary. My mission at that time was to design stable and reliable computers to serve the public.

Asset allocation requires understanding your entire situation: age, family status (single/married/children), total annual expenses, whether you have a sufficient emergency fund, and whether this 200,000 is spare money. Without this information, it&rsquo;s impossible to give responsible advice. If this 200,000 is money you won&rsquo;t touch for 15-20 years and you already have an adequate emergency fund, then you can buy QQQ or 00662 all at once.</li>

<p>This session begins with an important reminder about health management, emphasizing the &ldquo;health first&rdquo; philosophy. The core content revolves around the &ldquo;mindset awakening&rdquo; of investors. Teacher James profoundly analyzes the difference in mentality between a &ldquo;slave&rdquo; and a &ldquo;master&rdquo; within the capitalist system, encouraging students to become masters of capital by investing in index funds long-term and breaking free from the shackles of working for money. At the same time, he teaches everyone to ignore external judgments and pursue genuine, heartfelt freedom and happiness. The Q&amp;A session was rich in content, covering various aspects from retirement asset allocation, use of leveraged funds, and tax planning to professional mindset adjustment, providing extremely valuable practical guidance for investors at different stages.</p>

Teacher James emphasizes that investors should ignore market noise and short-term fluctuations, adhering to a strategy of &ldquo;buy, hold, and never sell.&rdquo; Successful investing requires not only the right asset allocation (especially using cash to build an &ldquo;anti-fragile&rdquo; portfolio) but also a strong psychological constitution, including steadfastness, patience, and faith, to ultimately achieve financial freedom and inner peace.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore Market Noise</strong>: Teacher James points out that in his 40 years of investing, almost all financial and political news and market analysis have been &ldquo;demons and monsters,&rdquo; useless for long-term investing. He quotes a student&rsquo;s message, emphasizing that social opinions and market volatility are irrelevant to long-term investors; enjoying the tranquility of the present is far more important than focusing on fleeting issues.</li>
<li><strong>The Best Strategy: Buy, Hold, Don&rsquo;t Sell</strong>: This is the core principle throughout. The art of investing lies not in complex market timing or stock picking, but in persistently holding high-quality assets for a lifetime, or even for generations.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Should Be Easy and Simple</strong>: The teacher uses an analogy: investing should only take 5-10 minutes a year and should not be a burden on one&rsquo;s life. If you make investing complicated, it&rsquo;s like adding a lot of chili oil to a simple clear noodle soup, which ruins the original flavor. Investors should spend more time enjoying life and being with their families.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Spicy Beef Noodle&rdquo; Theory</strong>: When asked about asset allocation ratios, the teacher uses a vivid example. He believes that asking someone else how to allocate your assets is like asking them how much chili to add to your beef noodles because everyone&rsquo;s risk tolerance (how much spice they can handle) is different.
<ul>
<li><strong>Advice for Beginners</strong>: For novices or those unsure of their risk tolerance, the teacher suggests starting with &ldquo;clear-broth beef noodles&rdquo; (a conservative allocation), for example, 50% of assets in the market and 50% in cash.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy for Large Sums of Capital</strong>: It is recommended to divide it into three parts: buy 1/3 immediately, buy 1/3 in batches, and keep 1/3 as cash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Three Elements of Investment Psychology: Steadfastness, Patience, Faith</strong>: Once you have bought in, the next step is to cultivate a strong psychological mindset.
<ul>
<li><strong>Steadfastness</strong>: Not being affected by market fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Patience</strong>: Enduring painful periods of market decline is a necessary psychological quality.</li>
<li><strong>Faith</strong>: Believing in the long-term upward trend of the market is the path to reaching the highest realm of investing.</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash and Market Volatility are &ldquo;Boosters&rdquo; for Assets</strong>: The teacher uses the concept of a &ldquo;boost converter&rdquo; in electronic circuits as an analogy. Market volatility is like an &ldquo;oscillator,&rdquo; and cash is like the &ldquo;electric current.&rdquo; Investing cash during a market downturn (oscillation) can effectively push asset values to new highs.</li>
<li><strong>Fragile vs. Anti-fragile</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Fragile Investment</strong>: For example, investing 100% in QQQ. If the market goes to zero, your assets go to zero. This is like a flower in a greenhouse that cannot withstand a storm.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-fragile Investment</strong>: For example, holding an index fund while keeping 30% in cash. Even if the market goes to zero, you still have 30% of your assets. This is like wildflowers everywhere, tenacious and able to survive and even thrive in harsh environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>An Anti-fragile Life</strong>: This concept applies not only to investing but also to life. For example, an employee who serves only one company is fragile and can be laid off at any time; whereas an Uber driver is anti-fragile, earning income as long as they drive. In the AI era, a pure software engineer becomes fragile, while experts in various industries who know how to use AI become anti-fragile.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mathematical Explanation of Volatility Decay</strong>: The teacher reveals the characteristic of volatility decay in leveraged ETFs through calculation.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Assume QQQ falls for 45 consecutive days (-1% each day) and then rises for 46 consecutive days (+1% each day), it will eventually hit a new high.</li>
<li><strong>Comparison</strong>: Under the same conditions, if TQQQ falls for 45 consecutive days (-3% each day) and then rises for 46 consecutive days (+3% each day), its final price will still be below the initial starting point, unable to recover its losses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Who is Not Suitable for Leveraged Funds</strong>: Investors who are afraid of downturns and cannot withstand huge volatility should stay away from leveraged funds.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Use of Leveraged Funds</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Position Size Cannot Be Too Large</strong>: Investing a large sum of money into a high proportion of leveraged funds at once is very dangerous. In a long bear market, it could lead to assets going to zero with no chance of recovery.</li>
<li><strong>Suitable for Dollar-Cost Averaging</strong>: For investors with a continuous cash flow (like a monthly salary), making small, regular investments over decades is feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Warning</strong>: For retirees, a high leverage position could send you back to the workforce; for those currently employed, it could postpone your retirement plans indefinitely.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Live in the Present, Eliminate Worry</strong>: The teacher guides everyone to ponder a question: &ldquo;If tomorrow were the end of your life, could you depart with a smile?&rdquo; He believes that true happiness comes from &ldquo;dying without regrets.&rdquo; If you have regrets in life, you should remedy them now, not spend your days worrying.</li>
<li><strong>Happiness is a Human Right</strong>: Investing should be joyful. If it causes you pain, don&rsquo;t participate. The value of life is not in its length, but in its depth and brightness.</li>

<ol>
<li>A new member from last week, he is very grateful to Teacher James for his quick email response, which solved his problem with the app&rsquo;s operation.</li>
<li>He combines his insights from reading with the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy to create daily reminders for his investment principles: have capital, an investment philosophy, discipline, patience, and luck, combined with the teacher&rsquo;s &ldquo;hear, know, understand, believe, execute, firmly believe.&rdquo;</li>
<li>He quotes a conversation between Warren Buffett and Bill Gates to emphasize the principle of &ldquo;getting rich slowly,&rdquo; believing that patience is the most difficult but most crucial part of investing.</li>
<li>He shares his past principles for selling individual stocks (the reason for buying disappears, the target price is reached, the company faces irreversible difficulties), but now he has found a better option (QQQ) and is liquidating his individual stocks.</li>
<li>Regarding real estate, he believes that a house is also a financial product and proposes a view: &ldquo;Houses aren&rsquo;t bought by people, they&rsquo;re bought by money,&rdquo; with its price driven by market liquidity. He thinks the reason real estate returns are sometimes very high is due to high leverage (e.g., 5x or even 10x). His family owns a jewelry store, and he suggests that high-net-worth individuals can allocate a small amount to gold as a hedge against extreme risks.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Question: The &ldquo;Nine Scenarios&rdquo; PDF file he downloaded shows overlapping text and numbers on his phone. He asks if he can get the link again.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is likely a display issue with his personal phone, as there is no problem with the link itself. He suggests trying to open it on a computer or asking family or friends for help.</li>

<li>Sharing: He found that in the Chinese market, the management fee for the Harvest Nasdaq ETF (159501) is 0.2% lower than the 513100 recommended by the teacher, believing it will make a difference in long-term returns.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: The market is very efficient; this small fee difference is unlikely to bring extra profit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: How to change his parents&rsquo; investment mindset? He details the painful experience of his father suffering severe losses due to high-risk investments and being deceived by relatives. This has led his parents to be extremely risk-averse, preferring to deposit tens of millions of RMB in a bank for a fixed term (with an annual interest rate of only about 1.5%) and refusing to touch any funds. They even believe that real estate is the most secure asset. He feels confused and doesn&rsquo;t know if he should continue to persuade them.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t try to change them. Everyone&rsquo;s &ldquo;psychology of money&rdquo; is shaped by their life experiences. His parents&rsquo; views are &ldquo;correct&rdquo; in their world, a way to protect themselves from further harm. What you should do is manage your own money, invest your own funds, and become a big tree yourself. When you become very wealthy, your parents might see it, but changing them is not your responsibility. The most important thing is to let them live a peaceful and happy life.</li>

<li>She believes investors should first have an attitude of self-responsibility instead of just seeking answers from the teacher. She spent over a year studying the teacher&rsquo;s courses very seriously, treating investing like a startup project, so her mindset is very stable.</li>
<li>She suggests new students (like Zhang Le) need to give themselves and their investment strategy some time, using three or four years of results to prove it to their parents, rather than trying to convince their family as soon as they start.</li>
<li>She has observed that the teacher is constantly changing and growing, giving different advice based on different students&rsquo; situations, such as once advising Taiwanese investors who needed stable cash flow to allocate a portion to high-dividend ETFs.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: He is in a good mood; his low tone of voice is because he is very calm inside, which is a very good state. He will not be influenced by the outside world and uses a joke about &ldquo;not wrestling with a pig&rdquo; to illustrate that for people who cannot understand, there is no need to argue, just say &ldquo;you are right.&rdquo; He emphasizes that he is growing and changing every day; otherwise, he would be stagnant.</li>

<li>Sharing: He reflected on the teacher&rsquo;s teachings, shifting his understanding from &ldquo;cash is risk&rdquo; to &ldquo;cash is life-saving money.&rdquo; He believes that besides pursuing assets, one should also explore inner needs.</li>
<li>Question: Besides external assets, what should one pursue internally in life? Is there a &ldquo;Perfect Way&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Pursue inner peace (&ldquo;Where my heart is at peace, that is my home&rdquo;). When a person sees through many things and their heart is not troubled by any person or event, they will reach a very peaceful state. This requires nurturing one&rsquo;s spirituality, learning to &ldquo;separate&rdquo; from certain things, and taking back control of one&rsquo;s life, daring to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to things you don&rsquo;t want.</li>

<li>Sharing: He used to be confused about concepts like pledge, line of credit, and margin, always thinking they were just &ldquo;borrowing money.&rdquo; After listening to the teacher&rsquo;s explanation, he understood that the risks of different borrowing methods are vastly different, especially the difference between a line of credit and a stock pledge. He has already applied for a line of credit and paid off his previous pledge, feeling a sense of clarity.

<li>Question: Specific operational questions about stock pledges, such as how the interest rate is calculated, which account&rsquo;s assets it&rsquo;s based on, and whether the interest needs to be paid manually.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: These questions have been explained in detail in his previous videos and Excel sheets. The interest will automatically roll into the principal and does not need to be repaid manually. The interest rate depends on the asset size of the pledged account and the total assets of the entire household account. He advises Niu Fang to watch the series of videos specifically explaining stock pledges (especially episodes 004, 005), as it&rsquo;s difficult to fully understand just through Q&amp;A.</li>

<li>When borrowing money, should he borrow a year&rsquo;s worth at once, or borrow monthly/as needed?</li>
<li>During a ROTH conversion, can he transfer stocks (in-kind) directly from a traditional IRA to a brokerage account, instead of selling and then transferring?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Keeping an extra 10% in cash is of course safer.</li>
<li>The remaining money can continue to be invested according to the 4-3-3 ratio.</li>
<li>Borrow as needed. For example, borrow only when you need to pay a bill this week; don&rsquo;t borrow in advance and let it sit.</li>

<li>Having followed the teacher for nearly 6 years, financial freedom has given him time for philanthropy, such as teaching indigenous communities. He noticed an interesting phenomenon: people are afraid of their health indexes (like blood sugar) going up, but they hope their wealth index (QQQ) goes up every day.</li>
<li>He mentioned hearing Howard Marks quote Warren Buffett on the &ldquo;Macro Insights&rdquo; program and then add: &ldquo;You never bet against the United States, and you never bet against China.&rdquo; He wanted to hear the teacher&rsquo;s opinion.</li>
<li>He observed the tech talent war between the US and China. Regardless of where the talent flows, it ultimately converges in the tech giants, which is a long-term positive for QQQ.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: What Howard Marks means is that the first choice for investment is still the US, but you shouldn&rsquo;t be bearish on China either, because its potential is huge. Therefore, you can choose not to be &ldquo;long&rdquo; China, but you should never &ldquo;short&rdquo; China. The focus of investment should remain on the United States.</li>

<li>She uses one of her accounts as an example: it suffered severe losses during the big drop in April, but after she decisively rebalanced her portfolio, the account&rsquo;s return reached 75% within 3 months, not only recovering all losses but also earning over $50,000.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>All information is a demon or a monster; in 40 years, no information has ever been useful.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view emphasizes the importance of ignoring short-term market noise and sticking to a long-term investment strategy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asking me how to do your asset allocation is like asking me how much chili to add to your beef noodles.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view vividly illustrates the personalized nature of asset allocation. Everyone&rsquo;s risk tolerance is different, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What our asset allocation needs to achieve is a state of &ldquo;anti-fragility.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view introduces the core concept of &ldquo;anti-fragility,&rdquo; which is to build an investment portfolio that can survive and retain strength even in extreme risk scenarios (like the market going to zero).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to raise a child than to maintain a house.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view reflects on the phenomenon in modern society where people sacrifice their quality of life, and even the desire to have children, for the sake of real estate, emphasizing the importance of life&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He who can buy is a grandson, he who can sell is a father, but he who never sells is a god.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view uses a colloquial analogy to highly praise the ultimate state of investing: &ldquo;hold for the long term, never sell.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Houses aren&rsquo;t bought by people, they&rsquo;re bought by money.
&ndash; Bruce</p></blockquote>
<p>This view points out the essence of the real estate market, whose price fluctuations are primarily driven by monetary liquidity rather than just the housing needs of the population.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t even manage the little bit of money in your hands, then don&rsquo;t go selling your house, and don&rsquo;t go taking out loans.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view advises investors to proceed step by step, starting with small amounts of capital and proving their ability to manage investments well before considering the use of larger-scale funds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investing can cultivate the mind.
&ndash; Jimmy</p></blockquote>
<p>This view highlights another dimension of investing: through the process of managing wealth and dealing with market fluctuations, investors can cultivate their character and achieve inner peace.</p>

<p>This session lucidly explains Teacher James&rsquo;s core investment philosophy and life wisdom. Starting from the simple principle of &ldquo;buy, hold, don&rsquo;t sell,&rdquo; it extends to the sophisticated strategy of using cash to build an &ldquo;anti-fragile&rdquo; portfolio, and then to a profound analysis of the risks of leveraged ETFs, providing investors with a clear guide to action. More importantly, the class transcends purely financial discussion, closely linking investment with personal psychological growth, family happiness, and inner peace. Through vivid analogies and real student cases, the teacher guides everyone to realize that true financial freedom is not just about numerical growth, but about breaking free from fear and anxiety, gaining the ability to control one&rsquo;s life and enjoy the present moment. At the same time, the teacher also reminds students that investment philosophy is constantly evolving and growing, requiring continuous learning and follow-up, otherwise, one becomes like a &ldquo;lost lamb,&rdquo; disconnected from the latest understanding.</p>

<p>The core message of this session is that ordinary investors should adopt a minimalist yet highly effective investment strategy: <strong>long-term holding of the Nasdaq-100 index fund (QQQ) and using asset-backed loans to cover living expenses. This allows them to enjoy the compound growth of their assets while legally avoiding capital gains tax and income tax.</strong> Through data and examples, James contrasts the inevitable losses of short-term traders with the steady wealth accumulation of long-term investors, emphasizing that &ldquo;Persistence, Patience, and Faith&rdquo; are the only things that matter in investing.</p>

<li><strong>Follow Multiple Platforms</strong>: Given the ever-changing social media landscape, it is recommended to follow CLEC on multiple platforms (e.g., YouTube, Clubhouse, Facebook) to avoid losing contact.</li>
<li><strong>The Market Always Reaches New Highs</strong>: For long-term investors, there is no &ldquo;highest point&rdquo; for the market, only &ldquo;higher.&rdquo; Buying at any time is a low point from a long-term perspective. The peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 now seems like an extremely low price.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Risk and Asset Allocation</strong>: Investing involves risk; the market could drop by 50%-70%. The best way to manage risk is not through frequent trading but by proper asset allocation and holding enough cash to withstand market volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Our Investment Choice</strong>: We focus solely on investing in the Nasdaq-100 index fund (QQQ). Page 11 of the course notes lists corresponding funds in various countries. Please do not ask about other complex funds; simplifying your investment is key.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Requires Extreme Optimism</strong>: You must firmly believe that the market will eventually go up, always looking on the bright side. Wealth is worth waiting for; investing requires patience.</li>

<li><strong>Second Exploitation</strong>: You invest the after-tax money ($600,000), and any profits are then hit with capital gains tax (e.g., 25%).</li>

<li><strong>Admit Ignorance, Embrace the Index</strong>: If you don&rsquo;t have Warren Buffett&rsquo;s stock-picking ability, you should acknowledge your limitations. Long-term investment in an index fund is the wisest choice.</li>
<li><strong>The Most Important Thing in Investing</strong>: Adhere to these three things: &ldquo;<strong>Persistence, Patience, and Faith</strong>.&rdquo; Everything else (how to buy, how to sell) is unimportant. We only teach how to buy, not how to sell.</li>
<li><strong>Knowing When to Stop Brings Stability</strong>: Quoting a share from student Barin, James emphasizes the importance of &ldquo;knowing when to stop.&rdquo; This is a form of self-restraint after reflection, knowing when to apply the brakes between greed and fear and avoiding maxing out leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Getting Rich Once is Enough</strong>: One only needs to get rich slowly once in a lifetime. True wealth is not about how much money you have, but about living with ease and not being constrained by money. A higher realm is to help others achieve wealth together.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to Spend Money Smartly</strong>: The best state in life is to be <strong>&ldquo;in heaven, with money in the bank&rdquo;</strong> (meaning your money runs out just as you pass away). Young people don&rsquo;t need to invest every penny; they can plan their retirement goals and enjoy life appropriately, making their youth more meaningful.</li>
<li><strong>Investing is Like Riding a Cable Car</strong>: The growth of our assets is like riding a cable car. Although there are bumps and shakes along the way, the overall trend is upward. We just need to sit tight, enjoy the scenery, and live our lives.</li>

<li>Question: My sister is very insistent on investing in an individual stock, TSMC, instead of an index fund. How should I communicate with her?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: The biggest problem with individual stocks is not performance, but that <strong>you never know when to sell</strong> and <strong>you cannot effectively pass it down through generations</strong>. You can&rsquo;t teach your children when to sell TSMC; they might panic and sell at a low point. In contrast, the strategy for index funds (hold long-term, never sell) is simple, clear, and easy to pass on. Even Warren Buffett advised his family to invest in the SPY index fund after his death because his stock-picking ability cannot be inherited.</li>

<li>Question: I run a small business in Taiwan, pay a lot in taxes, and the work is very hard. I want to retire and put all my assets into 00662, but I&rsquo;m afraid of feeling insecure without cash flow. What should I do?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: First, you need to calculate your business&rsquo;s <strong>net profit margin</strong>. If your net profit margin isn&rsquo;t significantly higher than QQQ&rsquo;s annualized return (around 18%, say, less than 30%), then continuing the business doesn&rsquo;t make much sense, as you&rsquo;re taking on huge risks and hardship for a lower return. Regarding the cash flow issue, you can solve it with <strong>asset allocation</strong>: hold 30% of your total assets (or enough to cover 15 years of living expenses) in cash or cash equivalents (like 00865B), and invest the remaining 70% in 00662. This way, you&rsquo;ll have enough cash to live on, while the stock portion continues to grow. In the long run, you won&rsquo;t run out of assets.</li>

<li>Question: My son is 30. He can contribute $7,000 to a Roth IRA and $23,000 to a SEP IRA. How should he allocate this?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>I strongly recommend avoiding any Traditional (pre-tax) accounts</strong>. The tax you save now will be paid back at a higher rate in the future. First, you should find a brokerage that offers a <strong>Roth SEP IRA</strong>. If you can&rsquo;t find one, then <strong>do not contribute to the SEP IRA</strong>. It&rsquo;s better to put the money in a regular Brokerage Account. Assets in a brokerage account are never taxed until they are sold, whereas money in a Traditional account is subject to Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) and taxes after age 75. As for allocation, all Roth accounts can buy QQQ. For the Roth IRA, given its small amount and long-term dollar-cost averaging nature, you could consider the more aggressive <strong>TQQQ</strong>.</li>

<li>Question 1: An investment scenario: A brother invests 10 million and withdraws 200,000 annually. The market then drops 50%, leaving his assets at 5.8 million. At this point, his younger brother invests 5.8 million with the same allocation. Can the younger brother also withdraw 200,000 annually?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>Yes</strong>. Because the younger brother entered the market after a major crash when the risk was lower, he is &ldquo;luckier.&rdquo; The older brother initially used a low 2% withdrawal rate precisely to create a buffer for such a crash. After the risk event has occurred, the younger brother&rsquo;s withdrawal rate, although seemingly higher (about 3.45%), is based on a different risk foundation, so it is feasible.</li>
</ul>

<li>Question 2: The Taiwan dollar has appreciated, making it seem like 00662 hasn&rsquo;t recovered to its previous high. Can I, for psychological purposes, add back the currency loss and consider it to have broken even?

<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: If you&rsquo;re just doing it for &ldquo;fun&rdquo; and are willing to pay the &ldquo;ticket price&rdquo; (i.e., giving up the massive potential returns from long-term holding of QQQ), then of course you can. But this is just making small money while giving up the opportunity to make big money.

When taking out the loan, you should choose a long enough term to ensure that the monthly payment plus living expenses is less than your monthly income.

<p>We borrow money to spend without paying taxes, and our money in the stock market assets grows forever, always up, how great is that! This is the best thing in the world.

<p>This quote brilliantly summarizes the core advantage of using asset-backed loans for consumption: achieving tax exemption for spending while enjoying the compound growth of assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We only need to get rich once in our lifetime. We don&rsquo;t need to be rich from the start; just get rich slowly.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This sentence conveys the patience and calm mindset of long-term investing, opposing the speculative psychology of rushing for success and emphasizing that wealth accumulation is a continuous and steady process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The highest skill in investing is to exist in a state of &rsquo;non-eventfulness,&rsquo; where the market basically doesn&rsquo;t exist&hellip; The market&rsquo;s ups and downs have nothing to do with us.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This describes the ultimate psychological state a long-term investor should aspire to: being completely unaffected by short-term market fluctuations because their investment strategy is independent of short-term movements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you look at anything from a long-term perspective, you will see it clearly.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>In answering how to see the essence of things, James emphasizes the importance of the time dimension. A decision may seem reasonable in the present, but when viewed over a span of decades, the conclusion might be completely different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can make 20 billion from short-term trading, can you really get that 20 billion? If you have 1 million now and you can&rsquo;t get 20 billion in 60 years, then don&rsquo;t do it, you&rsquo;re wasting your time. Because you can have 20 billion by doing nothing.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>When discussing short-term trading with a student, James uses a high-impact numerical comparison to reveal the enormous opportunity cost difference between short-term trading and long-term index holding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned one sentence now, which is, &lsquo;I might be wrong&rsquo;&hellip; Only when we acknowledge our ignorance do we begin to learn.

<p>This session was an intensive training in mindset and strategy. James once again emphasized the overwhelming advantage of the core strategy of long-term holding of index funds (QQQ) and used detailed data to reveal the inevitable failure of short-term trading. The highlight of this session was the clear explanation of the &ldquo;wealthy&rsquo;s tax strategy&rdquo;â€”asset-backed loansâ€”providing investors with a path to achieve both wealth growth and tax optimization. The entire session was imbued with the investment philosophy of &ldquo;Persistence, Patience, and Faith,&rdquo; and through interactive Q&amp;A with numerous students, it addressed a series of specific issues from asset allocation, retirement planning, and children&rsquo;s education to international tax matters, vividly demonstrating how to integrate investment wisdom into real-life decision-making.</p>

<p>The core theme of this session is to emphasize that long-term investors should ignore short-term market volatility and firmly believe in the market&rsquo;s perpetual upward trend. Teacher James points out that having funds out of the market is the biggest risk, and investors should enter the market as soon as possible, adopting a &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, and never sell&rdquo; strategy. By debunking common market prediction indicators (like the Buffett Indicator) and analyzing asset allocation, he aims to help investors build a solid investment mindset to achieve long-term wealth growth.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market Volatility Doesn&rsquo;t Concern Me</strong>: For long-term investors, daily market fluctuations, global situations, tariff wars, etc., should not influence investment decisions. The market hitting new highs for three consecutive days proves the importance of staying in the market.</li>
<li><strong>Being Out of the Market is the Biggest Risk</strong>: Many people exit the market fearing a downturn, but waiting for a correction might mean never getting back in. Keeping funds out of the market and missing out on gains is a far greater risk than a short-term decline.</li>
<li><strong>Predictions are Useless, Making Money is What Matters</strong>: There are many who make correct market predictions, but the ones who actually make money are those who ignore the predictions and stay invested.</li>
<li><strong>The Market Always Goes Up</strong>: This is the core belief a long-term investor must have. Historical data proves that in the long run, the market only goes up and will always reach new highs. Investors should always be extremely optimistic and face the sun.</li>
<li><strong>Review the Past, Preview the Future</strong>: The teacher advises students, especially new ones, to watch videos from the market crashes at the end of 2018, March 2020, and in 2022 to learn how to react correctly during times of panic and to mentally prepare for future market volatility.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Risk in Long-Term Investing</strong>: Looking at a century of history, buying at any point and holding for the long term has always been profitable. However, short-term volatility can be immense, with potential drops of 50% or even 80%, so one must focus on long-term returns.</li>
<li><strong>The Nature of Your Funds Dictates Your Investment</strong>: Money needed for the short term (like tuition or a down payment for a house) must absolutely not be invested in the stock market; it should be kept as cash. Only long-term funds that you won&rsquo;t touch for 10-20 years are suitable for investment.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Asset Allocation</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Seek Stability Before Returns</strong>: Investment allocation should prioritize psychological stability. It is inadvisable for people to switch from an aggressive allocation (e.g., 442) to a conservative one (e.g., 433) when they can&rsquo;t handle the pressure during a market drop (like in April of this year).</li>
<li><strong>A Conservative Beta Value</strong>: It is recommended that an investor&rsquo;s Beta value not exceed 1.0. If you think you can handle 1.0, it&rsquo;s better to subtract 0.2 and adopt a Beta of 0.8, which might be more suitable.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Sufficient Cash</strong>: It&rsquo;s advisable to keep at least 30% in cash. For example, a portfolio of 70% QQQ + 30% Cash.</li>
<li><strong>Gradual Increase in Leverage</strong>: Newcomers to the market can start without using leveraged funds. During a market dip, you can use a small amount of cash (e.g., 2% of assets) to buy a 2x leveraged fund, thereby gradually building a leveraged position and allowing the Beta value to increase naturally as the market rises. This is like riding a smooth, high-class train rather than a bumpy race car.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Case: Currency Exchange Impact on 00662 vs. QLD</strong>
<ul>
<li>A student asked if the performance of 00662 (Fubon NASDAQ-100) lagged behind QLD due to the appreciation of the Taiwan Dollar (TWD).</li>
<li><strong>Teacher&rsquo;s Analysis</strong>: Comparisons must be made in the same currency. Assuming the exchange rate was 33 when investing in QQQ and is now 29, the exchange loss is 12%. Over the past 5 years, QLD&rsquo;s performance was about 128%, and 00662&rsquo;s was about 114%. However, after deducting the 12% currency exchange loss from QLD&rsquo;s 128%, its performance becomes about 112%, which is actually lower than 00662&rsquo;s 114%. The conclusion is that their performances are essentially the same; don&rsquo;t be misled by nominal figures in different currencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Debunking the &ldquo;Buffett Indicator&rdquo; Myth</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Many people use the &ldquo;Total Stock Market Capitalization / GDP&rdquo; ratio to judge if the market is overheated, which is wrong.</li>
<li><strong>GDP is a flow concept</strong>: It only measures the new value added in the current year.</li>
<li><strong>Market Cap is a stock concept</strong>: It includes the value of all of a company&rsquo;s historical investments and accumulated value.</li>
<li>Comparing a changing flow metric to a cumulative stock metric is like comparing apples and oranges; it&rsquo;s completely illogical.</li>
<li>Warren Buffett himself rarely mentions this indicator and emphasizes not to use a single indicator to judge the market. Many &ldquo;pundits&rdquo; and bloggers on the market abuse this concept just to get attention, like mindless &ldquo;parrots.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Beware of Investment Scams</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Teacher James <strong>solemnly declares</strong> that he provides <strong>completely free</strong> and <strong>voluntary teaching</strong>. He will never contact students privately, let alone offer financial services for a 1% fee or any other charge.</li>
<li>Anyone who uses his name on platforms like LINE or WeChat to contact you, claiming they can manage your finances for a fee, is a <strong>scammer</strong>.</li>
<li>In the US, it is illegal for an uncertified financial advisor to charge fees. The teacher stresses that no one cares more about your assets than you do; you must manage your investments yourself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Awakening to Capitalism</strong>: Teacher James puts forward a sharp point: laborers who go to work in modern society are, in essence, &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; of capitalism. The purpose of his teaching is to awaken everyone&rsquo;s &ldquo;capitalist consciousness,&rdquo; to learn to use capitalism to become capitalists, rather than being enslaved by it. (Refer to video <code>00315</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Ultimate Goals in Life</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Health and Longevity are Fundamental</strong>: Longevity is the path to wealth, and health is the mother of happiness. He reminds everyone to get health check-ups (like CT scans).</li>
<li><strong>Happiness is the purpose of life</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth is just the icing on the cake</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>The Principle of Borrowing to Invest</strong>:
<ul>
<li>For money borrowed according to proper principles, <strong>never think about paying it back</strong>.</li>
<li>Once you repay the loan, your risk (Beta value) will immediately increase. For example, an investor with 50% cash and 50% QQQ (Beta=0.5) who uses cash to repay a loan will see their Beta value skyrocket, greatly increasing their risk.</li>
<li>Having cash on hand gives you the confidence to face risks.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is a 65-year-old veteran investor who lost tens of millions in the stock market twice. After starting to learn Teacher James&rsquo;s philosophy after the Chinese New Year, although he had doubts about some points (about 10-15%), he found through deeper study that the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy is continuously refined and has deep logic.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: The market often says, &ldquo;If you miss the best few days of gains, your annualized return will drop significantly.&rdquo; What is the specific definition of this &ldquo;best time for gains&rdquo;?</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Regarding &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; versus &ldquo;mindless rebalancing,&rdquo; if the market is still rising at the end of the year, will rebalancing then cause one to miss out on subsequent gains?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>On Missing Up Days</strong>: This is precisely why it&rsquo;s important &ldquo;not to leave the market.&rdquo; Attempting to time the market will very likely cause you to miss the days with the biggest gains, leading to long-term returns far worse than those of an investor who &ldquo;never sells.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>On Rebalancing</strong>: Attempting &ldquo;smart,&rdquo; irregular rebalancing based on market movements is <strong>active investing</strong>, which cannot be taught because everyone&rsquo;s judgment criteria are different (add at a 10% drop? or 20%?). This approach can deplete your cash in an extreme market (like a three-year decline), leading to bankruptcy. Therefore, the simplest, safest, and most replicable method is to <strong>rebalance once a year</strong>. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that you didn&rsquo;t add more at the low point in April this year, because by the end of the year, your entire portfolio will still have appreciated significantly.</li>

<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Can one use technical indicators (like the 200-day moving average) to assist in decision-makingâ€”becoming conservative when the price is below the average and aggressive when it&rsquo;s above?</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: Are people like Apple CEO Tim Cook considered capitalists or laborers?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>On Technical Indicators</strong>: Completely unnecessary. In the recent V-shaped recovery, using a 200-day moving average strategy would have had you sell and buy back at roughly the same point. Not only would you not have made a profit, you might have lost money on transaction fees, underperforming a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; strategy.</li>
<li><strong>On Tim Cook</strong>: He is a <strong>laborer</strong>, a very highly paid &ldquo;slave.&rdquo; His wealth comes from his salary (including stock options), not from returns on his own invested capital. True capitalists do not have to go to work.</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: What should she do with the Japanese Yen she holds?</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: She has about $200,000 USD in cash (cost basis ~32 TWD/USD) and has already invested $100,000 in US stocks (QQQ/SPY/VT). Now she doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with the remaining cash because she heard the teacher say there are tax issues for Taiwanese people buying US stocks.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Handling the Yen</strong>: Immediately, right now, exchange it for TWD and buy 00662. Don&rsquo;t worry about the exchange rate loss, because the potential return from the stock market is far greater than currency fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Handling the USD Assets</strong>: Again, ignore the exchange rate. For Taiwanese investors, the best approach is to sell the holdings in the US brokerage, transfer the funds back to Taiwan, and buy 00662 with all of it to avoid future estate tax issues. In the long run, the exchange rates for entering and exiting the market will average out, so there&rsquo;s no need for excessive worry.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is 65 and retired. During the recent downturn, his allocation was too aggressive (Beta 1.1), and he had no cash to add at the bottom. He has now adjusted to a Beta of 0.9 (70% QQQ, 10% QLD, 20% Cash).</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Is there a mechanical rule for deploying cash during a major market drop? For example, investing one-third of the cash when the market drops 20%?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This falls under active management. If you must do it, you could consider this: when the market drops 10% (happens almost every year), you can add more once; when it drops 20% (happens every few years), you can add more again. If it continues to fall, you must be very cautious, as it could be a major bear market. At that point, you should switch to a defensive posture, not continue to add. The key is to <strong>never run out of cash</strong>, and the goal of adding to your position is to <strong>maintain your original Beta value (0.9)</strong>, not to raise it.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is due to the <strong>volatility decay</strong> characteristic of leveraged ETFs. In volatile and declining markets, the drop in leveraged ETFs will be more than a multiple of the index&rsquo;s drop, and their recovery is also slower. This is why a full position in leveraged funds is not recommended. For those holding leveraged funds, adding to your position during a major market drop can help you break even faster. For those with a salary, you should normally buy QQQ and use your salary to buy TQQQ during major market dips.</li>

<li>She shared her learning journey: after diligently listening to the teacher&rsquo;s past courses (especially the videos from the 2022 bear market), her conviction was established, many questions resolved themselves, and she became confident in managing minor &ldquo;variations&rdquo; in her portfolio without needing to ask the teacher about everything.</li>
<li>She shared her experience visiting relatives in Thailand and the joy of spending money on experiences. This was because after investing according to the teacher&rsquo;s method, she felt like she had more than enough money, leading to a more relaxed mindset.</li>

<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: I completely agree. There is no absolute right or wrong in investing and opinions; there&rsquo;s no need to debate. He himself has learned that it&rsquo;s better to understand the reasons behind the other person&rsquo;s viewpoint than to argue. He won&rsquo;t &ldquo;burn himself out&rdquo; trying to convince others but rather act as a light, allowing those who are destined to find it themselves.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: Regarding children&rsquo;s education, a friend&rsquo;s Chinese-American child was beaten at school for stopping a black classmate from cutting in line. The school handled it poorly due to &ldquo;political correctness.&rdquo; How should we teach our children to protect themselves when facing bullying and injustice, without losing faith in justice?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: <strong>Safety is always the number one priority</strong>. He quoted a police officer&rsquo;s advice: when faced with a violent attack, the first reaction is to <strong>run</strong>, not to fight back. We must teach our children that defending justice cannot come at the cost of their own physical well-being; we are not martyrs. One can verbally intervene, but if the other person ignores it or shows violent tendencies, one must leave immediately and protect oneself. Society will teach them their lesson; our children don&rsquo;t need to take that risk.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Being out of the market is actually the biggest risk.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This point was central to the entire session. The teacher repeatedly emphasized that compared to the risk of a short-term market decline, the risk of investors exiting out of fear and thereby missing out on huge long-term returns is far greater.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today&rsquo;s laborers who go to work are like the cotton pickers brought from Africa to America in the past. All who work in factories today are slaves to capitalism.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a very sharp and thought-provoking view from the teacher, aimed at awakening people to the nature of capitalism and encouraging them to become capitalists through investment, thereby escaping the status of a &ldquo;laborer.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Longevity is the path to wealth, happiness is the purpose of life, health is the mother of happiness, and wealth is just the icing on the cake.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher shared his philosophy of life, emphasizing what is truly important. Wealth is meant to serve a better life, not be the ultimate goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone says, &ldquo;Pay me 1% and I can be your investment advisor&rdquo;&hellip; that is a scam.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher directly used the language of scammers as an example to strongly remind all students that anyone impersonating him and offering paid financial advice is a scam, urging everyone to protect their assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t defend justice with your own body; we are not martyrs.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This was the core advice given in response to the question about how a child should face school bullying. He stressed that under any circumstances, personal safety is the highest priority, teaching children to uphold their sense of justice while also learning to protect themselves wisely.</p>

<p>This session once again stressed the core discipline of long-term investing: ignore short-term market volatility and firmly believe in the market&rsquo;s long-term upward trend. By analyzing asset allocation, the use of leveraged funds, and debunking common myths like the Buffett Indicator, Teacher James pointed out a simple yet effective path to wealth growth. The Q&amp;A session was rich in content, covering profound discussions from specific investment strategies (like rebalancing timing and leveraged fund allocation) to life philosophies (such as dealing with bullying and the nature of capitalism). The central idea of the entire session is that investors should build a strong psychological foundation, focus on controllable investment principles, and simultaneously pursue a life of health, happiness, and longevity, viewing wealth as a tool for a better life, not the ultimate goal.</p>
