<ul>
<li><strong>Problem &amp; Harm</strong>: Teacher James had long been troubled by snoring problems and later realized their severity. Snoring (Sleep Apnea) leads to reduced blood oxygen concentration at night (he personally dropped as low as 83%). Long-term effects can trigger health risks such as insulin resistance, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, and even dementia.</li>
<li><strong>Treatment Plan</strong>: Through a dentist specializing in sleep therapy (Dr. Hsu at Caipin Dental Clinic), he underwent corrective treatment using a customized oral appliance (mouthpiece). The cost was about 50,000 to 60,000 TWD. This method does not require surgery and is suitable for moderate-level problems.</li>
<li><strong>Significant Results</strong>: After treatment, sleep quality improved drastically, and snoring almost completely disappeared. Comparing data from the <code>SnoreLab</code> App and <code>Apple Watch</code>: before treatment, snoring time accounted for 17% of sleep time with frequent awakenings; after treatment, the snoring ratio dropped to 0-1%, with continuous and deep sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Advice</strong>: The teacher suggests that friends with similar troubles take this issue seriously. You can use apps like <code>SnoreLab</code> for preliminary detection and consult professional sleep specialists; dental correction might be a relatively simple initial solution.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Core Warning</strong>: Teacher James, in a very serious tone, emphasized again that <strong>Non-US tax residents (those without US citizenship or Green Card) must absolutely not open accounts with US brokerages (such as Schwab, IBKR, Fidelity, etc.) to invest or buy real estate in their personal names.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Three Core Risks</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>High Estate Tax</strong>: Once the asset owner passes away, their assets in the US will face an estate tax of up to 40%.</li>
<li><strong>Account Freezing Risk</strong>: US financial regulation is very strict, and accounts can be frozen at any time for various reasons. For example:
<ul>
<li>The bank cannot contact the person (emails bounced, phone numbers invalid).</li>
<li>The actual flow of funds in the account does not match the purpose declared at opening (e.g., large investment sums moving in and out of an account declared for living expenses).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Extremely Complex Inheritance Procedures</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The inheritance process is cumbersome, requiring a large number of documents like death certificates and household registers, which need notarization and English translation, and finally authentication by the US Consulate in the local area.</li>
<li>Inheritance requires going through the US court&rsquo;s &ldquo;Probate&rdquo; process, taking at least six months or more.</li>
<li>Heirs usually need to hire US lawyers to handle it, which is costly and complex, potentially leading family members to give up inheritance, resulting in the assets vanishing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is absolutely no need to take this risk. Investors should buy ETF products tracking the Nasdaq 100 Index through local brokerages in their own country or region.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dividend Source Structure</strong>: QQQI&rsquo;s dividends do not rely entirely on profit distributions from constituent companies. Its composition is relatively complex and stable, coming mainly from three aspects:
<ol>
<li><strong>Actual Dividends</strong>: Dividends distributed by the 80% QQQ it holds.</li>
<li><strong>Option Strategy Income</strong>: Income (premiums) generated by selling Covered Calls and Call Spreads. This part of the income is usually correlated with central bank interest rate levels.</li>
<li><strong>Rebalancing &amp; Stabilization Fund</strong>: When the held QQQ appreciates significantly due to market rise, fund managers will sell a portion of the stocks to convert profits into cash, used to distribute dividends stably, acting similarly to a stabilization fund.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Purpose &amp; Trade-off</strong>: The goal of QQQI is to provide investors with stable, predictable cash flow. To achieve this, it sacrifices some capital appreciation (since it only holds 80% of QQQ, its Beta is about 0.8). Its total return will be slightly lower than QQQ, but for retirees who need stable living expenses, this is worth it.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rebalancing After Asset Appreciation</strong>: When assets using the 433 allocation grow significantly (e.g., from $1 million to $5 million), the &ldquo;autopilot system&rdquo; can be reset to improve quality of life.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Assets at 5 million, existing loan at 250k. You can take 500k (twice the loan amount) from the 5 million and put it into a Money Market Fund as a new cash reserve. The remaining 4.5 million is then allocated via 433. This way, annual disposable living expenses can be calculated at 2% of the new total asset value, i.e., $100,000 (5M * 2%), significantly improving quality of life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Core Principle of Stock Pledging: Borrow But Do Not Repay</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Wrong Operation</strong>: <strong>Absolutely do not use your cash reserves (Money Market Fund) to repay the stock pledge loan.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reason</strong>: Once you use cash to repay, your asset allocation ratio is destroyed. The reduction in the cash portion causes the risk (Beta) of the entire portfolio to rise from the original 0.9 to 1.11, significantly increasing volatility and violating the original intention of asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Mindset</strong>: People who pledge stocks should &ldquo;ignore interest.&rdquo; Because the interest generated by your cash portion (e.g., 3%) and the returns generated by the investment portion (e.g., 15%) are far higher than the loan interest you pay (e.g., 6-7%). The core function of cash reserves is for rebalancing during market downturns, not for repayment.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: After retirement, there are still individual stocks with high profits accounting for about ten-plus percent of total assets (such as Tesla, Google, Microsoft) in the account. How should they be handled?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: There are two options.
<ol>
<li><strong>Sell Immediately</strong>: Sell it all at once and pay the 15% long-term capital gains tax. The advantage is it&rsquo;s simple and done once and for all.</li>
<li><strong>Sell in Batches</strong>: Wait until the Roth Conversion is fully completed in 7-8 years. When personal income decreases, sell stocks in batches annually utilizing the tax-free allowance for long-term capital gains (about $60,000 for singles, deducting Social Security and other income) to save on taxes. But this method is more troublesome. The teacher leans towards the first option for simplicity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Due to high taxes and health insurance payments after retirement, annual expenses have increased, causing total assets to be slightly lower than 33 times annual expenses. Can stock pledging still be done?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: Absolutely. You can still borrow via pledging to pay taxes and living expenses. If the required withdrawal ratio is higher than the standard 2% of the 433 allocation, you can adjust the asset allocation appropriately. For example, increase the proportion of high-dividend QQQI in the retirement account. QQQI will generate stable cash flow to replenish your cash pool, which effectively lowers the risk (Beta) of the entire portfolio, thereby allowing you to safely increase the borrowing ratio (e.g., up to 3%).</li>

<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Comment</strong>: Thanks to Dr. Henry for the professional addition, and emphasized again that everyone should take this issue seriously and seek professional medical help.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong> (Asked by Su): A friend used a CPAP machine for a year and the problem was solved, but recently the doctor asked him to use it again. Why?

<li><strong>Dr. Henry&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: CPAP is assisted breathing and usually cannot cure the disease itself unless the problem was caused by obesity and weight loss was successful. If weight rebounds, the problem may recur. If symptoms persist, continuous use or other treatment options like surgery are needed.</li>

<li><strong>Question 2</strong> (Asked by Houqin): If surgery is needed, what specific part is treated?

<li><strong>Question</strong>: As a new investor from mainland China, with total assets of about 700k RMB dispersed across IB, domestic brokerages, and HSBC Hong Kong. Since the asset amount is small, is asset allocation necessary? How should the leverage part be operated?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Account Adjustment</strong>: You should transfer assets from IB to HSBC Hong Kong as soon as possible to avoid US estate tax and account risks.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation</strong>: You can buy the Nasdaq 100 2x Leveraged ETF listed in Hong Kong via HSBC, but the leveraged position should not exceed 20% of total assets. Before starting to pledge for living expenses, there is no need to frequently rebalance the leverage part.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Position</strong>: For the cash part in the Hong Kong account, you can consult HSBC to see which money market funds (such as CSOP US Dollar Money Market Fund, 9096 or 3096) are eligible for pledging.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: Since the investment portfolio (QQQ, QLD, Cash) itself generates dividends and interest, and these cash flows might already be enough for living, why not use this money directly instead of borrowing and paying interest?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: This is a core conceptual error. <strong>Absolutely do not spend your own money (including dividends and interest)!</strong> Your money is a &ldquo;Golden Goose&rdquo; that can generate money and should be continuously invested in the market to obtain an annualized return of about 15%. The cost of borrowing is only 6-7%. Spending your own dividends is equivalent to giving up higher returns, which is not cost-effective at all.</li>

<li><strong>Share 1</strong>: Shared the experience of his friend within the &ldquo;system&rdquo; in China. Because this friend could not bypass the firewall to get outside information, he listened to his wife and invested in Chinese real estate, resulting in assets falling from a peak of nearly 60 million RMB to less than 20 million; meanwhile, the portion invested in 513100 (A-share Nasdaq ETF) following Mike&rsquo;s advice performed excellently, forming a sharp contrast. This highlights the importance of accessing correct information and cognition.</li>
<li><strong>Share 2</strong>: Shared that his doctor friend was skeptical about Google AlphaFold (protein folding prediction), arguing that &ldquo;humans can&rsquo;t even synthesize artificial starch, how can they analyze all proteins.&rdquo;

<blockquote>
<p>Investing makes you wealthy, but borrowing makes you a tycoon.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When answering student Lily&rsquo;s question about &ldquo;what he would say to his younger self if he could go back,&rdquo; the teacher emphasized the huge amplifying effect of using leverage early on for wealth growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have stock pledging, don&rsquo;t spend a single dime of your own assets. Why spend your own money? Your money can be invested for a 15% return, while borrowing only costs you 6% or 7%.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: In response to student Houqin&rsquo;s question about &ldquo;why not live off dividends instead of borrowing,&rdquo; the teacher hit the nail on the head regarding the opportunity cost of spending dividends, which is the core logic of the stock pledging strategy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not borrowing is where the risk lies; borrowing is actually lower risk.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Re-emphasizing that borrowing (pledging) under reasonable allocation carries lower risk than using principal (including dividends), because the latter destroys asset allocation and increases portfolio volatility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We rely on the 100 strongest companies in the US; there is no investment more stable than this.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When commenting on student Laurence&rsquo;s share, the teacher explained the source of confidence in investing in the Nasdaq 100 Index: trusting the long-term creativity of the top tier of human enterprises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are not a US tax resident; do not open an account with a US brokerage to invest, and do not buy assets in the US. Understood?
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: The teacher used an extremely serious and repetitive tone to emphasize the severe risks of direct investment in the US for non-US residents. This is an important reminder for all overseas investors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, after putting all my funds into QQQ with these asset allocations, I have &lsquo;done what had to be done, subject to no further becoming&rsquo; (所作已办，不受后有). That is, there will be no more troubles of greed, anger, and ignorance following me.
&ndash; Lily</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Lily shared her understanding of the teacher&rsquo;s &ldquo;Formless Investment&rdquo; philosophy, combining it with the Buddhist state of liberation from afflictions, vividly describing the inner peace brought by index investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We humans are not born to work&hellip; slowly let money work for us, so we can retire with stability and live what we call freedom.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: The teacher encouraged the student couple, explaining that the true meaning of financial freedom is liberating time and life to do what one truly wants, rather than being burdened by work for a lifetime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I am old, when I become a grandmother&hellip; I want to be a rich grandma.
&ndash; Shu</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Shu shared her beautiful vision for the future, hoping that through investment, she will not only make herself wealthy but also benefit her descendants, becoming a generous elder with financial confidence.</p>

<p>This episode, ranging from personal health to global macroeconomics, from practical investment to philosophy of life, once again builds a complete and firm investment worldview for us. Teacher James&rsquo; core message remains consistent: find and stick to the simplest and most essential investment truth—<strong>long-term holding and complete trust in index funds composed of top enterprises.</strong> He not only provided the methodology of &ldquo;what to do&rdquo; (buy indices) and &ldquo;how to do it&rdquo; (asset allocation and pledging) but, more importantly, by repeatedly emphasizing the investment risks for non-US residents and the importance of mindset construction, he cleared the most dangerous traps and common ideological obstacles on our investment path. Whether new investors or senior students, everyone can find the guidance and confidence needed for their current stage in this episode, eventually walking towards the path of financial freedom with peace of mind.</p>

He explains in detail how to use high-dividend products (such as QQQI) and traditional index portfolios to achieve this goal, and updates the asset allocation simulation tool, sharing simulation results for investors in Taiwan and the US. Additionally, the content covers cash management and ETF selection options for non-US tax residents in mainland China, Hong Kong, and elsewhere.

</h2>
<p>The core theme of this episode is <strong>&ldquo;Redefining the Retirement Threshold.&rdquo;</strong> Teacher James overturns the traditional notion that one needs assets equal to 50 times their annual expenses to retire. Instead, he proposes a more positive and feasible plan: <strong>Retirement is possible with assets equal to just 15 times your annual expenses.</strong> The core of this plan lies in cleverly combining the stable cash flow provided by high-dividend ETFs with the appreciation potential of growth-oriented index investing. This significantly lowers the financial threshold for retirement, opening up the possibility of early retirement for more people. At the same time, the course updates the practical asset allocation simulation tool and provides specific investment tool recommendations for investors in different regions.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Strategy</strong>: Divide assets equivalent to 15 times annual expenses into two parts:
<ol>
<li><strong>10x Annual Expenses</strong>: Invest in high-dividend products to generate an annualized dividend of approximately 12% as stable cash flow to cover living expenses.</li>
<li><strong>5x Annual Expenses</strong>: Invest in a growth-oriented investment portfolio (such as the 433 allocation) to allow assets to continue growing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>High-Dividend Tool Recommendations</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>USA</strong>: QQQI, with an annualized dividend yield of about 12%.</li>
<li><strong>Taiwan</strong>: Can purchase QQQI via sub-brokerage (复委托).</li>
<li><strong>China</strong>: CSOP Huatai-PineBridge CSI Dividend Low Volatility ETF (008163).</li>
<li><strong>Hong Kong</strong>: Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (3416.HK), currently with a dividend yield as high as 16%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advantages</strong>: This plan makes retirement goals feel less distant, as investors don&rsquo;t need to wait until they accumulate 30 or 50 times their annual expenses. Fund managers handle the professional operations (such as selling stocks or utilizing options to generate income), providing investors with stable cash flow and shielding them from the direct psychological impact of market volatility.</li>

<li><strong>Simulation Conclusions (Based on 167% Maintenance Requirement)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Taiwan Investors (433 Allocation, Pledging Rate 3%)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Can withdraw a maximum of <strong>2.5%</strong> for living expenses annually without margin calls (liquidation).</li>
<li><strong>Special Reminder</strong>: Must consider the ~15% exchange rate fluctuation between TWD and USD. This affects the maintenance rate by about 10%, so using a 167% maintenance requirement is safer than 140%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>US Investors (Pledging LTV ~80%)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Can withdraw a maximum of <strong>2.1%</strong> for living expenses annually.</li>
<li><strong>Safety Recommendation</strong>: To leave a margin of safety (moat), it is suggested that Taiwan investors withdraw around 2.2%, and US investors withdraw 1.8%-1.9%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Non-Pledgers (80/20 Allocation)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Can withdraw <strong>2.7%</strong> annually, but the total asset value will barely grow, meaning they cannot enjoy the compounding effect of asset appreciation.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Q1</strong>: My family is well-off. How can I provide correct financial education to my young children to prevent them from developing bad spending habits?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Distinguish Consumption Types</strong>: Teach children from a young age to distinguish between &ldquo;spiritual consumption&rdquo; (e.g., travel, experiences) and &ldquo;material consumption&rdquo; (e.g., toys, brand names). Encourage the former, moderate the latter.</li>
<li><strong>Define Ownership</strong>: Clearly tell children that the money belongs to the parents, not them. Parents have the right to decide whether to meet their material demands. Do not let them take things for granted.</li>
<li><strong>Example is Better than Precept</strong>: Parents&rsquo; own spending habits are the best role model. If parents are thrifty and do not pursue material comparison (e.g., a car is fine as long as it drives; no need to chase the latest model), children will naturally be influenced.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q2</strong>: For Taiwan investors, QQQI tax refunds are delayed. Are there other local similar high-dividend funds as alternatives?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: I haven&rsquo;t specifically researched local funds in Taiwan. If you want to compare, you need to look at a few key indicators: 1. <strong>Max Drawdown</strong>, especially performance during the 2022 bear market; 2. <strong>Total Return</strong>, which is the sum of capital gains plus dividends. Compare these with QQQI to see which suits your needs better.</li>

<li><strong>Share 1</strong>: His middle school child spends all pocket money on game points, refuses to save, and even half-jokingly called his father &ldquo;shabby&rdquo; (stingy).
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Do Not Reward Grades with Money</strong>: Studying is the child&rsquo;s own responsibility. Using money as an incentive may distort their values.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Improper Speech Immediately</strong>: When a child says disrespectful words like &ldquo;shabby,&rdquo; you must correct them immediately and seriously. Make them understand that this is the parents&rsquo; money, and they have no right to judge it like that. Some jokes are not to be made. You must set clear boundaries and rules for the child.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Share 2</strong>: Discussing recent social cases, lamenting the difficulty of raising children.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: Once children become adults, parents&rsquo; responsibility is limited; all the home can provide is a bed and a pair of chopsticks. The key is to set the rules well from a young age. If parents themselves have correct consumption concepts and are not wasteful, they can set a good example for their children.</li>

<li><strong>Share</strong>: After following the teacher&rsquo;s advice to configure 433, felt more mentally stable, quality of life improved, and started promoting investment concepts to family in China.</li>
<li><strong>Q1</strong>: As a Taiwanese working in the mainland, how to safely transfer funds back to Taiwan after exceeding the annual foreign exchange quota of $50,000 USD for RMB income?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: This is a difficult problem; I don&rsquo;t have a perfect solution. Apart from carrying cash personally, official channels are indeed limited. Operating through company accounts is also very complex and requires trusted relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q2</strong>: For RMB that cannot be brought back to Taiwan for the time being, should I buy short-term products like government bonds or invest directly in Chinese index funds (like 513100)?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: Directly investing in index funds is also a good choice. Since the funds cannot be moved out for now, it is better to let them continue to appreciate in the local market. There is always a possibility that China&rsquo;s foreign exchange controls will loosen in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q3</strong>: Should I put all assets (including the cash portion) into the pledge account to keep them &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: I do not recommend doing this. You should keep a portion of assets in a regular account to maintain flexibility. In case of brokerage policy changes (e.g., increased interest rates, account freezes), you have other assets as bargaining chips or emergency funds, so you won&rsquo;t be completely passive.</li>

<li><strong>Q</strong>: In Mainland China, should I exchange some emergency funds from RMB to USD to buy QDII USD short-term bond funds with higher interest?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: Yes. Although there is exchange rate risk, the 3.4% USD interest is far higher than the 1.5% RMB reverse repo. In the long run, the USD is a strong currency, and the probability of depreciation is far lower than that of the RMB. For higher interest returns, bearing some exchange rate volatility is worth it.</li>

<li><strong>Q1</strong>: Did a large Roth IRA conversion at the end of the year but didn&rsquo;t prepay taxes, worried about penalties.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: Don&rsquo;t worry. The brokerage will give you a 1099-R tax form, and the system will calculate it automatically when filing taxes. Even if there is a small penalty, the interest rate is very low, equivalent to borrowing money from the government for a year at a very low cost, which is completely acceptable.</li>

<li><strong>Q2</strong>: Because of this conversion, income exceeded the limit and can no longer enjoy Obama Care (Affordable Care Act). How to find suitable insurance?

<li><strong>Q1</strong>: Teacher suggests retirees with insufficient assets buy high-dividend products, but the total return of such products is lower than indices, and paying dividends is essentially selling assets. Why not just sell QQQ based on needs yourself?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: Mainly three points: 1. <strong>Overcoming Human Weakness</strong>: Operating it yourself makes you susceptible to market emotions, chasing highs and selling lows. Fund managers can execute strategies more rationally. 2. <strong>Providing Downside Protection</strong>: For example, in 2022, QQQ fell nearly 40%, while QQQI only fell about 30%. 3. <strong>Unique Income Source</strong>: QQQI earns extra premiums (about 4-5%) by selling covered call options, which is a stable cash flow source difficult for ordinary investors to replicate, ensuring dividends can be paid even in a bear market.</li>

<li><strong>Q</strong>: Regarding pledging, assuming annual expenses are 600k, pledging 3 million (5x) in the first year. In the second year, a total of 1.2 million is needed. Do I need to pledge another 3 million, or how does it work? Do I need to repay the principal after the 18-month loan?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: In the second year, the total debt is 1.2 million. You need to ensure the total market value of the assets pledged inside is maintained at 6 million (5 times 1.2 million). You can check how much the 3 million pledged in the first year has appreciated (e.g., to 4 million), and then just make up the difference (pledge another 2 million). There is no need to repay the principal after the loan expires; just pay the interest and handle the &ldquo;renewal,&rdquo; provided the maintenance rate is higher than the bank&rsquo;s minimum requirement (recommended above 167%).</li>

<p>The core of this session is the introduction of a new portfolio backtesting simulation App, used to deeply analyze and compare the differences between <strong>stock pledging</strong> and <strong>non-pledging</strong> retirement withdrawal strategies. Through live demonstrations, Teacher James shows the maximum safe withdrawal rates (approx. 1.5%-1.8%) and risks of pledging strategies under different markets (Taiwan vs. US), interest rates, and LTV (Loan-to-Value) ratios. The core takeaway is: while pledging can significantly increase total terminal assets over the long term, it demands extremely high cash flow stability and very conservative withdrawal rates. Conversely, non-pledging strategies allow for a higher withdrawal rate (approx. 2.7%) but sacrifice asset growth for greater flexibility.</p>

<p>Developed by community member Martin, this App simulates long-term returns and risks under various asset allocations, pledging conditions, and withdrawal strategies.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Taiwan Scenario (40% QQQ, 30% QLD, 30% Cash)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parameters</strong>: Initial principal of 1 million, 3% interest rate, 60% LTV.</li>
<li><strong>Withdrawal Testing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Annual withdrawal of 1.5% (15,000): Results show assets survive safely from 2000 to 2025.</li>
<li>Annual withdrawal of 1.6% (16,000): Results show the portfolio is liquidated (fails) in 2009.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Under Taiwan&rsquo;s pledging conditions, the upper limit for a safe withdrawal rate is very strict at <strong>1.5%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>US Scenario (40% QQQ, 30% QLD, 30% Cash)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parameters</strong>: 6.5% interest rate, higher LTV (70% for QQQ, 95% for Cash, but QLD cannot be pledged).</li>
<li><strong>Withdrawal Testing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Annual withdrawal of 1.8%: Safely survives.</li>
<li>Annual withdrawal of 1.9%: Results in failure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Due to more relaxed LTV conditions in the US, the safe withdrawal rate can reach <strong>1.8%</strong>, showing slightly higher risk tolerance than in Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Interest Rates</strong>: When Teacher James lowered the US interest rate to 5% (the setting used in early Excel simulations), the safe withdrawal rate rose to <strong>2.1%</strong>, proving that interest rates are a critical variable in pledging safety.</li>

<p><strong>Non-Pledging Strategy (80% QQQ, 20% Cash)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximum Withdrawal Rate</strong>: <strong>2.7%</strong> of assets annually.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome</strong>: While it safely survives 25 years, by 2025, the total asset value has barely grown, returning to its 2000 initial level. This strategy sacrifices capital appreciation for higher immediate cash flow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Comparison at Equal Withdrawal Rates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assume both strategies withdraw only 1.5% (15,000) annually.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Pledger</strong>: Assets grow to 1.61 million by 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Pledger (Taiwan Plan)</strong>: Assets grow to 4.75 million by 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Given the same low expenses, the pledging strategy can result in several times more asset growth. Investors must weigh &ldquo;higher asset growth&rdquo; against &ldquo;higher current cash flow.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pledging Risks are High</strong>: A 1.5% withdrawal rate means your total assets must be 66 times your annual expenses, a high bar for most people.</li>
<li><strong>Combine with High-Dividend ETFs</strong>: Retirees might consider allocating a small portion (e.g., 10%-20%) to high-dividend products (like QYI) to generate stable cash flow, reducing the amount and pressure of pledged loans.</li>
<li><strong>For Those Still Working</strong>: You can experiment with pledging while continuing monthly contributions, which makes the outlook much more optimistic.</li>

<li><strong>James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: There are two ways. One is paying with cash from your Brokerage Account, which is the best way as it maximizes the funds moved into the Roth. The second is having the broker withhold taxes during the conversion (e.g., convert 200k, withhold 20k for tax), but this reduces the principal entering the Roth.</li>

<li><strong>Q1</strong>: In worst-case simulations (like the year 2000), cash positions and debt get very close. Is this safe enough?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: Yes, the simulation result is a &ldquo;narrow escape.&rdquo; In an extreme market crash of 85%, the assets just barely avoid liquidation. This illustrates why the withdrawal rate cannot be higher—2% is the tipping point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q2</strong>: When markets crash and cash is tight, should one be more cautious with &ldquo;Smart Rebalancing,&rdquo; such as reducing or pausing cash injections?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: Excellent question. We are indeed exploring more conservative approaches. One principle: if your cash reserve is lower than 15 (or even 20) years of living expenses, you should not touch it for rebalancing. An alternative is to sell some QQQ to buy QLD for rebalancing instead of using cash, preserving your safety net.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q3</strong>: When should company-issued semiconductor stocks be sold? Given tax issues, is it worth waiting or using complex Exchange Funds?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: As long as you have held them for over a year, a fixed long-term capital gains tax applies, which is independent of your personal income. Don&rsquo;t wait; sell after one year to diversify risk early. Avoid complex financial products like Exchange Funds—simple is best.</li>

<p>This session, through a practical backtesting App, turned the abstract concept of stock pledging into something concrete. Teacher James not only demonstrated the tool but, more importantly, revealed the trade-offs between risk and reward in different strategies. Pledging can significantly amplify wealth but requires extreme discipline; non-pledging is more flexible and suits those with higher cash flow needs. Most movingly, the real stories of students—especially Wu Li Yun from a grassroots background and Min&rsquo;s hardworking girlfriend—vividly illustrated the core philosophy: &ldquo;Investing can change your destiny.&rdquo; This was not just a technical analysis class, but a deep exchange about hope, peace, and life awakening, reaffirming the community&rsquo;s belief in long-term holding and simple investing.</p>

<p>The core theme of this episode revolves around adhering to the &ldquo;buy and do not sell&rdquo; index investment discipline and applying it to financial decisions in real life. Teacher James emphasizes that investors should completely ignore all external noise such as market fluctuations, macroeconomics, and corporate earnings reports. He focuses on arguing that young people should prioritize increasing liquid assets rather than purchasing real estate, and shares how to solve housing and living cash flow problems by activating assets (such as selling a house to invest), thereby avoiding the trap of being &ldquo;house rich, cash poor&rdquo; (poor until only a room is left). In addition, the course delves into principles for the safe use of leverage and loans, and how to conduct robust asset allocation based on individual circumstances.</p>

<li><strong>Governments and Banks Sell Fear</strong>: They often use concepts like &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t buy now, you won&rsquo;t be able to afford it&rdquo; or &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t have a place to live when you&rsquo;re old&rdquo; to create anxiety, urging people to take on mortgages prematurely.</li>
<li><strong>Increase Liquid Assets First, Then Buy a House with Ease</strong>: One should first increase liquid assets through investment. When assets are substantial, buying a house is as simple as buying slippers, and one can even use stock pledging to borrow money for the purchase (&ldquo;empty-handed white wolf&rdquo; strategy) instead of draining one&rsquo;s own cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>A House is a &ldquo;Prison,&rdquo; Not an Asset</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Mindset Trap</strong>: Ordinary people buying a home for self-use is different from a developer&rsquo;s high-turnover business model. Living in it for decades locks up the asset completely, eventually leading to being &ldquo;poor until only a room is left.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty in Liquidation</strong>: Even if the house price rises, it cannot be easily liquidated for living expenses. Transaction costs are high (taxes, agency fees), and the turnover rate is extremely slow.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance Costs</strong>: Old houses face various maintenance issues like leaks, termites, and burst pipes, consuming mental energy.</li>

<ul>
<li>Taking the US as an example, a retiree with a $1 million property should not live a frugal life guarding the house.</li>
<li><strong>Solution</strong>: Sell the $1 million house.
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1 (Solve Housing)</strong>: Take $300,000 and invest in high-dividend products (like QQQYI, 12% annualized yield), generating $36,000 in cash flow annually, sufficient to pay a monthly rent of $3,000. The remaining $700,000 can be used for investment and living.</li>
<li><strong>Option 2 (Solve Housing + Living)</strong>: Take $600,000 to invest in QQQYI, generating $72,000 annually. This not only covers rent but provides an extra $3,000 monthly for living expenses.</li>

<li><strong>Be Wary of Loan Models in Different Regions</strong>:

<li>Question: A new student of two weeks in Taiwan, currently investing in high-dividend and market-cap ETFs (ratio 3:2). Has a mortgage but enough funds to pay it off. To retire within 10 years, considering a &ldquo;financial mortgage&rdquo; (interest-only, 7-10 year term) to cash out more funds for investment. Worried that the 10-year loan term is shorter than the 15-year &ldquo;guaranteed profit&rdquo; cycle mentioned by the teacher. If the market drops 85% at maturity and the bank pulls funding leading to bankruptcy, how to resolve this?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Do not recommend financial mortgages</strong>: This type of short-term loan with non-renewal risk is very dangerous. Once unemployed or if the market falls for a long time, you face bankruptcy risk.</li>
<li><strong>Suggest Traditional Mortgage</strong>: Suggest converting the mortgage to a 30-year principal and interest repayment loan. Extend the term as much as possible to lower monthly payments, thereby releasing more cash flow for investment.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Allocation Suggestion</strong>: For funds of 6 million TWD, start with a robust allocation, such as 70% 00662 (tracking Nasdaq 100) and 30% 00865B (Short-term Treasury/Cash). Do not rush into leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Gradually Adapt to Leverage</strong>: Since she previously invested in high-dividend products, her volatility tolerance is unknown. Suggests starting with a 10% position if trying leveraged funds (like 00670L) to personally experience the feeling of a 30%-60% market drop, then adjust gradually.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Sufficient Cash</strong>: Must reserve 2-3 years of living expenses as cash. Overall, a 6:1:3 (60% Market Cap, 10% Leverage, 30% Cash) allocation is a suitable starting point for now.</li>

<li>Question 1: Father has dizziness issues, similar to what the teacher once shared about his own father (carotid artery issue). Asking for the contact of the doctor who performed the stent procedure for the teacher&rsquo;s father.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is experience sharing, not medical advice. He pointed out that such issues should consult &ldquo;Cardiovascular Surgery&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cardiology,&rdquo; not the intuitive &ldquo;Neurology.&rdquo; He found Dr. <strong>Shih Chun-che</strong> (Cardiovascular Surgery) at Taipei Medical University, and the surgery was performed by his brother, Superintendent <strong>Shih Chun-min</strong>, at Wan Fang Hospital. Suggests consulting relevant departments at large teaching hospitals (e.g., NTU, Veterans General, Chang Gung).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: How to educate the next generation (4 years old)? He told his child he doesn&rsquo;t like his job as an engineer and encourages the child to learn arts (piano, dance) or become a dentist, hoping the child won&rsquo;t become a &ldquo;laborer&rdquo; like him and fall into class reproduction.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Correcting &ldquo;Laborer Thinking&rdquo;</strong>: The teacher pointed out sharply that the father&rsquo;s educational method is essentially still &ldquo;laborer thinking&rdquo; because he links interests directly to &ldquo;finding a job that won&rsquo;t be replaced&rdquo; and income.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Should Not equate to Income</strong>: The core of education is guiding children to explore and find what they truly love and want to do as soon as they wake up, not for making a living. Things you like don&rsquo;t necessarily have to have a salary.</li>
<li><strong>Parents are the Backup</strong>: The parents&rsquo; responsibility is to be the safety net during the child&rsquo;s life adventure, providing basic food and shelter.</li>
<li><strong>Cultivate Independence</strong>: After adulthood, children must learn to be responsible for their extra desires (like new phones, travel) and earn money to satisfy them.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Guidance</strong>: Parents should take children to experience the world, not instill concepts of &ldquo;what job is good/bad,&rdquo; and definitely not pass on their own negative emotions about work.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:

<li>Question: Why recommend investing in QQQ (Nasdaq 100) instead of S&amp;P 500? Isn&rsquo;t QQQ more volatile?

<li>Question 1: Misunderstood stock pledging. She thought her 4:3:3 combination (400k QQQ, 300k QLD, 300k Cash) allowed her to borrow $540k based on the broker&rsquo;s limit, asking how to use this money.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is an extremely dangerous misunderstanding. Borrowing such a high ratio means immediate bankruptcy if the market drops 80%. <strong>The principle of safe pledging is: borrow at most 2% of total assets annually.</strong> For $1 million in assets, the safe borrowing limit is only $20,000 per year for consumption or reinvestment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: For a retired person, if the 30% cash is only enough for 10 years of living expenses, and part of it is spent when the market falls, is there extra money to &ldquo;buy the dip&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>Non-retirees should not live off investment principal.</li>
<li>For retirees, ideal cash reserves should cover <strong>15 years</strong> of expenses (corresponding to total assets being 50 times annual expenses). If cash only covers 10 years, it means total assets are insufficient to support a leveraged configuration like 4:3:3, and high-dividend ETFs should be added to supplement cash flow.</li>
<li>The 15 years of living expenses used for safety <strong>must never</strong> be used to buy the dip, as this is for survival. Only &ldquo;extra&rdquo; cash beyond 15 years of expenses can be considered for investment during market drops.</li>

<li>Question 1: If one has a separate stable cash reserve, can the investment portfolio be allocated as 60% QQQ and 40% QLD?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You cannot view the investment portfolio in isolation like this. You must calculate the ratio with all assets (including that &ldquo;separate&rdquo; cash) together. For example, if total assets are 1.4 million (of which 400k is cash), then a 700k QQQ and 300k QLD allocation is actually <strong>50% QQQ : 21% QLD : 29% Cash</strong>. This 5:2:3 ratio is reasonable because the leveraged fund (21%) does not exceed cash (29%) or the prototype fund (50%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: In the long run, is QLD&rsquo;s return guaranteed to be better than QQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>Absolutely not.</strong> After a deep bear market, leveraged funds may take decades to recover, while QQQ recovers much faster. The purpose of holding leveraged funds is to harvest profits into QQQ or cash through &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; during bull markets; it is not an asset to be held mindlessly forever. If the position becomes too high, it must be adjusted <strong>immediately</strong>; you cannot wait even one day.</li>

<li>Question: Daughter is working; can she put her monthly investment of $500-$1000 entirely into QLD?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: No. Adults with income should not put their entire investment into leveraged funds. QLD is only suitable for investing very small amounts of &ldquo;lucky money&rdquo; (like $30-$50) for young children. His daughter should primarily invest in QQQ or QQQM.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t buy a house quickly, prices will keep rising, and you won&rsquo;t be able to afford it later&hellip; Only by understanding the principles of capitalism and increasing your liquid assets first will buying a house become as simple as buying slippers.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: The teacher criticizing the prevalent &ldquo;home-buying anxiety&rdquo; in society and proposing that after achieving financial freedom through investment, purchasing a home will no longer be a difficult problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ordinary people buy houses&hellip; and after living there for forty-odd years, they become &lsquo;poor until only one room is left.&rsquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Describing the ultimate dilemma of ordinary people treating real estate as their only major asset—the asset is locked up and cannot generate cash flow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In front of the market, we must admit that we know nothing&hellip; If you think you know, then you are too overconfident.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Emphasizing that the primary mindset for successful investment is humility, admitting the inability to predict the market, thereby avoiding wrong decisions due to overconfidence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can solve (the housing problem) with $300,000, why use $1 million, $2 million, or even $3 million assets to solve it?

<p>We parents are their backup&hellip; at least they have a bed to sleep in and food to eat during their adventure process.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Elaborating on the role of parents in children&rsquo;s education, which is providing security and encouraging children to bravely explore their own life paths.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leveraged funds&hellip; when they rise, you must move the earned money to cash or QQQ, otherwise the money you made is in vain, and eventually, one drop will send you back to pre-liberation days.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Explaining that leveraged funds cannot be held stubbornly for the long term; profits must be locked in through rebalancing, otherwise floating gains accumulated will vanish rapidly in a bear market and be hard to recover.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first step in financial management is to avoid financial management&hellip; you need to stay away from financial advisors.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Commenting on the financial services industry, reminding students of the importance of self-learning and mastering their own financial destiny to avoid being exploited by professionals charging high management fees.</p>

<p>This episode began with a warning about community scams, reinforcing the cornerstones of CLEC investment philosophy—discipline and mindset. Through a profound analysis of the concept of &ldquo;real estate,&rdquo; which is deeply rooted in Chinese society, Teacher James guided everyone to step out of traditional thinking frameworks, truly understand the value of &ldquo;liquid assets,&rdquo; and provided concrete and feasible asset activation plans. The Q&amp;A session covered multiple levels from asset allocation, leverage use, tax planning to children&rsquo;s education. The teacher&rsquo;s replies not only offered operational advice but also conveyed the underlying philosophy of life and risk management thoughts. The entire sharing session warns us that true financial freedom stems from correct cognition, strict discipline, and reverence for risk, rather than chasing or predicting the market.</p>

The core idea is &amp;#39;survival first, profit later,&amp;#39; meaning long-term returns are contingent on being able to withstand market volatility without being liquidated. This session highlights QQQI as a retirement cash flow tool and delves into the concept of real estate as a consumer good rather than an investment.

<p>This session focuses on <strong>the mindset and actions investors should adopt amidst optimistic market expectations</strong>. The core idea is that the market is on the verge of a significant rally, and investors should enter decisively without hesitation. Teacher James emphasizes that the key to successful investing is <strong>&ldquo;survival first, profit later.&rdquo;</strong> Only by staying in the market for the long term and enduring all volatility can one ultimately enjoy the rich rewards of compounding. Therefore, constructing an asset allocation that allows you to weather any storm is crucial.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market Outlook &amp; Capital Flow</strong>: The market is poised for a breakout to new highs. A strong rally is expected in December. An important backdrop is that QT (Quantitative Tightening) ended on December 1st. The central bank will now inject about $15 billion into the market weekly, totaling around $50 billion per month. This will create a massive capital flow, driving the market upward.</li>
<li><strong>The First Principle of Investing: Survive</strong>:
<ul>
<li>An annualized return of 15% is predicated on being able to stay invested for over 30 years without being liquidated due to fear or excessive leverage. If you exit midway, even the highest returns are irrelevant to you.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s better to choose a stable asset allocation that can survive any risk, even if the annualized return is only 7%. The key is to survive for 30 years or even longer.</li>
<li>The core of investing is <strong>doing the right thing</strong>. Regardless of the market&rsquo;s current state, you should always be buying. Be happy when it goes up, and don&rsquo;t panic when it goes down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Coping with Market Sentiment</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The principle of &ldquo;be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy&rdquo; is hard to execute. The simplest way to practice it is to <strong>resolutely not sell</strong>.</li>
<li>Investors need to admit that they &ldquo;know nothing&rdquo; and cannot predict market highs or lows. This allows them to respect the market and hold for the long term.</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s channel teaches only one thing: buy bravely and consistently, never sell, and you will succeed.</li>

<li><strong>Background</strong>: To provide a new option for retirees who need a stable cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Ticker Introduction</strong>: QQQI (Nasdaq-100 Enhanced Opt &amp; Growth ETF).</li>
<li><strong>Features &amp; Advantages</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>High Dividend</strong>: The dividend yield can reach 12%. For example, an investment of $1 million can generate $120,000 in cash flow per year ($10,000 per month); an investment of $5 million can yield $600,000 per year ($50,000 per month).</li>
<li><strong>Lowers the Retirement Threshold</strong>: For retirees who haven&rsquo;t prepared 25-30 times their annual expenses, investing just 8-10 times their annual expenses in QQQI can generate enough cash flow to cover living costs.</li>
<li><strong>Operational &amp; Tax Advantages</strong>: QQQI distributes dividends derived from a portion of capital gains (from selling appreciated stocks) and income from selling covered call options (about 4-5% annually). For Taiwanese investors using a brokerage with QI (Qualified Intermediary) status (like E.Sun, Yuanta, Cathay, SinoPac, etc.), most of the dividend income, being sourced from capital gains, is eligible for a tax refund. Approximately 96% of the dividends can be refunded.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Act Decisively</strong>: Investors who are still hesitating and haven&rsquo;t entered the market should stop &ldquo;daydreaming.&rdquo; Be &ldquo;ruthless&rdquo; in your actions—immediately sell what you shouldn&rsquo;t hold, buy the correct asset allocation, and then &ldquo;get on the bus and go to sleep.&rdquo; Financial freedom won&rsquo;t be far off.</li>
<li><strong>A House is a Consumer Good, Not an Investment</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve reached a level of wealth where &ldquo;buying a house is like buying a pair of slippers,&rdquo; then buying a luxury home to enjoy life is perfectly fine.</li>
<li>But beware of becoming &ldquo;high-income but exquisitely poor,&rdquo; where your cash flow is extremely tight just to maintain a lavish home. This is akin to buying yourself a giant &ldquo;cage.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>The Correct Sequence</strong>: You should invest first and let your money make money. For example, <strong>if you have $1 million now, first invest it to grow into $200 million, and only then take out $100 million to buy a house.</strong> This way, you can truly enjoy the pleasure of living without being shackled by your property.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Subconscious and Manifestation</strong>: It is recommended to watch a video in the presentation notes that teaches how to connect your subconscious with universal energy. The core principle is to &ldquo;believe&rdquo; first, then meditate in a state of peace, happiness, and love, which makes it easier to manifest your desires.</li>

Scammer IDs (like <code>clecchman</code>) are very similar to the teacher&rsquo;s ID (<code>clecchirman</code>) and use GPT to mimic his tone in private messages. Please be sure to verify by checking follower counts (the teacher has 4.3K followers) and other means.</li>
<li><strong>Book Commentary</strong>: Mentioned that &ldquo;Dr. Huang Pei-Yuan&rsquo;s Bible of Financial Management&rdquo; is a good book, but its sequel, &ldquo;Financial EQ,&rdquo; was likely a cash grab by the publisher with mostly filler content. Reading the first book is sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>Canadian Tax Update</strong>:
<ul>
<li>2025: 50% of capital gains will be included in the year&rsquo;s income.</li>
<li>Starting 2026: For capital gains exceeding C$250,000, 67% of the excess amount will be included in the year&rsquo;s income.</li>
<li>As long as you don&rsquo;t sell, no capital gains tax will be incurred.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing:
<ol>
<li><strong>Regarding QQQI Tax Refund</strong>: Taiwanese investors need to confirm if their brokerage has &ldquo;QI status.&rdquo; If so, they can get a tax refund on their QQQI investment. The method may vary; some brokerages don&rsquo;t withhold tax upfront, while others withhold and then refund it. Most medium to large brokerages have QI status.</li>
<li><strong>The Ease and Persistence of Investing</strong>: Any diligent investment method can make money, but Teacher James&rsquo;s method is the most effortless and worry-free. However, &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, and never sell&rdquo; is easier said than done. It requires personally experiencing severe market volatility (like in 2022) to truly test one&rsquo;s mentality.</li>

<li>Question: With the development of AI, will countries like Vietnam and Indonesia lose the opportunity to transition from labor-intensive to tech-based economies, as Taiwan and South Korea did, and thus be permanently locked at the bottom of the value chain?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This issue is more severe than imagined. The impact of AI is global, not just limited to developing countries. Taiwan&rsquo;s semiconductor industry could also be replaced by fully automated AI factories. The future society will be divided into a tiny minority of capitalists (about 0.1%) and a vast majority of ordinary people (99.9%) dependent on social welfare. The only way out is to become a capitalist—get on board (invest) as soon as possible to enjoy the dividends of this technological revolution. Otherwise, everyone could be left behind by the times.</li>

I also hope my father will invest, but it&rsquo;s hard to convince him. What is your advice?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You are very filial, but you don&rsquo;t need to worry excessively about your father&rsquo;s finances. Right now, <strong>companionship and care are far more important to your father than investment advice.</strong> You should spend more time with him and cherish this period. You can use the NT$6 million loan to invest for yourself, and the returns can be used to support your mother in the future. You don&rsquo;t need to spend excessively on talent classes for your children; playing with them is the best education.</li>

<li>Question: Fubon in Taiwan recently launched a Nasdaq-100 index fund with an &ldquo;automatic dip-buying&rdquo; feature. Can I buy this instead of 00662?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t buy it. It&rsquo;s a mutual fund with extra custodian fees. And you don&rsquo;t need a &ldquo;dip-buying&rdquo; feature; the market is about to rally strongly. If you have money, you should buy 00662 immediately. Don&rsquo;t play around with those complicated, esoteric products.</li>

<li>Question 1: I have initial capital and a monthly salary. Should I DCA monthly, or accumulate for a year and then rebalance according to the 433 strategy?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Buy whenever you have money each month. Don&rsquo;t wait a year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Using the 433 allocation, what should I do with the money borrowed from a stock pledge if I don&rsquo;t need it immediately?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>(Extremely Important Warning!)</strong> If you are in the United States, money borrowed from a pledge <strong>absolutely cannot</strong> be put back into a securities account. The fund flow must be clearly for consumption. A friend has already been asked by Schwab to close their pledge account for this reason, or face a forced sale of stocks to repay the loan. The consequences are severe. If you are not in the US, this amount (at most 2% of assets borrowed annually) is small, so reinvesting it won&rsquo;t have a major impact.</li>

<li><strong>Stocks vs. Real Estate</strong>: After some thought, she concluded that stocks grow through compounding, while real estate&rsquo;s advantage is leverage. However, due to the growth rate difference between stocks (~10%) and real estate (~6%), plus loan interest, the leverage advantage of real estate is depleted after about 7-8 years. After that, the growth curve of stocks will far surpass that of real estate.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Management in China</strong>: In the Chinese stock market, unused cash can earn interest through &ldquo;government bond reverse repos,&rdquo; which can be selected on a daily basis and are very flexible. The interest rates can sometimes be very high before public holidays.</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>The 159509 she bought before is a technology fund, not a Nasdaq-100 index. It&rsquo;s recommended to choose the tickers we suggest.</li>
<li>Since you can tolerate high volatility, you can use a very aggressive allocation: <strong>85% QQQ + 10% QLD + 5% TQQQ</strong>, and rebalance once a year.</li>
<li><strong>Transfer immediately!</strong> Your brokerage&rsquo;s fees are extremely high and it&rsquo;s not safe. Schwab is the best choice—it&rsquo;s secure and commission-free.</li>

<ol>
<li>Sharing: From mainland China, he just discovered the channel last week and felt a sense of &ldquo;sudden enlightenment,&rdquo; with hope for his future. He and his wife had followed the traditional path of buying a house and taking on a mortgage, leading to immense pressure. After listening to the teacher&rsquo;s classes, his mindset completely changed. He no longer frets over grievances at work because he knows he will be wealthy in the future.</li>
<li>Question 1: I have a mortgage (covered by the Housing Provident Fund) and a personal loan. How should I handle them?</li>
<li>Question 2: I have 100,000 RMB available for investment (after setting aside six months of living expenses). Should I allocate it as 80% index / 20% cash?</li>
<li>Question 3: I&rsquo;ve opened a Schwab account and plan to open an account in Hong Kong in the future for pledging. Is this plan feasible?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>Continue to use the Provident Fund for the mortgage. For the personal loan, don&rsquo;t rush to pay off the principal; just pay the interest and use it as a revolving line of credit.</li>
<li>Yes, apply an 80/20 allocation to all your investable assets. The 20% cash can be put into a money market fund.</li>
<li>The plan is excellent. Start transferring some funds to Hong Kong annually now. Once the capital reaches a certain size, you can start pledging. This is a correct ten-year plan. Also, don&rsquo;t be afraid to have a second child because of financial pressure. You will be very wealthy in the future, and having more children will make your family happier.</li>

<p>This quote emphasizes that the prerequisite for long-term investment success is the ability to withstand any market fluctuation without being forced out. Survival is the first element of profit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can buy a house like you buy a pair of slippers—just get another pair if you don&rsquo;t like them—then you can buy one. If you can&rsquo;t be that magnanimous, then a house is just a big cage.

<p>This session began with a very optimistic market forecast (end of QT, influx of capital) and reinforced CLEC&rsquo;s core investment philosophy: <strong>simple, persistent, and brave</strong>. Teacher James not only gave clear instructions—&ldquo;keep buying, don&rsquo;t sell&rdquo;—but also built a solid theoretical foundation from both psychological and strategic standpoints. Whether it was emphasizing the importance of &ldquo;survival,&rdquo; introducing the powerful retirement cash flow tool QQQI, or subverting the traditional concept that &ldquo;a house is a cage,&rdquo; the goal was to help investors establish a correct view of wealth, break free from anxiety, and embark on a relaxed yet firm path to financial freedom. The enthusiastic sharing and questions from the students also provided vivid interpretations and applications of these concepts in real-life situations.</p>

<p>The core of this class revolved around two key points: first, introducing the proper use of the high-dividend ETF <strong>QQQI</strong> for retirees and investors needing cash flow, emphasizing its role as a supplementary cash flow tool rather than a substitute for cash itself; second, through in-depth analysis, clarifying the common misconception about <strong>QQQ (Nasdaq 100 Index)</strong>, pointing out that its investment logic is to &ldquo;invest in the strongest companies of the moment,&rdquo; not limited to the &ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; sector. Teacher James used examples and a historical perspective to explain the dynamic adaptability of the index and reiterated the core investment philosophy of holding for the long term and ignoring market fluctuations.</p>

<li><strong>Market Irrelevance</strong>: Market volatility, international situations, economic data, and company earnings reports are all irrelevant to our investment decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Core Strategy</strong>: The only correct strategy is to &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, hold for the long term, and never sell.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Investment Target</strong>: Do not invest in individual stocks; focus on broad-market index funds to avoid the risks associated with individual company earnings and operations.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Awareness</strong>: The market can drop by 50% or even 80% at any time. Investors must manage their own risk and ensure that the funds invested are for the long term and will not be needed.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: QQQI is suitable for those who are retired or need a stable cash flow, especially when your annual expenses exceed 2.5% of your total assets.</li>
<li><strong>Functional Positioning</strong>: QQQI is a tool to <strong>generate cash flow</strong>, but it <strong>cannot be equated with cash</strong>. Your emergency fund should still be kept in highly liquid assets like money market funds (e.g., 00865B).</li>
<li><strong>Allocation Scenario</strong>: If your retirement assets are less than 40 times your annual expenses (i.e., your withdrawal rate is higher than 2.5%), you can pair it with a portion of QQQI to increase overall cash flow yield to meet living expenses. Young people or investors still in the accumulation phase should continue to invest in growth-oriented index funds like QQQ, 00662, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Practical Application</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In the United States, QQQI can be held in both retirement and individual accounts.</li>
<li>In Taiwan, you can purchase QQQI through a sub-brokerage (such as Yuanta, Fubon, Cathay). Most of the dividends distributed can be reclaimed through tax refunds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Case Study</strong>: A friend of the teacher followed his advice early on, sold his house, and went all-in on QQQ (00662). His assets grew by 1.5 times in five to six years, achieving financial freedom. He now enjoys a high-quality retired life. This stands in stark contrast to those who work their entire lives for a house, a car, and an insurance company.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dispelling the Misconception</strong>: Many believe that investing in QQQ is investing in &ldquo;American high-tech.&rdquo; This is not entirely accurate. Truly pure technology sector funds are like XLK or VGT, but we do not recommend investing in any sector-specific funds.</li>
<li><strong>The Essence of QQQ</strong>: QQQ invests in the <strong>100 strongest companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange</strong>. It is an index without a &ldquo;personality&rdquo;; its only criterion is &ldquo;strength.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Adaptability</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In the current era, the strongest companies happen to be mostly high-tech firms.</li>
<li>However, if we went back 40 years, the strongest companies might have been those making radios, televisions, or trains, and they would have been included in the index. The definition of &ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; changes with the times.</li>
<li>The index also includes companies like Costco and Starbucks, which are not high-tech but are extremely powerful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Core Viewpoint</strong>: We invest in QQQ because we believe that human progress is driven by these strongest companies. We are investing in a <strong>mechanism that dynamically selects the strongest players</strong>, not betting on a specific industry. Obsessing over whether it is a &ldquo;high-tech fund&rdquo; is pointless; what matters is its excellent long-term performance.</li>

<li>Sharing: Discussed the process of stock pledging at HSBC in Hong Kong. She found HSBC&rsquo;s loan-to-value ratios to be relatively conservative (70% for underlying stocks, 90% for cash, leveraged ETFs cannot be pledged), which is lower than in the US or Taiwan.</li>
<li>Question 1: She designed a low-risk allocation of 50% Nasdaq and 50% cash (Beta=0.5), with annual expenses accounting for about 3% of total assets. She wanted to confirm if this approach is safe and whether using the cash portion would create risk. Additionally, she heard that HSBC uses the entire account as collateral, rather than differentiating by asset type, and wanted to verify this.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: The pledging rules at HSBC Hong Kong are identical to those in the US. It&rsquo;s normal for leveraged funds to have no pledge value. She has two options: 1. If taxes are not a concern, she can build a 4-3-3 portfolio within HSBC, buying Hong Kong-listed leveraged ETFs and rebalancing. 2. To avoid domestic capital gains tax, she could, like other students, buy and sell leveraged ETFs through an overseas broker like IBKR, but she must be mindful of potential future US estate tax issues. The teacher emphasized that when you need money, you should &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; from your credit line, not &ldquo;sell assets.&rdquo; A single withdrawal should preferably not exceed 10% of total assets, and always ensure your cash position is greater than your total liabilities; this is very safe.</li>

They could open a joint account; she could open an account in her mother&rsquo;s name, and her mother could sign a Power of Attorney for her to operate it; or she could open it in her name and just share the login details so her mother can view it anytime. The simplest way is to show her the monthly statement and discuss the account&rsquo;s status together.</li>

It is not fixed. The teacher also demonstrated live how to use ChatGPT to calculate asset allocation ratios: by inputting the expected returns of different portfolios (e.g., 2.5% for a 4-3-3 portfolio, 11% for QQQI), the AI can help you calculate the capital proportions needed to achieve a target return rate (e.g., 4% or 6%).</li>

<li>Question: She is a citizen of mainland China but has accounts and funds in mainland China, Hong Kong (Standard Chartered Bank), and IBKR (opened previously in Canada). She feels her asset allocation is chaotic and doesn&rsquo;t know how to distribute it.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: First, as a Chinese tax resident, it is not advisable to keep large assets in IBKR due to the risk of US estate tax; the funds should be consolidated into a Hong Kong account as soon as possible. Second, it&rsquo;s important to distinguish between &ldquo;margin financing&rdquo; at mainland brokers (borrowing money to buy stocks, cash cannot be withdrawn) and &ldquo;stock pledging&rdquo; at Hong Kong banks (collateralizing stocks to borrow cash for spending). He advised her to keep about 1 year of living expenses in China, 2-3 years of cash in Hong Kong, and invest the majority of the remaining funds in the Nasdaq 100 index. She could allocate a small portion (e.g., 10%) to a 2x leveraged ETF since she is still young and not yet retired.</li>

<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This is most likely because she agreed to the user agreement upon registration, which included a clause allowing the platform to use her data for internal marketing.

<li>Question: She made an operational error during a trade.

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Absolutely not! In investing, once you make an operational mistake, you must correct it immediately and get back on your original planned track.

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes, you must adhere strictly. You absolutely cannot act based on short-term market fluctuations, or you will become a short-term trader. The discipline is to operate only once a year, pick a time (like December or January), get it done, and then you are finished until the next year.

<li>Question 2: She currently has an IBKR account in Canada. After opening an HSBC account, should she keep both accounts and operate them in parallel?

This &ldquo;leg&rdquo; is a &ldquo;lame leg&rdquo; that will need to be &ldquo;amputated&rdquo; sooner or later, so it&rsquo;s better to deal with it now.

She calculated that the future rent would be about the same as her current mortgage payment, but her living space would shrink to one-third of its original size.

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a matter of changing your perspective. By selling the house, you gain a large sum of cash to invest, which means your assets start working for you. A smaller living space means a simpler life, less cleaning, and you can spend your time and money on improving experiences. More importantly, this is a short-term &ldquo;sacrifice.&rdquo; Five or ten years from now, when your invested assets have doubled or grown, you can use the returns to rent a much larger and more luxurious place than the one you sold. This isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;enduring hardship&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s &ldquo;taking nourishment&rdquo; for the sake of exponential future freedom.</li>

In the long run, QQQ&rsquo;s annualized return will reach 15% or even higher. Investors need to have critical thinking skills.

The brand new, high-quality hotel she stayed in locally cost only about $100 USD per night, proving that without being tied down by property, one can live very well all over the world.

<li>Question 1: She works in China and lives in Singapore and wanted to confirm her investment strategy. Should she adopt a leveraged strategy of 60% QQQ + 20% pledge + 20% cash, or since she still has an income, should she go all-in on QQQ and invest a fixed amount monthly?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: For an investor who is new to this concept and unfamiliar with stock pledging, it is recommended to use a simpler method: keep one to two years of living expenses as cash, and with the rest of the money, &ldquo;buy whenever you have money&rdquo; in QQQ. Do not engage in pledging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Her child is 6 years old, and in Singapore&rsquo;s highly competitive environment, she feels very anxious. On one hand, she wants her child to become elite, but on the other, she feels that in the age of AI, children should be allowed to grow up happily.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: A 6-year-old child doesn&rsquo;t need to learn anything; their only job is to play. Don&rsquo;t worry about &ldquo;losing at the starting line&rdquo;; in both investing and life, you need to &ldquo;win at the finish line.&rdquo; Forcing a child to learn will not lead to success. You should take your child to experience the world (travel, museums, libraries) and let him discover his own interests. With hundreds of millions in assets, are you worried your child won&rsquo;t have food to eat? Letting him develop naturally is the best way.</li>

<li>Question: He once again raised concerns about selling his house. He calculated his situation and believes that after selling the house, the principal invested in QQQ would need five to six years of &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; to double, by which time he might not even be able to buy back his current house.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This is classic short-sightedness. The teacher did a 30-year calculation for him on the spot: assume he sells his house now and gets back 180,000 in principal, with the house valued at 300,000. In 30 years, at a 6% annualized growth rate, the house will be worth 1.7 million. But the 180,000 principal invested in QQQ, at a 15% annualized return, will become 12 million in 30 years. 1.7 million versus 12 million, which one do you choose? The so-called &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; is your own imagination. Renting can offer more freedom; you can rent a luxury apartment with a swimming pool and gym, and your quality of life might even be higher.</li>

<li>Sharing: She discovered that flipping &ldquo;pre-construction properties&rdquo; in Singapore offers very high returns. With a 25% down payment, the profit from the property&rsquo;s appreciation in three to four years can exceed the principal, making the short-term return rate seem higher than QQQ&rsquo;s.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: If you don&rsquo;t believe it, you can go and try. But buying and selling property has transaction costs (6%) and taxes. Many people have already suffered this loss; buying a house will keep you poor for a lifetime. If you want to verify it for yourself, then go ahead.</li>

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: No! Absolutely do not do this. You can&rsquo;t possibly invest 100,000 and expect to borrow 100,000 back; the risk is extremely high. Moreover, your allocation is 80% bonds, which has a very low Beta and poor returns. It&rsquo;s not worth borrowing money for at all.</li>

<p>This session was rich in content and highly practical. Teacher James not only clearly defined the applicable scope of the tool QQQI, helping those planning for retirement to better construct their cash flow, but also once again clarified the fundamental investment logic of QQQ, strengthening everyone&rsquo;s confidence in long-term holding. The Q&amp;A interaction was particularly brilliant, ranging from specific cross-border account management to profound analyses of investment psychology. The repeated debates on &ldquo;selling a house to invest&rdquo; were especially notable, where the teacher, through firm logic and highly persuasive metaphors, helped students overcome the fear and doubt associated with transitioning from traditional concepts to a modern investment mindset. The entire discussion emphasized the critical role of discipline, critical thinking, and a long-term perspective for investment success.</p>

By contrasting the vast difference between borrowing for consumption versus spending principal, he explains the wealth-magnifying effect of using leverage wisely. Additionally, for retirees and near-retirees, he stresses the core role of maintaining a cash flow reserve for over 15 years. Through two real-life family financial case studies, he analyzes the pitfalls of bank-offered wealth management products and how to make safer, smarter asset allocations for elders and oneself.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<lite-youtube videoid="XIN4vZYlGFc" playlabel="XIN4vZYlGFc" params=""></lite-youtube>

<p>The core of this session is to build an <strong>&ldquo;antifragile&rdquo;</strong> investment system. Teacher James points out that true financial freedom comes not from predicting the market, but from establishing a robust structure that can withstand and even benefit from market changes. This includes cultivating a long-term mindset that &ldquo;the market has no top, it will only go higher,&rdquo; and understanding that the permanent loss of missing out on gains is far greater than the risk of temporary downturns. Through specific examples and calculations, the teacher demonstrates the immense impact of using leverage wisely (such as credit loans, stock pledges) versus spending down principal on long-term wealth. He also provides clear guidance on cash reserves and asset allocation for different life stages, especially for those approaching retirement, aiming to help everyone evolve their investment cognition and achieve true financial security and freedom.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fearlessness Towards Market Volatility</strong>: Market shocks and international situations are irrelevant to long-term investors. The market has no peak; it will continuously set new highs. The biggest risk for an investor is not a short-term decline, but missing out on long-term growth due to hesitation, the latter being a permanent loss.</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Snowball Effect&rdquo; of Investing</strong>: The essence of Warren Buffett&rsquo;s &ldquo;long runway and thick snow&rdquo; is persistence. The initial years of investing (the first 4-5 years) may not show significant results, which is the most difficult stage. But once the asset &ldquo;snowball&rdquo; grows larger, the subsequent growth is astonishing. The key is to adhere to the principle of &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, and never sell,&rdquo; regardless of market conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of Scams</strong>: The teacher once again called out a scam account with the ID &ldquo;Pan,&rdquo; which impersonates him to contact students privately and has very few subscribers (35). The teacher emphasized that he would never initiate private contact with anyone, and any unsolicited contact offering managed account services is a scam.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Definition of &ldquo;Antifragility&rdquo;</strong>: Antifragility refers to a system&rsquo;s ability not only to withstand risks but also to benefit from drastic environmental changes and disasters.</li>
<li><strong>The Fragility of Professions</strong>: Many seemingly stable, high-paying professions, such as engineers and doctors, are actually fragile. The more specialized a profession, the harder it is to transition. Once a disruptive change occurs in the industry (like the emergence of AI), they may face the risk of unemployment.</li>
<li><strong>Investing is the Ultimate Antifragility</strong>: In contrast, capital is antifragile. It works 24/7 and cannot be fired. Therefore, everyone should evolve through investing to possess the ability to withstand unknown risks. The biggest risk in investing is &ldquo;the risk of not knowing that risk exists.&rdquo;</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Thought Experiment</strong>: Assume you have a principal of $5 million with an 18% annualized return over 40 years.
<ol>
<li><strong>Borrowing for Consumption Model</strong>: Borrow $100,000 annually for living expenses at a 6% interest rate. After 40 years, the $5 million principal will grow to $375 million, while the total debt will be approximately $16 million. The final net worth would be a staggering <strong>$359 million</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Spending Principal Model</strong>: Spend $100,000 from the principal each year. After 40 years, the assets will only grow to <strong>$189 million</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In the long run, those who borrow to spend have nearly double the assets of those who spend their principal. The longer the time frame, the larger the gap. This reflects the hierarchical difference between being &ldquo;tycoon-level rich&rdquo; and merely &ldquo;wealthy.&rdquo; For young people, using credit to invest (like &ldquo;Han Xin gathering his troops&rdquo;) could add an extra hundred million to their future assets.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Case One: The Trap of a NT$300 Million Land Plot</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: Land inherited from an elder appreciated to NT$300 million, but the family had no cash flow. A bank stepped in and designed a complex financial plan: mortgage the land for a NT$170 million loan, use part of the funds to buy high-risk bonds from an Arabian oil company, then pledge the bonds, set up a trust, have the brothers take out another NT$30 million loan, etc., in a layered structure.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: The entire family was trapped by the bank&rsquo;s scheme, burdened with huge debts, yet still generated no cash flow. Their assets faced a massive risk of being hollowed out by the bank.</li>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Advice</strong>: Immediately terminate the cooperation with the bank and redeem everything. The simplest and most direct method is for the elder to sell the land to a developer and get NT$300 million in cash. After taxes, there would still be about NT$200 million in liquid assets. This money could be allocated as 70% stocks and 30% cash. This would not only generate cash flow but also allow for easy handling of inheritance tax in the future through &ldquo;in-kind payment,&rdquo; avoiding being exploited by the bank layer by layer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Case Two: Financial Planning for a Near-Retiree</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: A 62-year-old friend with a mortgage-free house, NT$40 million in cash (later clarified to have total assets of NT$60 million), and annual expenses of NT$1 million, was considering a &ldquo;Wealth Management Mortgage&rdquo; (Home Equity Loan) for investment.</li>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Advice</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Strongly Opposed</strong>: For those near or in retirement, borrowing with a short-term wealth management mortgage (e.g., renewed every 2-5 years) is extremely risky. If the bank refuses to renew the loan and demands repayment during a market downturn, it would lead to catastrophic consequences.</li>
<li><strong>The Only Exception</strong>: If you must take out a loan, it must be a long-term one with a contract period of at least 15 years (for example, some banks like DBS offer loans until age 75). This is because a 15-year cycle is long enough for the market to recover from any low point.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion for This Case</strong>: The friend has NT$60 million in assets and annual expenses of NT$1 million, resulting in a withdrawal rate of only 1.67%. This is entirely sufficient for living; there is absolutely no need to take the risk of borrowing. If you have enough money, don&rsquo;t borrow. If you don&rsquo;t have enough, you shouldn&rsquo;t borrow either. Older individuals should prioritize being conservative.</li>

A project suspension last year gave her a lot of free time, during which she began exploring personal and spiritual growth and was introduced to basic financial knowledge.</li>
<li>She believes the biggest change was a &ldquo;shift in thought.&rdquo; Teacher James&rsquo;s philosophy, &ldquo;Wealth is a birthright, happiness is a human right,&rdquo; first requires establishing a new belief system. Many people don&rsquo;t believe ordinary individuals can achieve financial freedom because their old beliefs limit them.</li>
<li>She observed that the mentality of seeking quick results through short-term trading is rooted in the same &ldquo;sense of scarcity&rdquo; as the anxiety of rushing to find a job and being unable to tolerate career gaps. Stepping back and slowing down, however, can lead to more valuable methods.</li>
<li>After accepting the mindset that &ldquo;I am already a millionaire,&rdquo; she found her words and actions became more composed, and she no longer felt a sense of material lack. She believes that before learning the specific operational details, it is crucial to first mentally accept that one can be &ldquo;both wealthy and free.&rdquo;</li>

<li>He started following the teacher&rsquo;s lessons around 2019-2020. At the time, he believed in the philosophy but didn&rsquo;t have much capital. He owned three rental properties in the US, which had low cash flow and soaring maintenance costs after the pandemic.</li>
<li>Inspired by the teacher&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;selling the houses,&rdquo; he made a firm decision and sold all three properties within 22 months. Although he paid a substantial amount in capital gains tax, he viewed tax as a cost and felt a sense of relief after selling.</li>
<li>He invested the proceeds into a brokerage account, not getting bogged down in precise calculations but following the principle of being &ldquo;vaguely right.&rdquo; Last December, while traveling, he casually checked his account and was astonished to find his assets had reached 50 times his annual expenses. He decided to officially retire this year.</li>
<li>His takeaways are: be patient, as the market is generous; dare to sell rental properties; and continue learning, because the teacher&rsquo;s instruction is also constantly evolving.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: The market is very generous. For someone like Li with a solid foundation, five years of serious investing can be enough to retire. For young people starting from scratch, they can be well-off in ten years, wealthy in twenty, and tycoons in thirty. Real estate is like being a &ldquo;slave in a shell&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s a shackle that shouldn&rsquo;t be carried.</li>

<li>Question: He shared backtesting data on an &ldquo;elastic rebalancing&rdquo; strategy. The strategy involves, when cash reserves are less than 15 years, not using cash in a down year but instead converting a portion of a standard ETF (like QQQ) into a leveraged ETF. In an up year, a portion of the leveraged ETF is converted back to cash. His conclusion was that the backtest didn&rsquo;t reveal a single optimal parameter. The most stable strategy remains, at the start of retirement for a given Beta value, to allocate the highest possible percentage to cash.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The conclusion is correct. For the same Beta value, always choose the allocation with the higher cash percentage. Rebalancing should be &ldquo;vaguely right,&rdquo; not overly precise. When the market is doing well, move more profits into cash to &ldquo;build your fortress walls higher&rdquo; to defend against future risks.</li>

<li>He has been practicing &ldquo;Han Xin gathering his troops&rdquo; by investing with credit loans and is currently approaching the credit limit in Taiwan.</li>

<li>Question: His mother is expected to have about NT$10 million after selling her house. Her annual expenses are not high, but the amount isn&rsquo;t sufficient to support living off a pledged loan. How should this money be allocated for his mother&rsquo;s living expenses? Is it feasible to invest it all in a high-dividend ETF like 0056?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I recommend keeping NT$1 million as an emergency fund and investing the remaining NT$9 million entirely into 0056. Assuming a 6% dividend yield, that&rsquo;s NT$540,000 a year, or NT$45,000 a month, which is much higher than rental income. This way, the elder has money to spend, feels secure, and will be happier and live longer. Moreover, converting real estate into liquid assets will make handling inheritance much simpler in the future.</li>

<li>Shared her personal practice: she refinanced her house with a 30-year loan when interest rates were low and opened a HELOC as a temporary emergency cash reserve. She also once rented out a spare room to an international student to increase cash flow.</li>

<li>Question: A 60-year-old friend has NT$7.5 million in cash and NT$18 million in high-dividend ETFs (yielding NT$1.6 million annually). Annual living expenses are NT$2 million. They are considering a 70/30 or 433 allocation and using a NT$7 million line of credit from a wealth management mortgage.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Absolutely not. First, your assets are insufficient to support NT$2 million in annual spending. At a 6% dividend yield, you would need a NT$33 million principal to generate NT$2 million in cash flow; your total assets are only NT$25.5 million. Second, you are already 60 years old; you absolutely must not use a wealth management mortgage, the risk is too high. Your only option is to keep about NT$1.5 million in cash and invest the remaining NT$24 million entirely into a high-dividend ETF like 0056. Live off the dividends, and spend only what you have.</li>

Furthermore, when he does rebalance, he feels internal conflict, thinking, &ldquo;What if the market keeps going up?&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This method is not complex at all; what&rsquo;s complex is your mind. You struggle because &ldquo;your mind abides in something&rdquo; (心有所住), clinging to potential outcomes, which &ldquo;gives rise to inner demons&rdquo; (心生魔障). The solution is spiritual practice, to achieve a state where you can &ldquo;let the mind arise without abiding anywhere.&rdquo; This is just simple arithmetic; do what needs to be done.</li>

<p>&ldquo;Downturns are always temporary; only uptrends are forever. So your loss might be momentary&hellip; but if you miss out on the gains, that&rsquo;s a permanent loss.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This view emphasizes that in long-term investing, the opportunity cost (missing the upside) is far more detrimental than the paper losses from short-term market corrections.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The more specialized your profession, the more fragile you are&hellip; The only thing that is antifragile is investing.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This view explains the concept of &ldquo;antifragility,&rdquo; pointing out that highly specialized careers are very risky in the face of industry disruption, whereas capital investment has the inherent ability to continuously adapt to change.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The unfolding of our lives is actually based on our own mindset. Whatever you believe the world to be, that is what it will become for you.&rdquo;
&ndash; Mao Mao</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This insight shares the importance of personal mindset transformation, suggesting that believing you can be wealthy is the first step toward achieving financial freedom.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay in a broken elevator. We need to find a good one.&rdquo;
&ndash; TBOS (quoting Teacher James)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This metaphor illustrates that in investing, one should decisively abandon underperforming individual stocks (the broken elevator) and move to index funds with long-term upward trends (the good elevator).</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Tax is not the point. The point is that the assets should be able to appreciate, and the elders should be able to spend the money.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This point, made when discussing how to handle elders&rsquo; assets, suggests that the core goals should be increasing asset value and improving the elders&rsquo; quality of life, rather than being overly fixated on potential future inheritance taxes.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Because your mind abides in something, your mind is attached, and thus demons will arise.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This view responds to a student&rsquo;s concern about strategy complexity from a philosophical perspective, pointing out that fear and indecision in investing stem from internal attachments, not from the strategy itself.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The house collapses, but the mortgage payments continue.&rdquo;
&ndash; Fu You Shi Tian Fu &amp; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This statement, drawn from a real disaster case, reveals the immense risk of real estate as an asset. Not only can its value drop to zero, but the associated debt does not disappear with it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Usually, people who say they don&rsquo;t keep cash are the poor ones&hellip; Cash is air.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This vivid analogy emphasizes the critical importance of cash reserves for investment survival, especially in retirement planning, where it serves as a lifeline against risk.</p></blockquote>

<p>This gathering provided a deep dive into the core elements of building an &ldquo;antifragile&rdquo; investment system. From macro-level mindset to specific operational tactics, Teacher James once again stressed the belief and discipline required for long-term investing. By comparing the case of borrowing for consumption versus spending principal, he clearly illustrated the vast difference in wealth growth paths. For investors at different stages, especially near-retirees, the teacher offered prudent advice on cash reserves and loan risks, using two vivid family financial cases to expose the traps and enlightened paths in the financial market. The students&rsquo; sharings were also exceptionally insightful, ranging from transformations in personal journeys and the practical application of selling property to invest, to the integration of Zen meditation with investment philosophy, fully demonstrating the community members&rsquo; shared growth in both wealth and spirit. The entire discussion was not just a lesson in investment strategy but a profound exchange on life planning and spiritual cultivation.</p>

<p>This session delves into multiple dimensions of investment and wealth. The core ideas revolve around three &ldquo;Seven Levels&rdquo; theories:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Seven Levels of Investment Learning</strong>: The journey from initial exposure to forming an unwavering belief.</li>
<li><strong>The Seven Levels of Wealth Accumulation</strong>: The path from understanding investment to maximizing wealth through concentration, leverage, tax savings, and longevity.</li>
<li><strong>The Seven Levels of Investment Operations</strong>: From the confusion of short-term trading to finally embracing the wealthy class strategy of &ldquo;invest only in indexes, never sell, and live off pledged assets.&rdquo;

<li><strong>Ignore Short-Term Volatility</strong>: The market has been highly volatile recently due to events like US-China tariffs and a potential US government shutdown, but investors should ignore this market noise and avoid making incorrect moves. Typically, any action based on short-term predictions is wrong.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Technical Analysis</strong>: The accuracy of technical analysis is about the same as a coin toss, roughly 50/50, and should not be the primary basis for investment decisions.</li>

<li><strong>AI Makes the Impossible Possible, But Also Makes People Busier</strong>: Technological advancements like AI have made things previously unimaginable (such as quickly creating multilingual videos) possible. However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean people become more idle; on the contrary, they become busier because there are more things they can do.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage Using AI to Spread Correct Investment Philosophies</strong>: Students can use AI tools like NotebookLM or ChatGPT to translate investment philosophies into articles or videos in different languages, helping to &ldquo;inform&rdquo; more people of their right to be wealthy.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Philosophy is Evolving DNA</strong>: Our investment philosophy is constantly evolving and being optimized. For example, it was once emphasized that those who pledge assets &ldquo;must&rdquo; allocate to leveraged funds to maintain returns. The current view, however, is that for the sake of stability, one can pledge assets without holding leveraged funds. Students need to keep up with their learning to avoid sticking to outdated knowledge, as the investment world is like biological evolution—ceasing to evolve risks being eliminated.</li>

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Seven Levels of Investment Learning</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hearing</strong>: Just encountering the information, possibly thinking it&rsquo;s a scam.</li>
<li><strong>Knowing</strong>: Beginning to realize there&rsquo;s substance to it.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding</strong>: Developing cognition after in-depth research.</li>
<li><strong>Believing</strong>: Transitioning from cognition to trust.</li>
<li><strong>Executing</strong>: Putting belief into action, the key being &ldquo;buy when you have money, immediately, at market price.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Enduring</strong>: Being able to withstand the pain and hold on when the market drops by 40% or even more.</li>
<li><strong>Faith</strong>: Reaching a state of inner peace where market fluctuations don&rsquo;t matter. This is usually built on proper asset allocation and sufficient cash flow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Seven Levels of Wealth (Differences in Magnitude)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knowing How to Invest vs. Not Knowing</strong>: This is the first dividing line, separating 90% of the world&rsquo;s population.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Correctly vs. Incorrectly</strong>: Among those who know how to invest, choosing the most efficient assets (e.g., QQQ vs. VOO/VT) can result in a hundredfold difference in assets over the long term.</li>
<li><strong>Han Xin Deploying Troops (Concentrating Capital)</strong>: Concentrating funds in the highest-return assets instead of diversifying into inefficient products like insurance, annuities, and bonds can create another hundredfold gap in assets.</li>
<li><strong>Pledging and Borrowing</strong>: Learning to use stock pledging to obtain liquidity instead of selling assets widens the asset gap again.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing Without Repaying</strong>: Understanding that a pledge loan is an expansion of assets, not a traditional debt that needs to be repaid. Compared to those who rush to repay, the potential for wealth growth is entirely different.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Tax Savings</strong>: Through legal tax planning (like Roth Conversions in the US), one can save enormous amounts in taxes, further widening the wealth gap.</li>
<li><strong>Longevity</strong>: When all the above are done correctly, the longer you live, the more significant the compounding effect, and the more assets you accumulate. Longevity is the key determinant of ultimate wealth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Seven Levels of Investment Operations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level One</strong>: New to the market, occasionally making money on individual stocks, thinking investing is easy.</li>
<li><strong>Level Two</strong>: Trying derivatives like options, possibly profiting in the short term, but likely losing money in the long run.</li>
<li><strong>Level Three</strong>: Starting to study financial reports and industry trends, trying to buy low and sell high, but the more you know, the more you lose.</li>
<li><strong>Level Four</strong>: Obsessed with technical analysis and futures, engaging in frantic short-term trading, thinking you&rsquo;re a stock market guru, but actually being closest to bankruptcy.</li>
<li><strong>Level Five</strong>: Understanding that investing is about sharing in a company&rsquo;s growth and knowing how to pick good companies, but still suffering from the huge volatility of individual stocks. You work like a dog for mediocre returns.</li>
<li><strong>Level Six</strong>: Grasping the power of long-term holding and starting to make big profits, but still needing to constantly research and switch companies. Having cash on hand after selling becomes a new source of anxiety. It&rsquo;s still a busy operational life.</li>
<li><strong>Level Seven (The Ultimate)</strong>: Investing only in index funds (QQQ). Buy whenever you have money, never sell, buy with your eyes closed. Implement proper asset allocation (e.g., 433), keep enough cash, and fear no market crash. Live off loans from stock pledging and never repay them, allowing assets to continuously generate wealth. This is the true wealthy class.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Astonishing Power of Compounding</strong>: Using the example of investing NT$10,000 per month, at an 18% annualized return, it can grow to NT$547 million in 40 years. This shows that becoming wealthy is achievable for ordinary people; it is a &ldquo;God-given&rdquo; right. The key is whether one is informed and takes action.</li>
<li><strong>The Nature of Work and the Meaning of Life</strong>: Our lives should not be solely for work and survival. Viewing one&rsquo;s job as the entirety of life is a form of enslavement by capitalism. Only after being free from work pressure can one truly understand what &ldquo;life&rdquo; is and pursue what one loves, like gardening or enjoying a pastoral life.</li>
<li><strong>The Risks of Leveraged ETFs</strong>: One must deeply understand the nature of leveraged ETFs (like TQQQ). They can bring tenfold returns in the short term but can also drop to zero (a 99.999% decline) in a single major crash. Therefore, their risk must be managed through asset allocation and rebalancing; never go all-in.</li>

<li>Share: She recently heard a story that Tony Robbins suggests two things for success: first, imitate someone you want to become; second, practice positive meditation daily. She applied this to herself by imitating James, practicing the seven levels of investing step-by-step—from understanding investing and doing it right to pledging assets without repayment—and believes she is on the right path. She also mentioned that Taiwan&rsquo;s inheritance tax is very low.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He agrees that Taiwan&rsquo;s inheritance tax is low (maximum 20%), so there&rsquo;s no need for complex trusts or planning. The best &ldquo;tax avoidance&rdquo; is to &ldquo;have many children and grandchildren&rdquo; and use the annual gift tax exemption to transfer wealth to future generations early, which has an amazing compounding effect. He shared a cautionary tale of a bank deceiving a family into taking out a massive loan to &ldquo;plan&rdquo; for inheritance tax, warning that bank promotions can sometimes be scams.</li>

<li>Share: He has opened Custodial Accounts for his three young children, with a portfolio of 60% QQQ, 20% QLD, and 20% SGOV. He plans to invest small amounts regularly. His goal is not to give them a certain amount of money but to &ldquo;teach them how to fish,&rdquo; allowing them to see the account grow from a young age and giving him the opportunity to teach them the complete financial system in the future, including Pledge Loans. This is both a transfer of wealth and wisdom.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He strongly agrees with this educational approach. He pointed out that gifting early is the best estate planning. For example, giving a daughter $20,000 annually for 40 years could grow to nearly $100 billion at an 18% return, completely tax-free, which is far more significant than worrying about the inheritance tax exemption amount.</li>

<li><strong>Han Xin Deploying Troops</strong>: Following James&rsquo;s advice, he canceled unnecessary investment-linked insurance policies, sold an idle property in Taiwan to invest in US index funds, and did not rush to pay off his mortgage. These three decisions significantly improved his financial situation.</li>
<li><strong>Evolution of Investment Philosophy</strong>: He recalled that he initially only learned to &ldquo;Buy and Hold SPY,&rdquo; which was just 1/5 of the entire system.

<li>Question: Regarding the Traditional IRA, some suggest holding cash in it so the future tax base is low. But she thought if she put it all in QQQ, although the future tax would be higher, the growth would also be much higher than cash. Isn&rsquo;t that better?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a balance between risk and taxes. James provided a strategy: suppose you convert $100,000 to a Roth account annually. You could buy $100,000 of TQQQ (3x leverage) in the Roth. To balance the risk of the entire portfolio, you could hold $200,000 in cash in your Traditional IRA. This way, your high-growth component (TQQQ) is in the tax-free Roth account, while the cash in the Traditional IRA hedges the risk. This optimizes the tax structure without reducing the overall return potential.</li>

The friend initially claimed she could tolerate a 50% fluctuation, but when told the loss could last for 3-5 years, she immediately said she couldn&rsquo;t accept it; her bottom line was not losing principal for more than 1-2 years. Through this conversation, Ling deeply realized that everyone&rsquo;s definition of and tolerance for &ldquo;risk&rdquo; is completely different. Before taking any investment action (like buying immediately at market price), the first task is to thoroughly understand what level of risk you can truly bear.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He highly praised Ling&rsquo;s clear logic. He emphasized that knowing your own risk tolerance is the first step in investing, more important than any strategy. He used the 2000 dot-com bubble as an example, where QQQ took 15 years to return to its high, which is why he recommends keeping enough cash for 15-20 years. <strong>&ldquo;Survival is more important than making money.&rdquo;</strong> Before you understand yourself, you should keep more cash; the rate of return is not the top priority.</li>

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He acknowledged that this trend is real. However, he offered several counterpoints: 1. The US debt problem could be resolved by productivity gains from AI (e.g., an extra 1.5% GDP growth annually). 2. A thought experiment: If the US government announced a &ldquo;ban on using US dollars for gold transactions,&rdquo; the entire dollar-denominated gold market would collapse instantly, and the value of gold hoarded by countries would plummet. The US has many tools left in its toolbox to maintain its hegemony. The disputes between the US and China over chips and rare earths are games between nations and do not affect our long-term confidence in US technological development, which is unrelated to investing in QQQ.</li>

Background: When discussing the impact of AI, James pointed out that AI is a tool that expands the boundaries of our capabilities, resulting in us being able to do, and wanting to do, more things, rather than making us idle.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A person doesn&rsquo;t know what it is to be human until they are without a job. That is what you call a &rsquo;life.'
&ndash; James
Background: In explaining his life philosophy, James criticized the idea of &ldquo;living to work,&rdquo; believing that only by breaking free from the shackles of work can one truly experience and understand the meaning of life.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Survival is more important than making money.
&ndash; James
Background: When commenting on Ling&rsquo;s case study about risk perception, James emphasized that survival is the first principle of investing. Managing risk and keeping sufficient cash is far more important than chasing short-term high returns.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s understanding of risk can be completely different&hellip; You must first figure out what you consider to be risk before you allocate your assets.
&ndash; Ling
Background: Ling shared her experience helping a novice investor friend and discovered a huge gap between the friend&rsquo;s stated risk tolerance and her actual psychological bottom line, leading to this conclusion.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AI will confidently spout nonsense&hellip; In the world today, there is some information&hellip; that is prone to this kind of mutual contamination.
&ndash; Julia
Background: Julia shared her pitfalls when using AI to research complex tax issues, finding that AI and incorrect online information form a vicious cycle, mutually citing and amplifying errors.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Invest only in index funds, buy whenever you have money and never sell, buy with your eyes closed&hellip; Do your asset allocation&hellip; live off loans from stock pledging, and never repay them.
&ndash; James
Background: When summarizing the seventh and highest level of investment operations, James used this phrase to encapsulate the essence of the strategy for achieving ultimate financial freedom.</p></blockquote>

<p>This session was a systematic and in-depth review of investment philosophy and life-wealth concepts. Through a clear, three-tiered &ldquo;seven-level ladder&rdquo; model, James constructed a complete growth blueprint for listeners, from investment novice to wealthy magnate. The course not only taught &ldquo;what to do&rdquo; (invest in indexes, don&rsquo;t sell, use pledging wisely) but also profoundly explained &ldquo;why to do it&rdquo; (understand risk, ignore noise, believe in compounding) and the ultimate goal (achieve freedom in life, not be enslaved by work). The students&rsquo; sharing and questions—from practical operations to macroeconomics and the critical use of AI tools—greatly enriched the breadth and depth of the discussion, once again confirming that investment success ultimately stems from continuous learning, deep self-awareness, and a firm philosophical belief.</p>

<p>The core theme of this session is <strong>constructing a robust asset allocation strategy for retired or near-retired individuals with &lsquo;survival&rsquo; as the primary goal</strong>. The central idea is that financial planning in retirement should prioritize the stability and longevity of cash flow over maximizing investment returns. Teacher James explains in detail how to set the portfolio&rsquo;s risk exposure (Beta value) based on different levels of cash reserves (30%, 40%, 50%) and, accordingly, determine a safe annual withdrawal rate. The aim is to ensure one can weather even extreme market conditions, such as a 15-year-long bear market.</p>

<li><strong>Beware of Scams</strong>: Recent online scams remain rampant, such as videos using AI to imitate the voices of figures like Jensen Huang, luring users into groups with offers of free books or ChatGPT tutorials for fraudulent purposes. Teacher James shared that even his own father received a scam text message claiming his &ldquo;phone had been hacked,&rdquo; reminding everyone not to click on unknown links. Important institutions like the government and banks typically communicate via mail rather than phone calls.</li>
<li><strong>Identifying Fake Accounts</strong>: After recommending &ldquo;阿良正传的人生&rdquo; (A-Liang&rsquo;s True Story of Life) last week, some students mistakenly followed a fake Facebook account set up by scammers.

<p>Teacher James proposed three cash-based asset allocation models for retirees with different financial situations and risk tolerances:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>30% Cash Allocation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highest Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 1.0)</strong>: The remaining 70% of assets can be allocated as 40% in an index fund (like QQQ) and 30% in a leveraged fund (like TQQQ).</li>
<li><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate</strong>: With this allocation, a maximum of <strong>2%</strong> of total assets can be withdrawn annually for living expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.7)</strong>: If the portfolio consists of 70% in an index fund with no leverage, the withdrawal rate can be increased to <strong>3%</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: The higher the asset volatility, the lower the withdrawal rate must be to prevent excessive asset depletion during a market downturn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>40% Cash Allocation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.9)</strong>: The remaining 60% of assets can be allocated with a maximum of 30% in an index fund and 30% in a leveraged fund.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate</strong>: With this allocation, a maximum of <strong>3%</strong> can be withdrawn annually.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.6)</strong>: If the portfolio is 40% index and 20% leveraged, the withdrawal rate can be increased to <strong>4%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>50% Cash Allocation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.7)</strong>: The remaining 50% of assets can be allocated with a maximum of 30% in an index fund and 20% in a leveraged fund.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate</strong>: With this allocation, <strong>4%</strong> can be withdrawn annually.</li>
<li><strong>No-Leverage Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.5)</strong>: If the allocation is 50% cash and 50% index fund, the withdrawal rate can be increased to <strong>5%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ultimate Goal: 15 Years of Cash Reserves</strong>
<ul>
<li>The most ideal state is to hold enough cash at a market high to cover living expenses for the next 15 years. Considering that cash itself earns interest (e.g., 3.5%), one might only need to prepare 12-13 years&rsquo; worth of principal to last for 15 years.</li>
<li>If this cannot be achieved initially, cash can be gradually accumulated through rebalancing when the market goes up until the 15-year goal is met or exceeded.</li>
<li>Only when cash reserves exceed 15 years of living expenses can the surplus be used to buy the dip during a market downturn, ensuring that &ldquo;survival&rdquo; remains the top priority.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investing is Learned, Not Taught</strong>: James quotes the concept of &ldquo;The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao,&rdquo; emphasizing that investment philosophy must be personally contemplated, understood, and practiced to be truly internalized. Like riding a bicycle, no amount of reading can replace getting on the bike and trying. He encourages everyone to use their hands and minds to explore and comprehend for themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Rethinking Stock Pledging</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Evolution of Concept</strong>: In the past, to avoid sacrificing returns by holding cash (used for pledging), it was recommended to pair it with leveraged funds. Now, the emphasis is more on &ldquo;stability&rdquo; and &ldquo;survival.&rdquo; Therefore, even without chasing the highest returns, a no-leverage portfolio of 50% cash and 50% index fund can still be used for a pledged-asset line of credit.</li>
<li><strong>Pledging Risk Warning</strong>: The teacher used an example to explain why even a seemingly low borrowing ratio (e.g., 10%) could lead to bankruptcy. Suppose you borrow $100,000 against $1 million in assets. During a prolonged bear market of 10 years (like 2000-2009, when the market fell 85%), the $100,000 loan plus interest could grow to $160,000, while your assets might shrink to just $150,000, at which point you would be insolvent. This highlights the importance of holding sufficient cash (e.g., 30%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow is the Lifeline</strong>: An anecdote about an individual with over 100 million TWD in assets who fell into a cash flow crisis after buying a 75 million TWD mansion serves as a warning that regardless of asset size, a lack of cash flow management can lead to bankruptcy risk.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: She started listening to the teacher&rsquo;s classes in April 2021. Although she&rsquo;s a slow learner, she has saved $100,000 in the past 20 months despite a modest salary, which makes her very surprised and happy. She has already reduced her portfolio&rsquo;s Beta from 1.3 to around 1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Her car is in poor condition. Should she spend $1,000 to fix it and drive for a few more years, or buy a Tesla to improve her quality of life? Although she&rsquo;s tempted, she feels she is still in the early stages of wealth accumulation.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: He advises spending the $1,000 to fix the car. Since her total assets are not yet substantial, buying a fifty or sixty-thousand-dollar car would be too high a percentage of her total assets. At this stage, she should continue to invest her funds. The teacher suggests she cleverly use credit cards, such as an Apple Card or American Express with 2%-3% cash back, and invest all the rewards into TQQQ, thereby &ldquo;getting richer as you spend.&rdquo; At the same time, he shared a personal regret. Due to his frugality, when he took his mother to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, she hesitated to take more dishes to be considerate of him, a memory that he later deeply regretted. Therefore, while buying a car is not recommended, one should not be overly frugal on crucial matters like showing filial piety to parents.</li>

<li>She shared a personal insight, viewing the wealth growth in her account as &ldquo;a grace from heaven and the teacher&rsquo;s enlightenment.&rdquo; Because this money was &ldquo;originally nothing,&rdquo; her heart is filled with gratitude.</li>
<li>During the recent floods in Hualien, her family suggested making a donation. She sold a portion of her gains from 00670L (a 2x leveraged ETF) to donate, which she calls &ldquo;charitable rebalancing.&rdquo; She felt very happy donating it because the money was never &ldquo;hers&rdquo; to begin with. She has taken on a leadership role in a local charity and believes the money for charity doesn&rsquo;t come &ldquo;from her pocket&rdquo; but is obtained through investment wisdom, which can then be naturally given back to society.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: After listening to a Buddhist dharma talk, she associated Teacher James&rsquo;s teachings with helping people &ldquo;escape the cycle of poverty,&rdquo; which filled her with a &ldquo;mind of reverence.&rdquo; She shared her recent action: she resolutely terminated a losing insurance policy, got back $24,000, and immediately invested it using the teacher&rsquo;s method. She believes that although it&rsquo;s a short-term loss, it&rsquo;s more important to cut losses in time and get on the right &ldquo;elevator,&rdquo; as she can earn it back in the coming years. She also began to ponder the deeper meaning of the teacher&rsquo;s emphasis on &ldquo;reserving 15 years of cash,&rdquo; understanding it&rsquo;s to ensure that one can both live without worry and navigate through a long bear market via rebalancing.</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: He explained the &ldquo;15 years of cash&rdquo; concept in detail. It is mainly for retired individuals with no source of income. The calculation is: annual expenses minus fixed income (like social security), then multiply the amount you need to cover by 15. For example, if you need to provide $50,000 yourself annually, you need to prepare $750,000 in cash. This standard is based on the historical experience of 2000-2015, where the market might have taken 15 years to return to its high. For those still working, they can dynamically replenish cash with their monthly salary and don&rsquo;t need to strictly sell stocks for rebalancing.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is a &ldquo;veteran student&rdquo; who has been following the teacher since 2011. He believes that new students today are very fortunate because the teacher&rsquo;s current investment strategy (indexing, long-term holding, automation) has evolved to its &ldquo;most perfect moment.&rdquo; He recalled that in the early years, the teacher&rsquo;s methods included individual stock picking and active trading. While it was possible to avoid major crashes, it was difficult for ordinary people to follow, and the after-tax returns were not ideal. Many old students missed out on the later, more optimized strategies because they didn&rsquo;t continue learning. He himself, based on the teacher&rsquo;s latest retirement calculation method in late 2023, found that he had enough to retire. He officially retired in January 2024 and now lives a wonderful life, with his investment income even exceeding his previous salary.</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: He thanked Dr. An for his sharing. He compared his early investment teaching to an &ldquo;expeditionary force,&rdquo; with heavy casualties and few who could keep up. Now, because online teaching doesn&rsquo;t allow for real-time command of tens of thousands of students, the strategy had to evolve into a &ldquo;space force&rdquo;—a fully automated model with no manual intervention. The pandemic accelerated this transformation. He praised Dr. An for not only keeping up but also implementing advanced operations like stock pledging and Roth conversions.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: With this conflicting mindset of &ldquo;wanting to accelerate&rdquo; yet knowing &ldquo;safety comes first,&rdquo; how should he adjust his asset allocation and mentality?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Since he is nearly 10 years away from retirement, he can absolutely adopt a more aggressive strategy. He can maintain a Beta of 1.0 and &ldquo;not rebalance&rdquo; for the next few years, letting his profits run. This might naturally increase his Beta to 1.3 or even 1.5. When he is about 5 years from retirement, he can start &ldquo;hitting the brakes&rdquo; by gradually increasing his cash position and reducing risk.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He feels very lucky to have encountered the teacher when the strategy was already in its &ldquo;final form.&rdquo; He only truly understood some of the teacher&rsquo;s concepts, like the &ldquo;risk of risk,&rdquo; after listening repeatedly. He has implemented a 433 allocation (40% index, 30% leveraged, 30% cash) and has saved 50 times his annual expenses and 15 years of cash.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: At the age of 30-something, how can one better &ldquo;exchange money for spiritual energy&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The core of spiritual energy is &ldquo;vision&rdquo; and &ldquo;capacity of mind.&rdquo; You should practice a mindset: imagine you suddenly have 20 billion. If your lifestyle and mentality remain unchanged, then your spiritual energy is strong enough. True financial freedom is when &ldquo;money&rdquo; disappears from your life. It becomes like air, natural. When you consume, you no longer consider the price, only the value and experience. This is what frees you from trivial matters, allowing your spiritual energy to grow stronger.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: His investment return has reached 220%. He feels very free and more confident at work.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: He wanted to confirm if his understanding is correct: Since his early portfolio was quite aggressive, now that his assets have grown, should he primarily allocate new monthly funds to his cash position to gradually build up the 15-year cash buffer mentioned by the teacher, rather than adjusting his existing stock positions?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This idea is completely correct and is an excellent method of dynamic adjustment. He also shared a conversation with his daughter, explaining why he chooses QQQ over VOO: <strong>&ldquo;You should reduce volatility by increasing cash, not by investing in a lower-return asset.&rdquo;</strong> Low long-term return is the biggest risk.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is a new student who just found the channel two weeks ago and lost sleep for a few days due to the sheer volume of information. His previous belief was to hold VT and 0050 long-term and sell assets to live on in retirement. He only understood the groundbreaking concept of &ldquo;stock pledging&rdquo; after encountering the teacher.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>:
<ol>
<li>If, after retiring and starting to withdraw via pledging for 3 years, his cash reserves reach the 15-year level, does he need to prepare 18 years of cash to be safe, considering the 3 years of living expenses already borrowed?</li>
<li>When the teacher retired at 42, did he already have the concept of living off a pledged-asset line of credit? What was the inspiration for this idea?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>No, it&rsquo;s not necessary. Because after a few years of market growth, your total asset size will be much larger than at the beginning. The growth in assets will be more than enough to cover the borrowed portion, making your safety cushion even thicker.</li>
<li>It was an evolutionary process. He didn&rsquo;t know about it when he retired; he discovered it later. In 2018, he needed money but didn&rsquo;t want to sell stocks and pay high taxes, so he proactively emailed his brokerage to ask if he could borrow against his stocks. The brokerage immediately set up a pledged-asset loan for him. He pointed out that this is a &ldquo;secret&rdquo; of the financial industry because regulations restrict brokerages from proactively marketing such banking services to clients unless the client asks first.</li>

<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The US dollar itself is an &ldquo;aggressive currency,&rdquo; exchanging paper money for the real assets of other countries. Stablecoin increases the efficiency of this &ldquo;aggression&rdquo; by at least 10 times because it can bypass central banks and the SWIFT system, penetrating directly into the general populace. This will cause more countries to lose their monetary sovereignty. The significant increase in the circulation of the US dollar will bring enormous interest income to US financial institutions. The $3 trillion estimate might even be conservative. This is a silent &ldquo;capitalist war.&rdquo;</li>

<li>If you still have income, use the income to maintain the ratio. If you are fully retired, simply withdraw one year&rsquo;s living expenses from the cash portion annually. If the market goes up, let your cash reserves naturally grow to, say, 20 years. When the market falls, use the portion above your 15-16 year baseline to buy stocks.</li>

<li><strong>Son</strong>: Just started working with a stable income. All spare cash should go into 00662. There is no need to hold cash at this stage.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>For retirement, what matters is cash flow, not rate of return. Return is secondary; survival is the most important thing.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This viewpoint was a common thread throughout the session and is the cornerstone of this asset allocation strategy, reminding retirees to place financial security above return growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. &hellip; The true Tao is the one you comprehend for yourself. Everything spoken is just the surface, the written words of a martial arts manual.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher emphasizes the importance of independent thinking and personal practice in investing. Knowledge must be internalized to become true wisdom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A peanut for your parents while they&rsquo;re alive is worth more than a whole pig on the altar after they&rsquo;re gone. (Taiwanese proverb)
&ndash; Teacher James (Quoted by Jenny during her sharing)</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher uses this vivid metaphor to stress that filial piety and care should be expressed while loved ones are still alive; their value far exceeds lavish memorials after they have passed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don&rsquo;t reduce volatility by changing your investment vehicle; you reduce volatility by holding cash. Low long-term return is the real risk.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>A concise point made by the teacher when answering his daughter&rsquo;s question, pointing out that the correct way to handle market volatility is to adjust the cash ratio, not to sacrifice long-term returns by choosing a less volatile asset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to first tell yourself that he is right, and I am wrong. &hellip; Why would someone who is wrong be so loud? This will make you reflect.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher&rsquo;s method for practicing patience, shared when answering how to maintain it. By first acknowledging the other person&rsquo;s validity, one can effectively de-escalate one&rsquo;s own emotions and achieve more peaceful communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never pay back borrowed money. This is very important. If you intend to pay back the money from a pledged-asset line, you shouldn&rsquo;t have borrowed it in the first place.
&ndash; Benson &amp; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Benson&rsquo;s sharing and the teacher&rsquo;s confirmation highlight the core essence of stock pledging: the borrowed money is a tool for living expenses or reinvestment. The goal is to ensure the cash-flow-generating asset is never depleted, thus &ldquo;repaying the principal&rdquo; is an incorrect operation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When investing doesn&rsquo;t exist, the market doesn&rsquo;t exist, and money doesn&rsquo;t exist, that&rsquo;s when your spiritual energy is at its peak.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher describes the highest state of financial freedom. When wealth is so abundant that one no longer needs to think or worry about money itself, one can attain true spiritual freedom.</p>

<p>This session was an extremely profound and practical lesson on retirement financial planning. Teacher James has evolved from his previous focus on &ldquo;the highest return under safe conditions&rdquo; to a more conservative strategy centered on &ldquo;absolute safety,&rdquo; providing a clear and actionable guide to asset allocation and withdrawal rates for those approaching or in retirement. Through the detailed breakdown of the 30%, 40%, and 50% cash allocation models, individuals in different financial situations can find a suitable &ldquo;survival&rdquo; plan. The numerous student sharings in the Q&amp;A session, from the &ldquo;then and now&rdquo; comparisons of veteran students to the &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moments and practical applications of new students, vividly demonstrated how this investment philosophy can change the financial destinies and life outlooks of different people. The entire session was not just a transmission of investment techniques but a deep exchange on views about wealth, risk, and life wisdom.</p>

<p>The core of this session is the mindset and strategy investors should adopt in an ever-innovating market. Teacher James emphasizes that the market&rsquo;s long-term trend is upward, and one should enter as early as possible and hold on. At the same time, he deeply analyzes two common yet high-risk assets: real estate and leveraged funds. He argues that real estate is not a good investment and carries extremely high risk. As for leveraged funds, while their short-term returns are tempting, their violent fluctuations can lead to a total loss of investment. Therefore, it is essential to control risk and lock in profits through &ldquo;smart rebalancing.&rdquo; Ultimately, only index funds are quality assets that can be passed down through generations.</p>

<li>Teacher James once again recommended &ldquo;The Bible of Wealth Management,&rdquo; published in 1996, believing its philosophy is still highly relevant today and is a national treasure of a book.</li>
<li><strong>Core Philosophy</strong>: &ldquo;Buy anytime, buy casually, don&rsquo;t sell.&rdquo; This strategy, similar to buying and holding the entire market, aligns perfectly with the philosophy of index funds.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Compounding</strong>: The book gives an example: investing just 1200 yuan a month at a 20% rate of return can grow to 100 million in 40 years. This demonstrates the astonishing power of long-term investment; the key to wealth is investing, not saving or having a high income.</li>
<li><strong>The Root of Wealth Inequality</strong>: The book also mentions that wealth inequality stems from a lack of financial education, which aligns closely with the mission of this channel. If you don&rsquo;t have enough funds to retire at 65, the problem lies in your personal investment failures, not society.</li>

<ul>
<li>The teacher clearly states that from a return on investment perspective, a house is not a good investment and is extremely risky.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Risk</strong>: A 30-to-40-year mortgage is like a chain. If you face a crisis like mid-life unemployment, you risk foreclosure. Without a mortgage, this worry doesn&rsquo;t exist.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Risk</strong>: Natural disasters like earthquakes and fires are frequent. Even with insurance, the process of rebuilding and relocating is filled with pain and inconvenience, like carrying a &ldquo;powder keg.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Judgment Standard</strong>: The teacher offers a vivid analogy: <strong>&ldquo;You should only buy your first house when you have the ability to buy two.&rdquo;</strong> Buying a house should be like buying slippers—if they break, you can easily get a new pair. Only then is it not a risk.</li>
<li><strong>The Correct Path</strong>: First, work hard on investing to become wealthy. When your wealth reaches a certain level (e.g., 100 million, 500 million), then use borrowed funds (e.g., borrow 20 million, 100 million) to easily buy a house, achieving a &ldquo;no-money-down&rdquo; acquisition.</li>
<li><strong>Index Funds are the True &ldquo;Real Estate&rdquo;</strong>: Compared to physical property that depreciates and has holding costs (like management fees, property taxes), only index funds are quality assets that can last for a century, be passed down through generations, and become more stable over time.</li>

<ul>
<li>The teacher referenced a chart from the &ldquo;JSON Model Lab&rdquo; channel to show the extreme risk of TQQQ (3x leveraged QQQ).</li>
<li><strong>Historical Simulation</strong>: The simulation shows that one dollar invested in TQQQ in 1985 would have grown to $3,510 at the peak of the 2000 dot-com bubble, but then crashed to $1.13 in the subsequent bear market, a staggering drop of 99.96%, nearly wiping it out.</li>
<li><strong>The Trap of Long-Term Returns</strong>: Over the long period from 1985 to the present, due to decay from market volatility, TQQQ (18.28% annualized) performed worse than the 2x leveraged QLD (19.39% annualized).</li>
<li><strong>The Long Recovery Period</strong>: After the 2000 crash, QQQ reached a new high around 2014, and QLD broke even around 2022. However, if you held only TQQQ, it could take over 22 years to recover your losses, which would be devastating to any retirement plan.</li>
<li><strong>The Only Solution for Risk Control: Smart Rebalancing</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: To prevent TQQQ from dropping over 99% from its peak, which would wipe out a lifetime of investment.</li>
<li><strong>Method</strong>: At the end of the year or the beginning of the next, transfer one-third of this year&rsquo;s profits from the leveraged fund to a cash position to lock in profits and reduce risk.</li>
<li><strong>Warning</strong>: The decline of a leveraged fund is instantaneous; it might go to zero before you have a chance to rebalance. Therefore, the amount invested must be money you can afford to lose completely. The teacher does not recommend leveraged funds for beginners or those unfamiliar with their characteristics. A 70/30 (QQQ/cash) allocation is relatively stable.</li>

<li><strong>Pledged Asset Line (PAL) Fund Flow Warning</strong>: For investors at Charles Schwab in the US, the teacher warned that their software is now very intelligent and can track the flow of funds borrowed through a PAL. Even after multiple transfers, if the funds eventually end up in a brokerage account and are used to buy stocks, the system will detect it. You might receive a warning the first time, and subsequently, your PAL privileges could be revoked. Be careful to avoid such operations.</li>
<li><strong>View on Financial Professionals</strong>: The teacher pointedly noted that the experts and financial professionals who talk loudly in the market mostly fall into two categories:
<ol>
<li><strong>Ignorant</strong>: &ldquo;Demons and monsters&rdquo; who don&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: How to distinguish between necessary expenses and deferrable pleasures? For example, how to decide whether to buy a car or travel abroad? Is there a metric to avoid impacting future wealth through overspending?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a great question that can be solved with planning.
<ol>
<li><strong>Set a Goal</strong>: First, clarify your retirement goal, for instance, how much money you want in 20 years (e.g., 60 million).</li>
<li><strong>Calculate Required Investment</strong>: Use an investment calculator. Based on your current assets and expected rate of return (e.g., 14%), calculate how much you need to invest each month to reach your goal.</li>
<li><strong>Spend Freely</strong>: After deducting the required monthly investment from the money you can save, the remainder can be freely spent, used for travel, or put into a travel fund.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Adjustment</strong>: This calculation is dynamic. For example, if you have 10 million now and your goal is 60 million in 20 years, the calculator might show that you can even spend 66,000 per month and still reach your goal.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Don&rsquo;t save all your money; learn to spend it. You should start planning your consumption from a young age. As long as your retirement plan is not affected, you should enjoy life. Otherwise, earning a lot of money becomes meaningless. The teacher added that if you are going to spend, the memories from travel are eternal—a form of spiritual consumption more valuable than material goods that depreciate.</li>

<li>Sharing: After listening to the teacher&rsquo;s classes for three months, she cleared out over a dozen miscellaneous stocks in her Canadian Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) and switched everything to TQQQ and QLD. She convinced her husband they could retire because their assets were sufficient. She is now allocating cash and QQQ in her taxable account (IBKR).</li>
<li>Question: In the future, with new TFSA contribution room each year (e.g., C$7,000 per person) and new funds coming in monthly, how should she invest? Should she buy according to the target allocation (e.g., 40% QQQ, 35% cash, 15% TQQQ), prioritize building up the cash position, or decide based on the beta value at the time?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Account Separation</strong>: Leveraged funds (TQQQ/QLD) should be in the tax-free account (TFSA); QQQ and cash should be in the taxable account (IBKR).</li>
<li><strong>Tax-Free Account</strong>: When new contribution room is available, just buy more leveraged funds. Only rebalance if the leveraged funds become an excessively large portion of your total assets.</li>
<li><strong>Taxable Account</strong>: For new monthly funds, you can simplify the process. For example, in a year with 12 months, you could designate that the savings from 4 of those months go directly to cash, and the savings from the other 8 months are used to buy QQQ. This ensures the cash position grows, and you can review and do a major rebalancing at the end of the year.</li>

<li>Sharing: Responding to the previous student&rsquo;s question about consumption, he used to be someone who saved fanatically and was afraid to spend. After listening to the teacher, he understood that if you want to buy a car, for example, you can do so as long as you ensure you still have an equivalent amount of money to continue investing in QQQ. Between memories and material things, one should invest more in creating memories (like travel).</li>
<li>Question: He received an email and a call from QQQ about a special meeting to vote on changing the fund structure from a &ldquo;Unit Investment Trust (UIT)&rdquo; to an &ldquo;Open-End Fund.&rdquo; He wanted to ask for the teacher&rsquo;s opinion on this.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a normal and positive change. The vast majority of ETFs today (like QQQM) are already open-end funds. This change allows the fund to have its own board of directors for management, freeing it from bank trusteeship, which can lower fees and increase management flexibility. My personal recommendation is to vote &ldquo;approve.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Sharing: A client of his, a cardiologist from a wealthy family, was outbid for a luxury mansion by a woman. This woman offered a higher price and had 150 million USD in cash in her bank account, wealth that came entirely from early investments in stocks like Nvidia. This story illustrates that the wealth created by successful equity investing can easily surpass the accumulation of several generations of elite professionals.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: This is very normal. For someone who understands investing, 100 million USD is the minimum threshold. Your professional income doesn&rsquo;t determine your ultimate wealth; only long-term, stable financial investment is the key to riches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: Why was the market reaction negative when the US government initially proposed to exchange subsidies for equity in companies like TSMC, but the stock price rose after the company refused? Aren&rsquo;t government subsidies the people&rsquo;s money? What&rsquo;s wrong with letting the government (the people) share in the profits?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You have to look at this from the perspective of shareholder interests.
<ol>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s Bad for Companies Not Lacking Cash</strong>: For a company with ample cash flow like TSMC, it doesn&rsquo;t need the money. Accepting government funds and issuing new shares to the government would dilute the equity of existing shareholders, which is detrimental to them. If the government wants to own TSMC stock, it should buy it on the open market, not ask the company to print shares for it.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s Good for Companies on the Brink of Bankruptcy</strong>: However, for companies in financial crisis like Ford and General Motors (GM) at the time, they desperately needed funds to survive, so they were willing to accept the government&rsquo;s terms for taking an equity stake. This was a bailout, not a normal business investment.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A healthy company has no reason to sacrifice shareholder interests to take government money.</li>

<li>Question 1: The teacher says pledged loans should not exceed 20% of total assets. Is there a percentage limit for non-pledged debt like personal loans and mortgages? His current debt of this type is about 40% of his total assets. Is this too high?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t worry at all. Personal loans and mortgages are completely different from pledged loans. They don&rsquo;t have market volatility risk and won&rsquo;t trigger a Margin Call if stock prices fall. As long as your salary plus the 2% withdrawal from your pledged line of credit can comfortably cover the interest and principal payments, this debt is safe. A 40% ratio is very healthy, far safer than someone with zero assets but a 9 million mortgage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Since the 1-2% withdrawal from the pledged line of credit is enough to cover all the interest on his personal loans and mortgage, does this mean he can spend his entire salary and enjoy life?

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I recommend taking out the personal loan first. A personal loan is a loan without market volatility risk, making it relatively safer. You can take out the personal loan to invest in the market and then use the cash flow from your stock pledge (e.g., 2% annually) to pay off the interest and principal of the personal loan. Don&rsquo;t start by borrowing a large sum (like 20%) from your investment portfolio to reinvest; that would increase the risk associated with market fluctuations. Safety first.</li>

<li>Question 1: All her leveraged funds are in a Roth IRA account, and she plans to leave them untouched for another 15 years. Is a Beta value of 1.3 acceptable?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Absolutely not! 15 years is too short a time for a high-leverage allocation. If you encounter a major bear market (like in 2000), your assets might not recover before you retire. Historical data shows it took QLD (2x) 22 years to break even. A Beta of 1.3 is far too risky; you might not be able to retire smoothly. You must lower it immediately, do not exceed 1.0.</li>

<li><strong>Financial Priority</strong>: The huge financial difference is the primary consideration.</li>
<li><strong>Value of Time</strong>: The saved commuting time is for rest, relaxation, and enjoying life, not for taking on more work.</li>

At that point, you can choose to rent or buy, giving you complete freedom. Don&rsquo;t sacrifice a huge present benefit for an uncertain future. Procrastinating is losing money.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: After any major bill is passed, it takes a few months for the executive branch to prepare the related regulations, website systems, registration processes, etc. This is a normal administrative preparation period, not an intentional delay.</li>

<li>Question 2: Elon Musk criticizes the government for inefficient spending, but according to Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), the more the government spends, the better it is for the economy. How does the teacher view this contradiction?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: From an investor&rsquo;s perspective, as long as the government is willing to spend money, whether it&rsquo;s spent wisely or not, it&rsquo;s a good thing. This is because money flowing stimulates the economy, which will ultimately be reflected in stock prices. The passage of the stablecoin bill will greatly increase market liquidity. When the Treasury issues a $1 bond and a bank buys it, the bank can then issue a $1 stablecoin using the bond as collateral. This effectively doubles the liquidity in the market, making capital extremely abundant. This is a huge positive for the stock market; stock prices will soar.</li>

<li><strong>00670L Loss Issue</strong>: A student mentioned losing money on a leveraged ETF purchased this year. The teacher pointed out that the ETF is up year-to-date and the student should focus on annual returns, not short-term fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Rebalancing Operation</strong>: The specific operation is to transfer one-third of <strong>this year&rsquo;s profits</strong> from the leveraged fund to cash. For example, if TQQQ made $100,000 this year, you transfer $30,000 to cash.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla Purchase Advice</strong>: It is recommended to finance the purchase directly rather than leasing, as the car itself is very durable, and in the US, ordering before the end of September comes with a $7,500 discount.</li>
<li><strong>Nature of Money</strong>: The teacher explained that modern currency is essentially debt-based; a banknote is a short-term bond that can be paid immediately.</li>

<p>Context: After showing the astonishing historical decline of TQQQ, the teacher repeatedly emphasized the risk of leveraged funds going to zero and pointed out the absolute necessity of smart rebalancing.</p>

<p>This session covered a rich and profound range of topics, from macroeconomic market trends and investment philosophy to specific asset risk analysis and practical personal financial planning. Teacher James once again reinforced the core strategy of long-term holding of index funds and provided an in-depth analysis and risk warning for two highly tempting yet perilous assets: real estate and leveraged funds. Through the specific method of &ldquo;smart rebalancing,&rdquo; he offered a clear risk control path for investors wishing to use leverage. The Q&amp;A session tightly integrated theory with real-life situations, providing clear guidance on everything from consumption and debt management to understanding new financial legislation. Overall, this was an invaluable lesson that reminds us to stay clear-headed in a bull market—to be brave in embracing growth while always respecting risk.</p>
