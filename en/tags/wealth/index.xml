</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Money is Personified:</strong> Kim personifies money, suggesting it possesses emotions and will. Your attitude towards money influences how it behaves towards you. Respect and treat it like a friend to earn its favor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investing in Superior Entrepreneurs:</strong>  Investing in companies and entrepreneurs more competent than oneself is a wise move, akin to partnering with them and reaping the rewards of their success. The author shares how he invested in successful companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Nike, effectively becoming their &ldquo;partner.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Secret of Compound Interest:</strong>  Compound interest is a fundamental principle in investment, capable of multiplying wealth. However, one must also be wary of its power when applied to debt. The author uses Warren Buffett&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mona Lisa&rdquo; analogy to illustrate the impact of compound interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Strength of Fixed Income:</strong> Stable cash flow surpasses inconsistent income, attracting and accumulating wealth. Kim compares fixed income to a well-trained army, capable of efficiently managing a large-scale organization despite smaller numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Money&rsquo;s Gravitational Force:</strong> Substantial wealth attracts more wealth. Starting with small accumulations, compound interest propels wealth multiplication, much like the Earth formed from the gradual attraction of minuscule particles. The author illustrates this concept with the Han River and the Amazon River, demonstrating how small streams can converge to form vast rivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highest Risk, Lowest Risk:</strong> The stock market is riskiest when everyone is bullish and chasing the latest hot stock; conversely, it&rsquo;s least risky when fear grips the market and everyone is selling.  Maintain a balanced perspective on fear and greed, embracing opportunity during widespread fear and exercising caution when greed prevails. Warren Buffet&rsquo;s famous quote, &ldquo;Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,&rdquo; encapsulates this wisdom.  The author uses the example of increased airline safety a week after an accident to illustrate this point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Treat Others&rsquo; Money as You Treat Your Own:</strong> Treating others&rsquo; money with respect safeguards your own from similar disrespect.  Respect for others&rsquo; money is reciprocated. The author uses his attitude towards shopping carts at supermarkets to emphasize the importance of respecting others&rsquo; money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inheriting Millions with a &ldquo;No Loss&rdquo; Clause:</strong>  Through a hypothetical scenario, Kim highlights that preserving wealth is not straightforward. It requires learning, accumulating experience, and recognizing the significance of consistent income. The protagonist in the story inherits a substantial sum with the stipulation of no loss, ultimately realizing that maintaining wealth&rsquo;s value is no easy feat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rejecting Quick Riches:</strong>  The pursuit of quick wealth often leads to speculative traps and the perils of greed, ultimately ending in failure.  Building wealth demands a steady and gradual approach.  The author uses the analogy of constructing a house to demonstrate the importance of gradual wealth accumulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can Economists Predict the Future?:</strong>  No one can accurately predict the macroeconomic future, especially in the long term, due to inherent uncertainties. Resist blindly following expert predictions; cultivate independent thinking and continuous learning.  Kim quotes economist John Kenneth Galbraith: &ldquo;There are two kinds of people in the world: those who don&rsquo;t know and those who don&rsquo;t know they don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Buying Samsung Stock at Samsung Securities:</strong> This anecdote illustrates the need for knowledge before venturing into investments. Avoid assumptions; understand market rules and investment tools. Kim compares the stock market to a ruthless jungle, where knowledge is essential for survival.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Changing Your Destiny Through Respectful Address:</strong> A personal experience highlights the importance of respecting others and showing genuine interest in their affairs, leading to trust, goodwill, and ultimately, good fortune.  The entrepreneur in the story habitually addresses everyone as &ldquo;that person,&rdquo; ultimately losing friends and connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Repeated Luck is Skill, Repeated Failure is Habit:</strong> Lucky individuals often possess greater astuteness and intelligence. They excel at observation, learning, and accumulating experience.  Conversely, repeated failure calls for introspection and addressing personal shortcomings.  The author uses examples like lottery tickets, rock-paper-scissors, and parking spots to illustrate the interplay of luck and skill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discerning Fact from Investment Hype in News:</strong> Using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example, Kim underlines the importance of focusing on facts and data, rather than blindly trusting media reports and expert predictions. He reached a more accurate assessment by comparing the total number of infections with the infection rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Each Dollar Experiences Time Differently:</strong> Borrowing Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity, the author suggests that money is also subject to the influence of time. Different sources of money experience time differently; always invest with money that has ample time.  Kim compares &ldquo;time-rich&rdquo; money to individuals who have more time to build relationships, fall in love, and raise children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diversification Isn&rsquo;t Enough:</strong> Kim critiques the misinterpretation of the saying &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put all your eggs in one basket.&rdquo; Diversifying within a single market is merely using multiple baskets on the same shelf, still exposed to risk. He recommends spreading investments across diverse markets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Three Paths to Wealth:</strong>  The author outlines three ways to become wealthy: inheritance, winning the lottery, and business success. He encourages young people to pursue entrepreneurship or engage in long-term investment. Kim elaborates on two paths to business success: starting a business or investing in successful companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why Savings Don&rsquo;t Grow:</strong>  The root causes of stagnant savings lie in spending future income, neglecting asset management, undervaluing small amounts of money, and lacking investment knowledge. The author advises readers to ditch credit cards, use debit cards, and appreciate the power of accumulating small amounts of money.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>

<li>Bill Gates getting into a high school with a computer was luck. His friend Kent Evans dying in a mountain climbing accident was risk.</li>
<li>Recognizing the influence of luck and risk helps avoid over-attributing success or failure solely to personal effort or poor decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Never Enough</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contentment is key in finance. The pursuit of &ldquo;never enough&rdquo; leads to a dangerous cycle of insatiable desire that can ultimately lead to ruin.</li>
<li>Former McKinsey CEO Rajat Gupta and Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff are cited as examples of individuals who lost everything due to greed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Confounding Compounding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compounding’s power lies in long-term accumulation, allowing even small gains to snowball into extraordinary results.</li>
<li>Warren Buffett&rsquo;s immense wealth is attributed not just to skilled investment but to 70 years of consistent investing, highlighting the power of time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Getting wealthy requires taking risks, while staying wealthy requires humility, frugality, and respecting the fleeting nature of good fortune.</li>
<li>Trading legend Jesse Livermore, despite remarkable success, fell victim to overconfidence and excessive risk-taking, ultimately leading to bankruptcy and suicide.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Tails, You Win</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In business and investing, &ldquo;tail events&rdquo; (rare, high-impact events) often disproportionately drive overall results.</li>
<li>Walt Disney produced hundreds of films, but the success of a single one, Snow White, propelled his entire enterprise to unimaginable heights.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Freedom</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The greatest dividend of wealth is the ability to control your time, offering the ultimate flexibility to pursue your passions and spend time with loved ones.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. The Ferrari Fallacy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People care less about your wealth than you think. Their attention is often directed towards their own desires and comparing themselves to you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9. Wealth is What You Don&rsquo;t See</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>True wealth lies not in flashy possessions but in the unseen: financial security, flexibility, and the ability to make choices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10. Save Money</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Building wealth hinges on your savings rate, which is driven by lifestyle choices and managing desires.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>11. Reasonable &gt; Rational</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In financial decisions, making reasonable choices that you can stick with is often more effective than striving for absolute rationality.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>12. Surprise!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>History is full of surprises, so relying solely on historical patterns to predict the future is unreliable. Recognizing the constant possibility of the unexpected is crucial.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>13. Room for Error</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan: Building in a margin of safety is crucial.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>14. You&rsquo;ll Change</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our goals, thoughts, and aspirations change over time. Acknowledging this is essential when making long-term financial plans. Avoid extreme financial goals, embracing the fluid nature of life.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>15. Nothing&rsquo;s Free</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Everything has a price. Success in investing comes with costs: volatility, fear, and uncertainty. Viewing these as fees for a valuable service rather than penalties to avoid helps navigate the emotional rollercoaster of investing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>16. No One&rsquo;s Crazy (Reprise)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid blindly following financial advice from people with different circumstances and timelines than your own.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>17. The Seduction of Pessimism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pessimism often seems more intelligent and gains more attention, even though the world has generally improved significantly over time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>18. When You Believe Anything</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The power of narratives shapes our beliefs. The more we want something to be true, the more likely we are to embrace narratives that inflate its likelihood, especially in high-risk, high-reward scenarios like investing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>19. Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This chapter provides a recap of the key principles and advice from previous chapters to guide sound financial decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>20. Confessions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The author shares his own personal approach to money management, highlighting the importance of seeking financial independence and emphasizing long-term investing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Appendix: A Brief History of the American Consumer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Post-WWII, the US deliberately engineered the American consumer through low-interest rates, consumer credit, and programs like the GI Bill, fostering a culture of consumption and economic growth.</li>
<li>From the 1950s to the 1970s, income distribution remained relatively equitable, the debt was manageable, and confidence in a better future was high.</li>
<li>The 1980s onwards witnessed growing income inequality. The aspirational lifestyles of a small group of prosperous individuals diverged drastically from those of the average person, fostering a culture of keeping up appearances, fueled by debt.</li>
<li>The 2008 financial crisis, a culmination of a debt bubble, exposed the cracks in this system.</li>
<li>Recent years have seen a rise in social unrest tied to income inequality, prompting individuals to question the current economic and social model.</li>

<p>The theme of this episode is &ldquo;Investing and Financial Management, Wealth is a Gift.&rdquo; The core viewpoints  are: <strong>Wealth is innate, but one must be informed to realize it; investing and financial management is an important way to accumulate wealth; index investing is an effective method to achieve long-term stable growth; rational asset allocation and risk control are the keys to investment success; and overcoming psychological barriers in investment and solidifying the long-term investment philosophy are crucial to ultimately achieving financial freedom.</strong></p>

    </span>        
    
</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth is a Gift:</strong> Wealth is innate, and being informed of this fact makes a huge difference. While successful entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are a minority, most people need to be told that &ldquo;wealth is a gift,&rdquo; and they need to learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Index Investing and Compound Interest:</strong> Index investing is an effective way to achieve long-term stable returns, and its compounding effect is astonishing. For example, investing $1,500 per month for 40 years with a 14% annualized return will yield $2.6 million. <strong>Even small amounts of money can accumulate considerable wealth through consistent long-term investment.</strong></li>
<li><strong>High Risk, High Return?</strong>: High risk doesn&rsquo;t necessarily lead to high returns. Whether you can bear the risk determines whether you can ultimately achieve high returns. Don&rsquo;t overestimate your risk tolerance. Your risk appetite should be determined by an asset allocation that you can withstand even if your investment goes to zero. <strong>For example, if you cannot afford the risk of TQQQ going to zero, you should not invest in TQQQ.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Choosing Investment Targets</strong>: It is recommended to invest in the global Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ). Those with insufficient funds or who are already retired can consider investing in SPY or high-dividend ETFs. Avoid investing in individual stocks because they tend to disappear over the long term, while index funds can continue to exist. <strong>The half-life of individual stocks is 10 years; out of 100 stocks, there may be less than three left after 50 years.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Investment Mindset</strong>: The market will eventually rise, and investment requires patience. Always stay optimistic, even if the investment goes to zero. Learning about investing and financial management requires continuous thinking, like peeling an onion, layer by layer, to elevate the energy of the spiritual level. <strong>Investing is like the Yellow Mountain, eternally unchanging, yet different every day; every learning experience will bring new insights.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation</strong>: Asset allocation is like building a house; it is a big project that requires comprehensive planning, not something simple. It is necessary to consider many factors, such as whether you are retired, your age, income, debt, and cash flow, to formulate a reasonable asset allocation plan. <strong>You need to carefully study the articles and videos on asset allocation provided by James to develop a plan that suits you.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do Not  Blindly Trust External Information</strong>: Financial professionals often only consider their interests, so do not easily believe their advice. Think independently, study carefully, and do not be swayed by external information and noise. <strong>Most of the outside information is garbage; do not be affected by it, focus on learning James&rsquo; investment philosophy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Balancing Risk and Reward</strong>: Do not excessively pursue high returns or completely risk-free investments; balance risk and reward. Avoid changing investment strategies easily to prevent additional costs due to frequent trading. <strong>James&rsquo; investment methods can guarantee asset appreciation and relative safety, avoiding extreme situations.</strong></li>

<p><strong>IM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing: Learning about investment is like peeling an onion; at first, the amount of information is overwhelming, but as you learn more, you will gradually understand the core idea and ultimately reach the realm of &ldquo;the great Dao is simple.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: What do you think about the idea that &ldquo;investing is simple&rdquo;?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Such views often mistake ignorance for inaction and do not truly understand the complexity and risks of investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: How should we communicate with friends who don&rsquo;t understand index investing?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can start by briefly introducing the concept and advantages of index investing and suggest that they watch related videos to learn. Don&rsquo;t force them to accept it, everyone has their own choices. <strong>Just like preaching, we can only try our best to spread the message; whether it&rsquo;s ultimately accepted depends on the individual.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LAN:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: How to calculate Beta? What is the actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can refer to the link to the article on Beta calculation on the message board. The actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF may deviate from the theoretical value due to factors such as market volatility and friction costs. <strong>When market volatility is large, the wear and tear of leveraged ETFs will be more serious, resulting in an actual Beta value lower than the theoretical value.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Why is there a huge difference in final return between scenario 3 and scenario 4.1 in the 005 topic?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Scenario 4.1 is where no money is withdrawn from the investment, so the final return will be higher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: How to adjust Beta in a rising market?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response:  The adjustment of Beta should be determined by your own risk tolerance, not by the market trend. <strong>Do not try to predict the market, just keep a fixed Beta value.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 4:  For investments in Taiwan, should I choose Q2D or 00670L?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: 00670L is recommended because it includes New Taiwan dollar hedging, which can reduce the risk caused by exchange rate fluctuations. <strong>Don&rsquo;t change investment targets frequently, choose one that suits you and hold it for the long term.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nai Xin:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Wealth is a gift, just as self-confidence is a gift; everyone has potential, but it needs to be stimulated. The key to investing and financial management lies in learning. Once you have mastered the correct investment method, you can focus on your own career and life and let wealth grow naturally over time. <strong>Overcome fear, build confidence, and you can realize your potential, gain wealth, and achieve success.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Understanding &ldquo;buy whenever you have money,&rdquo; but still finding it difficult to overcome psychological fluctuations when the market rises or falls sharply.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response:  Overcoming psychological fluctuations takes time and experience. You can try to make a small number of trades, experience the impact of market fluctuations, and gradually adapt to market changes.</li>
<li>IM Supplement: You can overcome psychological barriers by imagining starting to invest two years later and understanding that &ldquo;money arrives at different points in time.&rdquo;<strong>Don&rsquo;t worry about buying at the lowest point; as long as you stick to long-term investment, you can get good returns.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hai Rui Ji:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thank you James for selflessly sharing your investment philosophy; students learn from each other and make progress together.</li>
<li>James&rsquo; investment philosophy requires continuous learning and understanding to grasp it fully. &ldquo;Never sell&rdquo; does not mean you cannot sell, but that you should develop a reasonable investment strategy based on your own situation. ** &ldquo;Never sell&rdquo; refers to mentally ignoring market fluctuations and adhering to a long-term investment philosophy.**</li>
<li>Investment philosophy needs to keep pace with the times and adjust investment strategies according to changes in the environment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question: Already answered in the video.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Li Zi:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: To overcome psychological barriers to investment, manage accounts separately, using one part for long-term investment and the other for tentative operations, such as selling covered calls. This satisfies the desire to trade and avoids losses due to frequent trading.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You only know what is best after you have experienced it. Experience in trading can lead to a firmer commitment to a long-term investment strategy. <strong>Trying different trading strategies can help you understand the advantages of long-term investment and ultimately achieve the state of &ldquo;daily reduction for the Dao.&rdquo;</strong></li>

<p>Question 1: Why has the capital market in mainland China performed poorly for a long time?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Emerging markets take time to mature. The Chinese market is like the Taiwanese market 50 years ago. It has the potential to rise in the long term, but its return may be lower than that of the US market. <strong>Investment should focus on sustainable development markets. The US market has advantages in terms of systems and industries.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Under foreign exchange control, how do I invest in US index funds? Are there any risks?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can invest by purchasing ETFs listed in China that track US index funds, such as 513100. Foreign exchange controls mainly restrict the physical flow of funds, and buying ETFs is not restricted. The current scale of such investment is small and will not trigger a quota limit. <strong>Even with foreign exchange control, it is still possible to allocate global assets through legal channels.</strong></li>

<p>Everyone has the potential for wealth, but they must be informed to realize it and learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning Increases Daily, the Dao Decreases Daily
&ndash; IM</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learning about investing and financial management is a process of continuous improvement. At first, you will be exposed to a large amount of information, but as your understanding deepens, you will gradually simplify your investment strategy and eventually reach the state of &ldquo;the great Dao is simple.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Difficult to Return to After Seeing a Vast Ocean
&ndash; Li Zi &amp; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only after experiencing something can you know what is best. In investing, only after actually operating and experiencing market fluctuations and the impact of different investment strategies can you more firmly choose the long-term investment strategy that suits you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The More Money You Borrow, the More Money You Have
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understand and control risk, not avoid it. Understanding how to use leverage can accelerate wealth growth, but only with proper risk management, such as building a solid asset allocation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cash is Air
&ndash; James</p>

<p>Cash is very important and you must keep enough cash to deal with market fluctuations and emergencies.</p>
