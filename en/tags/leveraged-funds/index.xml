<p>The core theme of this session is to emphasize that long-term investors should ignore short-term market volatility and firmly believe in the market&rsquo;s perpetual upward trend. Teacher James points out that having funds out of the market is the biggest risk, and investors should enter the market as soon as possible, adopting a &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, and never sell&rdquo; strategy. By debunking common market prediction indicators (like the Buffett Indicator) and analyzing asset allocation, he aims to help investors build a solid investment mindset to achieve long-term wealth growth.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market Volatility Doesn&rsquo;t Concern Me</strong>: For long-term investors, daily market fluctuations, global situations, tariff wars, etc., should not influence investment decisions. The market hitting new highs for three consecutive days proves the importance of staying in the market.</li>
<li><strong>Being Out of the Market is the Biggest Risk</strong>: Many people exit the market fearing a downturn, but waiting for a correction might mean never getting back in. Keeping funds out of the market and missing out on gains is a far greater risk than a short-term decline.</li>
<li><strong>Predictions are Useless, Making Money is What Matters</strong>: There are many who make correct market predictions, but the ones who actually make money are those who ignore the predictions and stay invested.</li>
<li><strong>The Market Always Goes Up</strong>: This is the core belief a long-term investor must have. Historical data proves that in the long run, the market only goes up and will always reach new highs. Investors should always be extremely optimistic and face the sun.</li>
<li><strong>Review the Past, Preview the Future</strong>: The teacher advises students, especially new ones, to watch videos from the market crashes at the end of 2018, March 2020, and in 2022 to learn how to react correctly during times of panic and to mentally prepare for future market volatility.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Risk in Long-Term Investing</strong>: Looking at a century of history, buying at any point and holding for the long term has always been profitable. However, short-term volatility can be immense, with potential drops of 50% or even 80%, so one must focus on long-term returns.</li>
<li><strong>The Nature of Your Funds Dictates Your Investment</strong>: Money needed for the short term (like tuition or a down payment for a house) must absolutely not be invested in the stock market; it should be kept as cash. Only long-term funds that you won&rsquo;t touch for 10-20 years are suitable for investment.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Asset Allocation</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Seek Stability Before Returns</strong>: Investment allocation should prioritize psychological stability. It is inadvisable for people to switch from an aggressive allocation (e.g., 442) to a conservative one (e.g., 433) when they can&rsquo;t handle the pressure during a market drop (like in April of this year).</li>
<li><strong>A Conservative Beta Value</strong>: It is recommended that an investor&rsquo;s Beta value not exceed 1.0. If you think you can handle 1.0, it&rsquo;s better to subtract 0.2 and adopt a Beta of 0.8, which might be more suitable.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Sufficient Cash</strong>: It&rsquo;s advisable to keep at least 30% in cash. For example, a portfolio of 70% QQQ + 30% Cash.</li>
<li><strong>Gradual Increase in Leverage</strong>: Newcomers to the market can start without using leveraged funds. During a market dip, you can use a small amount of cash (e.g., 2% of assets) to buy a 2x leveraged fund, thereby gradually building a leveraged position and allowing the Beta value to increase naturally as the market rises. This is like riding a smooth, high-class train rather than a bumpy race car.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Case: Currency Exchange Impact on 00662 vs. QLD</strong>
<ul>
<li>A student asked if the performance of 00662 (Fubon NASDAQ-100) lagged behind QLD due to the appreciation of the Taiwan Dollar (TWD).</li>
<li><strong>Teacher&rsquo;s Analysis</strong>: Comparisons must be made in the same currency. Assuming the exchange rate was 33 when investing in QQQ and is now 29, the exchange loss is 12%. Over the past 5 years, QLD&rsquo;s performance was about 128%, and 00662&rsquo;s was about 114%. However, after deducting the 12% currency exchange loss from QLD&rsquo;s 128%, its performance becomes about 112%, which is actually lower than 00662&rsquo;s 114%. The conclusion is that their performances are essentially the same; don&rsquo;t be misled by nominal figures in different currencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Debunking the &ldquo;Buffett Indicator&rdquo; Myth</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Many people use the &ldquo;Total Stock Market Capitalization / GDP&rdquo; ratio to judge if the market is overheated, which is wrong.</li>
<li><strong>GDP is a flow concept</strong>: It only measures the new value added in the current year.</li>
<li><strong>Market Cap is a stock concept</strong>: It includes the value of all of a company&rsquo;s historical investments and accumulated value.</li>
<li>Comparing a changing flow metric to a cumulative stock metric is like comparing apples and oranges; it&rsquo;s completely illogical.</li>
<li>Warren Buffett himself rarely mentions this indicator and emphasizes not to use a single indicator to judge the market. Many &ldquo;pundits&rdquo; and bloggers on the market abuse this concept just to get attention, like mindless &ldquo;parrots.&rdquo;</li>

<li><strong>Beware of Investment Scams</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Teacher James <strong>solemnly declares</strong> that he provides <strong>completely free</strong> and <strong>voluntary teaching</strong>. He will never contact students privately, let alone offer financial services for a 1% fee or any other charge.</li>
<li>Anyone who uses his name on platforms like LINE or WeChat to contact you, claiming they can manage your finances for a fee, is a <strong>scammer</strong>.</li>
<li>In the US, it is illegal for an uncertified financial advisor to charge fees. The teacher stresses that no one cares more about your assets than you do; you must manage your investments yourself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Awakening to Capitalism</strong>: Teacher James puts forward a sharp point: laborers who go to work in modern society are, in essence, &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; of capitalism. The purpose of his teaching is to awaken everyone&rsquo;s &ldquo;capitalist consciousness,&rdquo; to learn to use capitalism to become capitalists, rather than being enslaved by it. (Refer to video <code>00315</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Ultimate Goals in Life</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Health and Longevity are Fundamental</strong>: Longevity is the path to wealth, and health is the mother of happiness. He reminds everyone to get health check-ups (like CT scans).</li>
<li><strong>Happiness is the purpose of life</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth is just the icing on the cake</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>The Principle of Borrowing to Invest</strong>:
<ul>
<li>For money borrowed according to proper principles, <strong>never think about paying it back</strong>.</li>
<li>Once you repay the loan, your risk (Beta value) will immediately increase. For example, an investor with 50% cash and 50% QQQ (Beta=0.5) who uses cash to repay a loan will see their Beta value skyrocket, greatly increasing their risk.</li>
<li>Having cash on hand gives you the confidence to face risks.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is a 65-year-old veteran investor who lost tens of millions in the stock market twice. After starting to learn Teacher James&rsquo;s philosophy after the Chinese New Year, although he had doubts about some points (about 10-15%), he found through deeper study that the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy is continuously refined and has deep logic.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: The market often says, &ldquo;If you miss the best few days of gains, your annualized return will drop significantly.&rdquo; What is the specific definition of this &ldquo;best time for gains&rdquo;?</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Regarding &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; versus &ldquo;mindless rebalancing,&rdquo; if the market is still rising at the end of the year, will rebalancing then cause one to miss out on subsequent gains?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>On Missing Up Days</strong>: This is precisely why it&rsquo;s important &ldquo;not to leave the market.&rdquo; Attempting to time the market will very likely cause you to miss the days with the biggest gains, leading to long-term returns far worse than those of an investor who &ldquo;never sells.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>On Rebalancing</strong>: Attempting &ldquo;smart,&rdquo; irregular rebalancing based on market movements is <strong>active investing</strong>, which cannot be taught because everyone&rsquo;s judgment criteria are different (add at a 10% drop? or 20%?). This approach can deplete your cash in an extreme market (like a three-year decline), leading to bankruptcy. Therefore, the simplest, safest, and most replicable method is to <strong>rebalance once a year</strong>. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that you didn&rsquo;t add more at the low point in April this year, because by the end of the year, your entire portfolio will still have appreciated significantly.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: For a portfolio of 60% QQQ, 10% QLD, and 30% cash, what is the Beta value? (Teacher&rsquo;s reply: 0.6 + 0.1*2 = 0.8)</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Can one use technical indicators (like the 200-day moving average) to assist in decision-making—becoming conservative when the price is below the average and aggressive when it&rsquo;s above?</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: Are people like Apple CEO Tim Cook considered capitalists or laborers?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>On Technical Indicators</strong>: Completely unnecessary. In the recent V-shaped recovery, using a 200-day moving average strategy would have had you sell and buy back at roughly the same point. Not only would you not have made a profit, you might have lost money on transaction fees, underperforming a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; strategy.</li>
<li><strong>On Tim Cook</strong>: He is a <strong>laborer</strong>, a very highly paid &ldquo;slave.&rdquo; His wealth comes from his salary (including stock options), not from returns on his own invested capital. True capitalists do not have to go to work.</li>

<li>Influenced by family, she previously invested in real estate. Her property in Japan yielded poor returns due to the yen&rsquo;s major depreciation over the last decade.</li>
<li>Shared a success story: she took out a home loan of 8 million TWD four or five years ago and didn&rsquo;t pay it off early. Instead, she invested the funds in ETFs and made a profit of four to five million, deeply understanding the benefits of investing with borrowed money.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: What should she do with the Japanese Yen she holds?</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: She has about $200,000 USD in cash (cost basis ~32 TWD/USD) and has already invested $100,000 in US stocks (QQQ/SPY/VT). Now she doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with the remaining cash because she heard the teacher say there are tax issues for Taiwanese people buying US stocks.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Handling the Yen</strong>: Immediately, right now, exchange it for TWD and buy 00662. Don&rsquo;t worry about the exchange rate loss, because the potential return from the stock market is far greater than currency fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Handling the USD Assets</strong>: Again, ignore the exchange rate. For Taiwanese investors, the best approach is to sell the holdings in the US brokerage, transfer the funds back to Taiwan, and buy 00662 with all of it to avoid future estate tax issues. In the long run, the exchange rates for entering and exiting the market will average out, so there&rsquo;s no need for excessive worry.</li>

All new funds in the future should be invested in QQQ. In the future, Bitcoin might be used as collateral like gold, so you may not need to sell it.

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is 65 and retired. During the recent downturn, his allocation was too aggressive (Beta 1.1), and he had no cash to add at the bottom. He has now adjusted to a Beta of 0.9 (70% QQQ, 10% QLD, 20% Cash).</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Is there a mechanical rule for deploying cash during a major market drop? For example, investing one-third of the cash when the market drops 20%?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This falls under active management. If you must do it, you could consider this: when the market drops 10% (happens almost every year), you can add more once; when it drops 20% (happens every few years), you can add more again. If it continues to fall, you must be very cautious, as it could be a major bear market. At that point, you should switch to a defensive posture, not continue to add. The key is to <strong>never run out of cash</strong>, and the goal of adding to your position is to <strong>maintain your original Beta value (0.9)</strong>, not to raise it.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is due to the <strong>volatility decay</strong> characteristic of leveraged ETFs. In volatile and declining markets, the drop in leveraged ETFs will be more than a multiple of the index&rsquo;s drop, and their recovery is also slower. This is why a full position in leveraged funds is not recommended. For those holding leveraged funds, adding to your position during a major market drop can help you break even faster. For those with a salary, you should normally buy QQQ and use your salary to buy TQQQ during major market dips.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Being out of the market is actually the biggest risk.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This point was central to the entire session. The teacher repeatedly emphasized that compared to the risk of a short-term market decline, the risk of investors exiting out of fear and thereby missing out on huge long-term returns is far greater.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today&rsquo;s laborers who go to work are like the cotton pickers brought from Africa to America in the past. All who work in factories today are slaves to capitalism.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a very sharp and thought-provoking view from the teacher, aimed at awakening people to the nature of capitalism and encouraging them to become capitalists through investment, thereby escaping the status of a &ldquo;laborer.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Longevity is the path to wealth, happiness is the purpose of life, health is the mother of happiness, and wealth is just the icing on the cake.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher shared his philosophy of life, emphasizing what is truly important. Wealth is meant to serve a better life, not be the ultimate goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone says, &ldquo;Pay me 1% and I can be your investment advisor&rdquo;&hellip; that is a scam.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher directly used the language of scammers as an example to strongly remind all students that anyone impersonating him and offering paid financial advice is a scam, urging everyone to protect their assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t defend justice with your own body; we are not martyrs.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This was the core advice given in response to the question about how a child should face school bullying. He stressed that under any circumstances, personal safety is the highest priority, teaching children to uphold their sense of justice while also learning to protect themselves wisely.</p>

<p>This session once again stressed the core discipline of long-term investing: ignore short-term market volatility and firmly believe in the market&rsquo;s long-term upward trend. By analyzing asset allocation, the use of leveraged funds, and debunking common myths like the Buffett Indicator, Teacher James pointed out a simple yet effective path to wealth growth. The Q&amp;A session was rich in content, covering profound discussions from specific investment strategies (like rebalancing timing and leveraged fund allocation) to life philosophies (such as dealing with bullying and the nature of capitalism). The central idea of the entire session is that investors should build a strong psychological foundation, focus on controllable investment principles, and simultaneously pursue a life of health, happiness, and longevity, viewing wealth as a tool for a better life, not the ultimate goal.</p>

<p>This episode mainly discusses how to conduct reasonable asset allocation in the event of market fluctuations. The core idea is: <strong>Invest in the US Nasdaq Index Fund, hold it for the long term, ignore short-term market fluctuations, manage risks well, and adjust the asset allocation ratio according to your own circumstances.</strong> The core lies in establishing an investment mindset that is &ldquo;independent&rdquo; of market fluctuations, with the focus on asset allocation and risk tolerance that suit you.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concentration of Funds:</strong> Concentrate all investable funds into one account to avoid difficulty in grasping the overall asset situation due to scattered accounts. This includes bank deposits, stocks, funds, etc. James emphasizes that you should thoroughly count your assets like &ldquo;counting soldiers painstakingly,&rdquo; so that you know your situation well.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing for Investment:</strong> Actively use tools such as credit and mortgage-linked wealth management loans to use the borrowed funds for investment, and do not let the funds sit idle in the bank &ldquo;blowing cold air.&rdquo; The interest rates on credit and mortgage-linked wealth management loans are usually lower than the yield of US 00864B, so borrowing to invest can generate interest spread. Note:
<ul>
<li><strong>Restrictions on Stock-Pledged Loans:</strong> Should not be used directly for large-scale reinvestment, but can be used in small amounts (e.g., 2%) to supplement funds for &ldquo;beautiful (daily) transfers.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Assess Repayment Ability:</strong> Ensure that monthly available salary is stable for repayment to avoid excessive borrowing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> Include all investable funds (including borrowed funds) in the total assets for unified allocation. This provides a more comprehensive perspective for managing risk and optimizing returns.</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Office Workers:</strong> It is recommended to adopt an asset allocation ratio of 442 or 433. These ratios represent a balance between risk and return, and are suitable for investors with different risk preferences. Among them:
<ul>
<li>442: 40% Index Fund (e.g., QQQ), 40% Leveraged Fund (e.g., QLD), 20% Cash. Suitable for investors with higher risk tolerance.</li>
<li>433 Beta 1.0: 40% Index Fund (e.g., QQQ), 30% Leveraged Fund (Beta 1.0, leveraged fund with lower volatility), 30% Cash. Suitable for investors seeking steady returns.</li>
<li>You can also choose a more conservative configuration of Beta 0.8 or Beta 0.5 to reduce volatility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Do it All at Once:</strong> Asset allocation should be done in one step, without procrastination, to avoid hesitation due to market fluctuations. Execute immediately and don&rsquo;t let &ldquo;hesitation&rdquo; become a stumbling block for investment.</li>
<li><strong>Annual Rebalancing:</strong> Conduct passive rebalancing once a year, instead of actively operating according to market fluctuations. Specific methods:
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Rises:</strong> Transfer one-third of the increased value of the leveraged fund to cash to lock in some profits and reduce portfolio risk.</li>
<li><strong>Market Falls:</strong> Take 2% of total assets from cash and invest in leveraged funds to increase investment during market downturns.</li>
<li><strong>Total Asset Benchmark:</strong> The benchmark for rebalancing is the initially set total asset amount, not the later increased amount, unless the asset allocation is re-evaluated and adjusted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ignore Market Fluctuations:</strong> All investment decisions are independent of market fluctuations, and adhere to a long-term investment strategy. Don&rsquo;t panic because the market is falling, and don&rsquo;t be greedy because the market is rising. James emphasizes that our investment &ldquo;ignores&rdquo; the existence of the market. No matter how the market fluctuates, we adhere to the established asset allocation plan.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Control:</strong> The only controllable risk is raising the cash position. Other systematic risks (such as war, economic crisis, etc.) cannot be controlled. Trying to control systematic risks is futile. Even Buffett can only cope by increasing cash reserves.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Tolerance:</strong> Test your own risk tolerance through market declines, and choose the Beta value that suits you. Market declines are the best time to test whether asset allocation is reasonable, and also a great opportunity to understand your own risk tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>Beta Value Selection:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Beta 1.2: High volatility, suitable for investors with high risk tolerance.</li>
<li>Beta 1.0: Moderate volatility.</li>
<li>Beta 0.8 or lower: Low volatility, suitable for investors with low risk tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>Drop Two Levels:</strong> If you feel too much pressure during a market downturn, it is recommended to drop two levels on the Beta value that you currently think is safe to ensure a more comfortable investment experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Chasing Highs and Selling Lows:</strong> After determining the Beta value, do not change it frequently to avoid chasing highs and selling lows. Frequent changes in the Beta value will lead to confusion in the investment strategy, which may eventually outweigh the benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> Regardless of the asset allocation adopted, the cash ratio should be maintained at 20% or higher. This provides a sufficient safety buffer to cope with emergencies.</li>

<li><strong>Family Drama:</strong> Understand the complexity of family relationships. Everyone has their own role. Learn to use wisdom to deal with family financial problems. Family financial problems are common. Every family is like a big drama, and the roles and scripts have been set long ago.</li>
<li><strong>Decluttering:</strong> Learn to declutter, don&rsquo;t over-contribute, be selfish a little when necessary, and protect your own interests. Especially when it comes to taking care of parents, clearly define the division of responsibilities to avoid taking on too much burden alone for a long time.</li>
<li><strong>Communicate Early:</strong> The sooner you communicate with siblings about sharing parental expenses and care responsibilities, the easier it is to reach a consensus and avoid future conflicts.</li>

<li>Question:
<ol>
<li>401K company match, so 401K can transfer to traditional IRO. But if you want to earn ROS, you must be in a situation where the tax rate is very low, and there is no way to directly save. Is the logic correct that you can only transfer to rus to invest from there after we both retire?</li>
<li>If we just sell our cash property houses and cash, and then directly deposit that investment, is that right?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Try to allocate your 401K as much as possible and allocate it to R. Because the company&rsquo;s Dr has nothing to do with income. Whether you want to transfer your old traditional to R401K depends on your tax rate. Give you a number and calculate it with you now. You should convert how much each year. James emphasizes that you can determine whether to convert based on the calculation. Based on the current volume of 800,000 US dollars, if it is covered with an annualized return of 12% in 15 years, you need to convert 100,000 US dollars each year. If you retire five years later and use 220,000 US dollars for tax filing, the tax rate will be higher. You should retire early to do the convert.</li>
<li>You can put it in brokerage. You can just put it directly, right? It is still worth putting it. James suggests starting investing as soon as possible and not letting cash sit idle.</li>

<li>Question: Mortgage-linked wealth management loans can be used to borrow new ones to repay old ones. 75 years old can continue to borrow cyclically. 45 years old still has 30 years. Is there a better way to use this? With 33 times the annual spending in assets, can selling rental houses to achieve 40 times allow you to stop working? A two-times leveraged QQQ in Canada has a small scale. Is it safe?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>You should just go and borrow it without hesitation, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t want me to repay it, or ask me to repay it after 40 years. As long as you invest for more than 15 years, you cannot lose money, so 30 years is guaranteed to have at least a 9% return, so there is no problem. The key is that you have to persist long enough and not be affected by market fluctuations, which is more important. How will you feel if the market you borrow from this mortgage-linked wealth management loan falls by 20% from today? Just ask yourself. If you are okay, then it is okay.</li>
<li>Living off 2-3% of your current QQQ and SPY (75% and 25%) is better than selling the rental house.</li>
<li>The safety of the ETF has nothing to do with its volume. As long as you can buy and sell it, it&rsquo;s fine.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cost of Capital:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Three common types of loans in China:
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Credit Loan:</strong> For individuals with stable jobs, such as civil servants. No collateral is required.  Borrowers can obtain 200,000 to 300,000 RMB with an annual interest rate of around 3%.  Typically, only interest is paid for the first three years, followed by principal repayment.</li>
<li><strong>Mortgage-backed Business Loan:</strong> Requires the borrower to have a business.  Real estate is used as collateral.  It is possible to arrange a loan where only interest is paid for the first ten years, followed by principal repayment.  The current lowest annual interest rate can reach 2.4%.</li>
<li><strong>Broker Stock Financing:</strong> Financing services provided by brokers.  Currently, friendly brokers in China can offer an annual interest rate of 4%, which can be reduced to 3.6% depending on the asset amount.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stock financing is the best borrowing method. The key is that the principal can be extended indefinitely, interest accrual can be deferred indefinitely, and the loan duration is considered 0.  This means that, in theory, the principal never needs to be repaid; only interest needs to be paid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choosing the Best Broker:</strong> Compare the fees and interest charging methods of different brokers.  Choose the broker with the lowest interest rate and the most favorable repayment policy.</li>
<li><strong>Familiarize Yourself with Stock Financing Rules:</strong> Understand concepts like margin ratio, warning line, and liquidation line to avoid the risk of forced liquidation due to improper operation. Stock financing is essentially borrowing money to speculate in stocks, and high-leverage operations should be approached with caution.</li>
<li><strong>Coordinate the General Account and Margin Account:</strong> Understand the rules for transferring funds and stocks between the two accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Combine the &ldquo;Never Sell Nasdaq&rdquo; and &ldquo;Never Repay Debt&rdquo; Strategies:</strong> Use long-term holdings of the Nasdaq as collateral to utilize low-cost financing for other investments or consumption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Specific Operation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Having over 500,000 RMB in Nasdaq assets allows you to open a stock financing account (margin account) with a broker.</li>
<li>Transfer the Nasdaq ETF (e.g., 513100) from the general account to the margin account as collateral.</li>
<li>Example using 10% financing:
<ul>
<li>Use the financing to buy 100,000 RMB worth of Nasdaq ETF.</li>
<li>After the transaction is completed, transfer the ETF to the general account through collateral transfer (can only be transferred on the second trading day).</li>
<li>Sell the Nasdaq ETF in the general account to obtain cash, which can be used for other investments or consumption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most brokers offer a six-month extension service, which can theoretically be extended indefinitely as long as interest is paid on time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Considerations When Choosing a Broker:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Calculation Method:</strong> Some brokers calculate interest including the start date but excluding the end date, while others include both. The latter will charge one more day of interest.</li>
<li><strong>Whether Unpaid Interest Incurs Penalties:</strong> Pay attention to the broker&rsquo;s charging policy for interest overdrafts.</li>
<li><strong>Whether Unpaid Interest is Included in Debt (Simple/Compound Interest):</strong> The best situation is simple interest accounting, where unpaid interest does not accrue to the financing debt.</li>
<li>Summary: Find a broker with low interest, simple interest accounting, and where unpaid interest is not transferred to the financing debt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Familiarize Yourself with Financing Rules (Focus on Margin Ratio):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Margin Ratio = Total Account Assets / Total Financing Amount.</li>
<li>Only stocks with a margin ratio exceeding 300% can be transferred to the general account, indicating that excessive borrowing prevents transfers.</li>
<li><strong>Warning Line:</strong> If the margin ratio is 150%, the broker will notify you to add margin or make a repayment.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidation Line:</strong> If the margin ratio is 130%, the broker will forcibly liquidate, selling stocks to repay the debt.</li>
<li>Example:
<ul>
<li>1 million RMB in Nasdaq, financed 100,000 RMB, transfer 100,000 RMB worth of Nasdaq to the general account.</li>
<li>Margin Ratio = 1 million RMB / 100,000 RMB = 1000%, very safe.</li>
<li>If 513100 drops 85%, the total account assets remaining are 150,000 RMB, and the margin ratio reaches 150%, triggering the warning line.</li>
<li>If 513100 drops 87%, the total account assets remaining are 130,000 RMB, and the margin ratio reaches 130%, triggering the liquidation line.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Why Do This:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Chinese Broker Rules: If there is cash in the margin account, it will be used to repay the stock loan principal first.</li>
<li>By transferring the financed Nasdaq to the general account and selling it, you can obtain cash.</li>
<li>There is no capital gains tax in China, and the commission is extremely low, as low as 0.05% for some brokers.</li>
<li>The operation is completely compliant and in accordance with the broker&rsquo;s financing rules.</li>
<li>It is recommended that the stock pledge ratio should not exceed 10%, which is considered a safe leverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Operational Precautions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Always keep zero cash in the margin account.</li>
<li>When you need to invest more funds to buy 513100, transfer the funds to the general account to purchase and then transfer them to the margin account.</li>
<li>When you need to borrow money and sell stocks, transfer the financed portion to the general account to sell and convert it to cash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Thanks to Teacher James&rsquo; selfless dedication, taking the elimination of poverty as his lifelong career.</li>
<li>Sharing being &ldquo;electrified&rdquo; by the 00451 video, agreeing with its underlying logic and belief, buying all 513100 and holding it for the long term.</li>
<li>Thinking about how to borrow low-cost &ldquo;garbage&rdquo; (debt) and convert it into assets, let the assets grow by compound interest, never sell, let the debt be accounted for by simple interest and never be repaid, at most borrow new debt to repay old debt, to ensure that the assets are not damaged.</li>
<li>Amazed that Teacher James&rsquo; investment system continues to evolve, from the initial 70% QQQ to InQQQ, and then integrating credit, stock pledges, leveraged funds, and cash to form an all-around large-scale operational system across sea, land, and air.</li>
<li>Due to the imperfect financial tools in China, there are no stock pledges and leveraged funds, so it can only stay at the Nasdaq credit stage, and the power is greatly reduced.</li>
<li>Emphasize practicing internal strength, learning Teacher James&rsquo; investment philosophy and spirit, combining it with the domestic financial environment, integrating it, and driving it with profound internal strength.</li>
<li>Supplement the comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of stock pledge/financing from the perspective of learning, thinking, and practice:
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxation:</strong> The United States has a capital gains tax, while the securities account in China is similar to the American ROTH IRA, which is tax-free. Nasdaq assets grow by compound interest, and financing is accounted for by simple interest, doubling the happiness.</li>
<li><strong>Interest:</strong> The interest rate on stock pledges in the United States is relatively high, currently about 7%+, and it is compounded into the debt; the interest rate on stock financing in China is relatively low, about 4%, with simple interest accounting, which is more cost-effective in the long run.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Stock pledges in the United States can only be used for consumption, with a safety buffer, and are relatively stable; currently, in China, it can only be used by converting stock financing into cash for consumption, which is riskier and requires strict control of the proportion within 10%.</li>
<li><strong>Humanity:</strong> Emphasize controlling risks, including controlling humanity. Greed when rising, fear when falling. The teacher changed from the previous 20% M to strictly prohibiting financing, because when the number of people increases, it is difficult to comply with the safety margin, and fear will be amplified when it falls.</li>
<li><strong>Principle:</strong> Financial tools are neutral, and the risk lies in the user.</li>

<li>Sharing: Supplementing the premise of stock pledge borrowing in mainland China, there may be policy risks with brokers, who may require immediate debt repayment at any time. Therefore, it is necessary to always keep enough cash to cover the debt.

<li>Teacher James&rsquo; Comment: Emphasizes that borrowing should not exceed 10%, otherwise, it is not meaningful.  If you buy leveraged funds in Hong Kong and keep a certain proportion of cash, you can break through the 10% limit and achieve a similar effect to the American 442.</li>

<li>Question 1: For the 442 asset allocation, when it falls, you need to add 2% to QLD, but LIIA can only put in $7,000 per year, which is not enough.  How to deal with it? Should a portion of the two layers of cash be placed in LIIA?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply:
<ul>
<li>No.  Keep cash in a Traditional IRA or Brokerage Account, preferably in a Traditional IRA for better tax benefits.</li>
<li>Do a Conversion, from IRA to Roth IRA to add leverage, especially when the market falls, it is more beneficial to do Conversion.  Transferring the same 100 shares of QQQ requires less funds when it falls.</li>
<li>Or convert QLD to TQQQ, but it is not recommended.  If you must do this, calculate how much QLD needs to be converted to TQQQ to achieve 2% leverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Two weeks ago, the teacher said that QQQ would rise higher after the adjustment.  In these two weeks, QQQ has declined.  Did the teacher see the phenomenon and predict the adjustment, or did he just say it casually, and it happened to fall?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply: Unspeakable, don&rsquo;t know.  Even if I knew, I wouldn&rsquo;t say.  The key is that you should not try to predict the market.  Even if you have escaped a few bubbles, you cannot guarantee that you will succeed every time.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply:
<ul>
<li>You can choose 442 or 433. 442 is more aggressive and suitable for young people.</li>
<li>442 is 40% QQQ/006200, 40% QLD/00679L, 20% cash 864B.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply:
<ul>
<li>It is very normal to move towards a truly world-class company.  Don&rsquo;t worry, the company&rsquo;s decisions are based on maximizing its own interests.</li>
<li>It is normal to set up R&amp;D in the United States.  Whether it surpasses Taiwan is not important.  It is all for TSMC&rsquo;s use.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use it too outrageously.  Does Microsoft need to explain to all Americans when it opens an R&amp;D center in Taiwan?  TSMC should not be linked to the &ldquo;national protection mountain.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t have a small-country mentality. You should be happy that TSMC has become a world-class company.</li>

<li>BXMX is tax-free.  People with dividend tax need to use BXMX, which can be used to legally avoid taxes in the United States.</li>

<ul>
<li>People nearing retirement can consider using a revolving line of credit home loan (HELOC), treating the credit line as a part of their cash reserves for living expenses without touching the principal investment, thereby increasing overall asset returns.  For example, if someone has $40 million in retirement funds and obtains a $10 million HELOC, the total assets become $50 million, and the annual disposable funds increase from $800,000 to $1 million.</li>
<li>The HELOC credit line can supplement the 20% cash portion of asset allocation.</li>
<li>Note: It&rsquo;s easier to obtain a HELOC before retirement; it becomes more difficult afterward. The loan term typically doesn&rsquo;t exceed age 90.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not recommended to take out a loan after retirement to repay the HELOC.</li>

<li>Sharing: After following James&rsquo;s advice, she redeemed funds from savings insurance and invested in QQQ and QLD. However, due to insufficient trading frequency, she couldn&rsquo;t purchase QQQ 2D. Her current living expenses are primarily covered by alimony, and the cost of living in Taiwan is relatively low.</li>
<li>Question 1: Does she need to buy and sell repeatedly to meet the trading frequency requirement?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes, she can make small, frequent trades to meet the brokerage&rsquo;s requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Can she buy fractional shares in Taiwan?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes, but it&rsquo;s recommended to buy whole shares first and use the remaining funds for fractional shares.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: How to calculate retirement fund needs?  Can she receive social security?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Calculate retirement fund needs based on annual expenses. Alimony can be considered income, but it&rsquo;s recommended to claim social security (even if her ex-husband objects) and adjust the asset allocation ratio accordingly, as alimony is not a permanent income source. She needs to be prepared.  Also recommended switching from SWVXX to BOXX.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: Discussed the psychological pressure of buying after a stock reaches new highs. Experienced investors feel more pressure due to having reference points, while newcomers are more receptive. Like buying discounted items in a supermarket, having the original price as a reference makes purchasing more appealing.</li>

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Doesn&rsquo;t recommend investing in unfamiliar ETFs, even if they perform well.  Stick to investments within your circle of competence.

<p>This session revolves around investment and life planning. The core ideas are: be optimistic about investment and keep learning, ignoring short-term market fluctuations; young people should focus on asset appreciation, with Nasdaq 100 index funds being the top choice; utilize leverage and allocate assets reasonably; retirees should plan carefully and avoid excessive debt; and one should stay optimistic and confident, avoid material comparisons, and pursue true freedom.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market Fluctuations and Investment Mentality:</strong> The market is always fluctuating. Don&rsquo;t let short-term fluctuations affect your investment decisions. Stay optimistic.</li>
<li><strong>Currency Devaluation and Asset Appreciation:</strong> Money depreciates; only assets like stocks can preserve and increase in value. Currency devaluation is more severe in emerging countries, so it is advised to convert currency into assets. Taiwan&rsquo;s low wages and currency devaluation are related to the government&rsquo;s subsidy policies.</li>
<li><strong>Worker Mindset vs. Capitalist Mindset:</strong> Workers exchange labor for depreciating currency, while capitalists exchange currency for appreciating assets. Learn to invest and become a capitalist, exchanging &ldquo;trash&rdquo; (depreciating currency) for assets.</li>
<li><strong>Global Market Linkage:</strong> Global markets are highly interconnected, and diversifying investments into other regions has limited effectiveness. Focusing on the US stock market is recommended.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nasdaq 100 Index Funds:</strong> The preferred choice for young people. Long-term investment can yield substantial returns.  Global codes for purchasing Nasdaq 100 index funds were provided, and investing based on market conditions is recommended.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Cash:</strong> Cash reserves are crucial. 00864B and money market funds (like SWVXX, VOXX) are safeguards and should not be replaced with high-dividend products like SPHD, as principal safety is paramount.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Rebalancing:</strong> Suitable for those who use leveraged funds, are not retired, and have income.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Real Estate Investment:</strong> Housing prices in the Bay Area are high, putting great pressure on young people to buy houses, which can easily lead to financial difficulties. Renting is recommended to maintain flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing and Investment:</strong> Loans, mortgages, and car loans should be repaid with stable cash flow, not relying on stock market returns.</li>
<li><strong>Retirement Planning:</strong> Retirees should be cautious about borrowing and make plans based on the size of their retirement funds.  If retirement funds are 50 times the annual expenses, two options are available: 1. Keep the mortgage and car loan, using 2% of the retirement fund annually to cover all expenses; 2. Pay off the mortgage and car loan, invest 80% of the remaining funds in 00662, 20% in 00864B, and use 2% of the total funds annually for living expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation Case Study:</strong> A case study with 45 million Taiwan dollars illustrated asset allocation strategies when withdrawals are not needed. An 80/20 allocation or a combination of leveraged funds (60% 00662, 20% 00670L, 20% 00864B) is recommended.  For those with stable income and no need to withdraw from investments, 100% investment in QQQ can be considered.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: Read &ldquo;Investing is Asset Allocation, What You Don&rsquo;t Know,&rdquo; agreeing with the importance of accumulating the first pot of gold early; learning investment allows for more focus on work and personal improvement, spending time each day learning new skills and increasing self-worth.  Investment enables people to be more motivated to improve their professional skills rather than &ldquo;lying flat.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Individuals can improve their earning potential through learning, even if their investment assets are reduced to zero, they can still rely on professional skills to make a comeback.</li>
<li>Question 1: What should I do if the Beta value is very low when the asset value plummets in the Excel sheet?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: The sheet is designed for acceleration during market rises and deceleration during falls. A low Beta value is normal and a reflection of risk control; no adjustment is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Even knowing that investment should be mindless, I still worry when the Beta value drops. How should I cope?

<li>Question 2: Is it feasible to regularly invest equal amounts in QQQ and 2X leverage?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Feasible, but pay attention to cash reserves. A Beta of 1.1 or 1.2 allocation is recommended, adjusting according to market conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: Can a child&rsquo;s Lunar New Year money be all-in on 2X leverage?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: If you can guarantee continuous regular investment for more than 30 years, it&rsquo;s worth considering, but be aware of the risks and be able to withstand significant asset shrinkage.  In the long run, the returns can be substantial, but psychological barriers must be overcome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 4: Are the views of online influencers recommending treasury bonds correct? Are treasury bonds more valuable during a market crash?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Incorrect. During market downturns, bond declines can be even greater.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Rise faster, fall slower.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of James&rsquo;s core investment philosophies. Through smart rebalancing strategies, increase investment during market rises to accelerate profits, and reduce investment during market downturns to mitigate losses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Money is the least valuable thing when it has no value.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This reflects James&rsquo;s unique view on wealth. When wealth accumulates to a certain extent, the value of money itself is no longer important; what matters more is pursuing freedom and happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want freedom, and you want privacy, you will not have freedom. In the future world, if you want privacy, you will not have freedom.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This shows James&rsquo;s insight into future social trends. In the high-tech era, one needs to make trade-offs between privacy and freedom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more daring one is to borrow money, the broader their perspective.
&ndash; YJ Yuanlin</p></blockquote>
<p>YJ Yuanlin&rsquo;s sharing led to James&rsquo;s views on borrowing: good debt can help wealth growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want freedom, you cannot care.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Echoing the topic of Elon Musk supporting Trump and the entrepreneurial spirit, true freedom is not caring about external opinions and focusing on one&rsquo;s goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t use ChatGPT now, you are outdated and will be eliminated.

<p>James advocates for new technologies and maintains an open attitude towards learning new things.</p>

<p>The session centered on the core principle of long-term investment strategies. James reiterated his investment philosophy: &ldquo;Buy QQQ whenever you have money and hold it for the long term.&rdquo; The discussion expanded to cover aspects like investment philosophy, risk management, and values, incorporating current events and questions from attendees. James also shared insights from legendary investors like Warren Buffett, encouraging attendees to cultivate a sound investment mindset.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Buying at the Dip vs. Buying When You Have Money:</strong> James cited research from ChatGPT, indicating that even with the ability to accurately predict and buy at market dips, the long-term returns differed minimally compared to simply buying when one has available funds. Over a 20-year period, the difference was merely 8%, translating to a difference in annualized returns of less than 0.2%. Hence, rather than expending time and effort predicting market bottoms, it&rsquo;s more effective to seize opportunities and buy QQQ when you have the money.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Leveraged Funds:</strong>  Using the 2000 tech bubble as an example, James explained how leveraged funds can accelerate losses in bear markets, potentially leading to devastating financial setbacks, even bankruptcy. He simulated a scenario where an investor repeatedly buys more leveraged funds as the market declines, culminating in financial ruin. This served as a cautionary tale against the &ldquo;buy the dip&rdquo; strategy with leveraged funds, emphasizing the importance of risk management.</li>
<li><strong>Keys to Investment Success:</strong> James emphasized that the key to successful investment lies in overcoming human weaknesses. Maintaining a detached and &ldquo;unfeeling&rdquo; attitude towards invested capital and short-term market fluctuations is crucial for adhering to a long-term investment approach.</li>
<li><strong>Market Cycles:</strong> James stated he wouldn&rsquo;t teach attendees about predicting market cycles or any trading techniques. He considers these unimportant and prone to misinterpretation and misapplication, potentially leading to increased risks. He advocated for a long-term investment strategy, likening it to riding a cable car, a smooth and steady ascent to the summit of financial success.</li>
<li><strong>Money and Values:</strong> Acknowledging that individuals have different values regarding money, James advised understanding and respecting diverse values, discouraging attempts to impose one&rsquo;s own values upon others. He used the example shared by an attendee about a mother preferring a financial subsidy over a family trip to illustrate the diverse ways people assign value to things.</li>

<p><strong>IIM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong> A story about a deceased friend, leading to reflections on money and values, and expressing confusion about balancing personal values with those of others.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  How to understand some people&rsquo;s &ldquo;frugality&rdquo; with money while being &ldquo;generous&rdquo; towards their pets.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> People manage their finances differently based on what they consider important and valuable. What might be significant to one person may hold little value for another.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> How to understand a mother who prioritizes money over a family trip? How to better understand the needs of others?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>  This mother might have certain unmet needs, possibly requiring material security before pursuing leisurely experiences. Understanding true needs involves offering more choices (e.g., money plus a trip). Avoid trying to change others&rsquo; values; focus on understanding and respecting them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong> Encountering a friend who suggested leveraging to purchase Nvidia stock, leading to questions about investment advice.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How to evaluate investment advice received from others?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>   The validity of investment advice depends on individual judgment and risk tolerance. It&rsquo;s important to avoid blindly following the advice of others and to think independently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Iny:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Experiencing a sense of calm and reduced anxiety after adopting James&rsquo;s investment approach.  This newfound peace of mind allows for dedicating more time to important matters like family, and interestingly, focusing on work has led to increased income.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to understand the phenomenon of increased income resulting from a dedicated focus on work?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> This exemplifies the principle that altruism ultimately benefits oneself. By focusing on serving clients and enhancing product or service quality, one ultimately gains client recognition and rewards, leading to higher income and a sense of accomplishment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Haoqing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared 1:</strong>  An experience with check fraud, prompting concerns about bank security and the risks of using checks.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>  Banks do not verify the identity of check depositors. Checks present security vulnerabilities, making it advisable to use safer online banking and digital payment methods like Apple Pay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Shared 2:</strong> Thoughts on the decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia, attributing this to factors like US regulations, labor laws, and unions.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> The decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia are multifaceted issues stemming from a complex interplay of factors, including national policies, labor laws, and unions. While Asian countries might resort to suppressing labor rights and environmental regulations to gain a competitive edge, the US places a higher value on worker well-being and environmental protection. This divergence in values contributes to different developmental paths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Becky:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong> Based on personal experience working in a digital payment company, Becky recommended that everyone stop using checks due to inherent security risks. Digital payment methods offer greater security and convenience, with features such as spending alerts that enable prompt response and recovery in case of issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong> As a long-time follower of James, Mike witnessed the evolution of his investment philosophy, from initially holding 30% SPY to converting to 100% QQQ, and eventually incorporating leveraged funds. He also shared personal investment experiences, like selling NIO and allocating a portion of his portfolio to private market investments.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Is investing in Intel after its acquisition worthwhile?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>  James advised against investing in large companies that are acquisitive. Acquisitions often lack efficiency, posing integration challenges and potentially hindering productivity. While acquiring smaller companies for technological advantages makes sense, acquiring large companies is akin to amassing a pile of scrap metal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong>  How to view the supply chain security concerns stemming from the US outsourcing 3C product manufacturing, citing examples like the BBB Call explosion and walkie-talkie incidents?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Espionage is ubiquitous, and supply chain security is just one facet of this broader issue. Governments might implant spy codes in chips and software for surveillance purposes. Explosions are a relatively rudimentary form of espionage; more sophisticated methods can be extremely difficult to detect and prevent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> Is it possible to offer advanced courses for more experienced attendees? He suggested using portfolio sharing as a means to differentiate attendees&rsquo; learning progress.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> James stated he wouldn&rsquo;t differentiate between attendees nor offer advanced courses. Assessing whether a student is genuinely learning is primarily based on their attitude, not investment returns or holding duration. Even portfolio sharing can&rsquo;t truly gauge learning progress. James mentioned his personal sensitivity to words and language, enabling him to discern learning attitudes from attendees&rsquo; emails and the way they pose questions.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The best time to buy is when you have money.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Many obsess over finding the perfect entry point, but research indicates that even if you could perfectly time market dips, the long-term returns barely differ from simply buying when funds are available. Instead of wasting time trying to predict the market, seize the opportunity and act promptly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To succeed in investing, you must be indifferent to the money you invest and the fluctuations in stock prices.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Overcoming the human tendency to fixate on money and fear short-term market swings is essential for maintaining a long-term investment strategy and achieving stable returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To achieve effortless investing, you need to be numb to money.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>When investing becomes a habit, free from emotional impulses and external distractions, you can achieve optimal results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept of a &ldquo;benefactor&rdquo; is relative.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>People perceive and absorb information differently. Who you consider a benefactor might not be perceived as such by others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to change other people&rsquo;s values.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone has their own values and ways of life. It&rsquo;s important to understand and respect diverse choices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Espionage is everywhere.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Information security is a growing concern. Be vigilant and protect your personal data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Acquisitions of large companies are generally inefficient, and leaders who are fond of acquisitions usually have inflated egos.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Integration complexities and high management costs associated with mergers often outweigh the benefits gained.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The US excels in areas such as finance and technology design, while Asian countries can only substitute and supplement in specific aspects.
&ndash; Haoqing</p></blockquote>
<p>Within the global division of labor, different countries have distinct strengths and weaknesses, leading to divergent paths of development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best judgments are validated by facts.
&ndash; Mike</p></blockquote>
<p>The success of an investment philosophy is ultimately determined by its long-term returns, not short-term fluctuations or gut feelings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your attitude determines my response.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>James adjusts his responses based on the learning attitude of the attendees. Attendees who are truly dedicated to learning will receive greater guidance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investing in individual stocks will ultimately lead to bankruptcy; holding onto individual stocks will also ultimately lead to bankruptcy.<br>
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Companies have lifecycles.  Holding onto a single stock long term significantly increases the risk of encountering bankruptcy. Diversification is key in investing.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Investment Objective:</strong> Identify high-quality investment targets, such as market-capitalization-weighted index funds, and hold them for the long term. Avoid chasing high-return investment targets, as excessive volatility may lead to an inability to hold, ultimately hindering returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Risk Control:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not overestimate your risk tolerance, as market downturns often exceed expectations.</li>
<li>Selling leads to permanent losses; the only mistake in the market is selling.</li>
<li>Investing is a process that goes against human nature, requiring the overcoming of fear and greed.</li>
<li>Always ensure survival in extreme market conditions, meaning possessing sufficient cash flow to sustain living expenses.</li>
<li>Holding cash is crucial for mitigating risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investment Mindset:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Investors should remain perpetually optimistic, believing that the market will eventually rise.</li>
<li>Be patient, as wealth accumulation takes time.</li>
<li>Do not be swayed by short-term market fluctuations; adhere to a long-term investment strategy.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to predict the market, and ignore market noise.</li>
<li>Keep investing simple: buy when you have money and hold for the long term; avoid excessive trading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Allocation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The highest guiding principle of asset allocation is: you can still survive under extreme market conditions.</li>
<li>Retirees need to hold more cash and can utilize leveraged funds to enhance returns while reducing risks.</li>
<li>Employed individuals can choose different asset allocation plans based on their circumstances, but ensure a certain proportion of cash holdings.</li>
<li>Do not alter your asset allocation based on market ups and downs, as this constitutes short-term trading behavior.</li>
<li>Asset allocation needs to be adjusted based on individual situations. For example, when significant events like retirement or purchasing a house occur, reassessment and adjustment of the asset allocation plan are necessary.</li>
<li>Leverage initially carries higher risk, which gradually decreases as the market rises.</li>
<li>It is recommended that retirement accounts comprise at least 30% of total assets to effectively avoid taxes during rebalancing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Market Efficiency:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The market is efficient; it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to find opportunities for consistent excess returns.</li>
<li>Do not readily believe investment strategies claiming to achieve excess returns, as they are often unsustainable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Role of Wall Street:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wall Street&rsquo;s primary roles are to provide liquidity and investment products, establish the framework for investment transactions, and lower the barriers to entry, allowing ordinary investors to participate.</li>
<li>Investors need to understand how Wall Street operates to avoid falling into its traps.</li>
<li>Market makers are a crucial part of Wall Street. They profit by providing bid-ask spreads while also offering liquidity to the market.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><strong>IM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Black swan events remind us that people are forgetful, easily becoming optimistic during market upswings and panicking during downturns.</li>
<li>Question: How to control optimism and avoid overconfidence leading to bankruptcy?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response: Remember the highest guiding principle of asset allocation, ensuring survival under extreme conditions. Cash is the lifeline for survival.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sunny:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: How to persuade people around me not to purchase insurance and financial products?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response: By calculating the annualized return rate of insurance products and comparing it with the return rates of other investment products, you can demonstrate that insurance and financial products offer lower returns. You can compare the return rates of insurance products with the long-term returns of index funds and point out that the income source for insurance companies and insurance agents is the premiums paid by customers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Experienced Apple Vision Pro and found its spatial computing capabilities impressive, but currently, it has limited functionality and applications, along with a high price tag.</li>
<li>Question: If investing is so simple, what is the role of Wall Street experts?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response: Wall Street&rsquo;s role primarily lies in providing liquidity, investment products, and the trading infrastructure, lowering the barriers to entry, enabling ordinary investors to participate in the market. Market makers are an essential component of Wall Street, making profits by providing bid-ask spreads while also offering liquidity to the market.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: How can employed individuals utilize the asset allocation plan in Scenario 9?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response: Scenario 9 is suitable for retired individuals with loans. If you are employed and have substantial loans, such as a mortgage, you need to adjust the plan based on your circumstances. For example, pay off a portion of the loan before proceeding with asset allocation. Moreover, leverage carries higher risk initially, which gradually decreases as the market rises.</li>
<li>Question: How to allocate and rebalance assets between a 401K account and a Roth IRA account?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response: It&rsquo;s recommended that retirement accounts comprise at least 30% of total assets for effective tax avoidance during rebalancing. Due to the limited investment options within a 401K account, direct purchase of QQQ may not be possible. You can use similar alternatives or transfer funds to a Roth IRA account for more flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Yingying:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: What&rsquo;s the difference between QQQ and QQQM?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response: The market is efficient. There won&rsquo;t be a significant difference in the long-term returns of QQQ and QQQM. Choose QQQ, which has lower fees.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Should I convert 0066 to 00670L during a market downturn?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response: Do not change your asset allocation based on market fluctuations, as this constitutes short-term trading behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using Fatality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s response: Charles Schwab is recommended because it is both a brokerage and a bank, offering higher security. Fidelity only has brokerage services and lacks a banking license, potentially facing risks during financial crises.</li>
</ul>
