<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Differences between CLEC Investment and Market Books, Influencers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Strategy:</strong> CLEC uses the NASDAQ 100 Index Fund (QQQ) as its core, combined with leveraged funds (QLD) and bank pledges for asset allocation, targeting an annualized return of 12%~20%.</li>
<li><strong>Traditional Investment Education:</strong> Usually only emphasizes large-cap index investing (such as VOO, SPY) or value investing, rarely mentions leveraged funds, and even less involves specific capital operation strategies (such as stock pledges).</li>
<li><strong>Influencer Finance:</strong> Often oversimplifies investing or recommends various immature investment targets (such as newly issued ETFs), lacking systematicity and risk control.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Freedom Strategy:</strong> CLEC provides a clear path to financial freedom, including when to start stock pledges, the amount that can be safely withdrawn each year, and how to achieve financial freedom through capital operations, rather than just &ldquo;saving money + investing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Practicality and Executability:</strong> CLEC provides concrete and actionable plans, such as how much assets you need to reach to start pledging, how to adjust asset allocation according to market conditions, while many books and courses only have theory and lack practical guidance.</li>
<li><strong>Capital Operation:</strong> CLEC emphasizes capital operation through bank credit, wealth management mortgages, stock pledges, etc., to achieve the goal of &ldquo;borrowing money to invest, borrowing money to spend, and asset appreciation,&rdquo; which is rarely involved in traditional investment education and influencer finance.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Emphasizes risk control and has specific coping methods in the event of a downturn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comparison with Common Investment Books:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;The Psychology of Money&rdquo;:</strong> Emphasizes long-term investing and saving, but CLEC goes a step further by accelerating wealth accumulation through leverage and capital operations.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&rdquo;:</strong> Advocates investing in the broad market index (SPY), but CLEC believes that QQQ has more growth potential and combines leveraged funds and cash for asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Buffett:</strong> Buffett is the representative of value investing, requiring in-depth research on companies and industries, while CLEC believes that ordinary people do not need to have professional knowledge and only need to invest in index funds.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&rdquo;:</strong> Focuses on real estate investment, while CLEC believes that stock investment and capital operations are more efficient and does not recommend investing in real estate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investor Growth Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beginner Stage:</strong> Learn and practice long-term investing principles, and don&rsquo;t panic and sell (already in the top 20% of the market).</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Stage:</strong> Learn and use leveraged funds and stock pledges (top 20% of the market).</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Stage:</strong> Proficient in stock pledges, cash flow management, and asset allocation, and fearless of market fluctuations (top 1% of the market).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Core Investment Philosophy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mission:</strong> To awaken the capital awareness of ordinary people and help them achieve financial freedom, rather than for traffic and making money.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Target:</strong> Focus on investing in QQQ, believing in the long-term development of American technology.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage Use:</strong> Reasonably use leveraged funds (QLD) to magnify returns, but strictly control risk and avoid short-term operations.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Rebalancing:</strong> According to market ups and downs, dynamically adjust between QQQ and cash (or short-term bonds) to achieve &ldquo;buy low and sell high.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledge:</strong> Obtain cash flow through stock pledge to achieve &ldquo;consuming without selling stocks&rdquo; and ensure continuous asset appreciation.</li>
<li><strong>Simple and Effective:</strong> The investment strategy is simple and easy to understand, can be executed in the long term, does not require monitoring the market, and does not require stock picking.</li>

<p><strong>Sharing:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A-share NASDAQ ETF Premium Issue:</strong> Elaborated in detail the fundamental reasons for the premium of domestic A-share NASDAQ ETFs (such as 513100, 159941, etc.):
<ul>
<li><strong>Foreign Exchange Control:</strong> China implements foreign exchange control, and each fund company has a state-approved quota. The quotas of old fund companies are usually tight, resulting in limited off-site subscriptions (suspension or limits), and investors can only turn to buying ETFs on the market, which pushes up on-site prices and forms a premium.</li>
<li><strong>Market Sentiment:</strong> The A-share market is easily affected by policies, hot spots, and other factors, and rapid capital flows can lead to violent fluctuations in the premium of the NASDAQ ETF. For example, when the market pursues other hot sectors, funds may withdraw from the NASDAQ ETF, leading to a decrease in the premium or even a discount.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Trends:</strong> In the long run, due to the existence of foreign exchange controls and investors&rsquo; continued optimism about the NASDAQ, the premium will exist for a long time. However, in the short term, the premium will be affected by market sentiment and capital flows.</li>
<li><strong>On-site and Off-site Differences:</strong> The same fund has different codes and trading methods on-site (exchange-traded funds, ETFs) and off-site (subscribed and redeemed through the fund company). Off-site subscriptions are usually based on the fund&rsquo;s net value, while on-site transaction prices are affected by supply and demand, which may result in premiums or discounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Investors:</strong> The premium of the A-share NASDAQ ETF is unfavorable to ordinary investors, especially buying at a higher premium, which increases the investment cost.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Recommendations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long-Term Investing:</strong> If it is a long-term investment, there is no need to worry too much about short-term premium fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Be Cautious When the Premium is Too High:</strong> When the premium is too high (such as exceeding 10%), you can wait appropriately or consider other investment channels.</li>
<li><strong>Pay Attention to Discount Opportunities:</strong> When a discount occurs, it is a good time to buy.</li>
<li><strong>Open an Account in Hong Kong:</strong> If conditions permit, you can consider opening an account in Hong Kong to directly purchase US stock QQQ, avoiding premium problems, and you can also allocate leveraged funds (QLD).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Comments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fully agrees with the doctor&rsquo;s analysis that the premium problem of A-share NASDAQ ETF is indeed caused by factors such as foreign exchange controls and market sentiment.</li>
<li>Suggests that investors who are more sensitive to premiums or want greater investment flexibility can consider opening an account in Hong Kong.</li>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> After Trump takes office again, will his domestic and foreign policies be very different from the past (including his first term), and will these changes shake the American system?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>American Strength:</strong> Clearly stated that the United States is very strong and Trump will make the United States stronger.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of Political Officials:</strong> American political officials are very good, they are loyal to the country, and can give up personal interests for national interests (for example, many political officials come from Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street investment banks, giving up high-paying positions).</li>
<li><strong>International Situation:</strong> Touched on international issues without commenting too much to avoid controversy.</li>
<li><strong>Ukraine Issue:</strong> Believes that the Ukraine issue was caused by Zelensky, who should be responsible for the current situation in Ukraine. Implies that Ukraine is being used by the United States.</li>
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> Overall optimistic about the United States and Trump&rsquo;s policies, believing that the United States will continue to remain strong.</li>

<li><strong>Awakening of Life:</strong> Emphasized the importance of awakening in life, realizing that you are not living for others but for yourself. Plan your life early and don&rsquo;t feel confused until retirement.</li>
<li><strong>Significance of Financial Freedom:</strong> Financial freedom is not only the accumulation of wealth, but also to obtain more time and freedom to pursue your life goals, to accompany your family, and to experience life.</li>

<li><strong>Definition of Capitalist:</strong> Redefined the concept of &ldquo;capitalist,&rdquo; pointing out that true capitalists are those who do not need to work themselves and can obtain wealth through capital operation.</li>

<li><strong>Rich People:</strong> Obtain a certain amount of wealth through investment (such as index funds).</li>
<li><strong>Wealthy People:</strong> In addition to investment, they also know how to use leverage (such as credit, wealth management mortgages) to accelerate wealth accumulation.</li>

<li><strong>Question:</strong> For investors in mainland China who cannot purchase leveraged funds (QLD), is it possible to keep investing in QQQ at regular intervals? Is this method feasible?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Completely Feasible:</strong> For investors in mainland China, since they cannot purchase leveraged funds, the following strategies can be adopted:
<ul>
<li><strong>Office Workers:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Retain six months of emergency reserve funds (cash).</li>
<li>Invest all remaining funds in A-share NASDAQ ETFs (such as 513100, 159941, etc.).</li>
<li>Hold for the long term and invest regularly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Retirees:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adopt an 80/20 asset allocation (80% invested in A-share NASDAQ ETFs, 20% invested in cash or short-term bonds).</li>
<li>Rebalance regularly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Strategies:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open an Account in Hong Kong:</strong> Suggests that after investing for a period of time (such as 3-5 years), if conditions permit, investors can consider opening an account in Hong Kong to directly purchase US stock QQQ and QLD and enjoy lower transaction fees and more flexible investment options.</li>
<li><strong>Gradual Transition:</strong> Gradually transfer A-share assets to a Hong Kong account to achieve a more optimized asset allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong></li>
<li>Keep it simple when you first start investing
*   If the child&rsquo;s account is not managed by him, you can invest in QLD</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Question:</strong> Worries about inflation and the Fed&rsquo;s policies. Recently, US CPI data has risen, and the market is worried that the Fed will postpone interest rate cuts or even raise interest rates, which will negatively affect the stock market?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationship between Interest Rates and the Stock Market:</strong>
<ul>

<ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investing in Humanity&rsquo;s Financial Reports:</strong> Instead of looking at individual company financial reports and short-term economic situations, focus on the development trend of the entire human race over thousands of years. Invest in indexes, looking at the performance of all of humanity.</li>
<li><strong>Investors Are Always Extremely Optimistic:</strong> Investment requires long-term optimism, believing that the market will eventually rise.</li>
<li><strong>Overcoming Human Nature, Looking at the Market with a Cold Eye:</strong> Investors must overcome human weaknesses and not be affected by short-term market fluctuations. Need to practice remaining calm in the face of a tiger, believing there is glass in front of you, believing there is a safety net, no matter how the market falls.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding the Demons and Monsters of Capitalism:</strong> Recognize financial scams, insurance traps, and the government&rsquo;s wrong policies under the capitalist system, and avoid being exploited. Capitalism is efficient, but has side effects, coupled with financial industry scams, deception, and government collusion or wrong policies.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth is a Talent, and It Can Come True:</strong> The capitalist system allows everyone to have the opportunity to get rich, but requires correct knowledge and strategies. The education system is cultivating slave labor, while the financial industry is exploiting human weaknesses to sell fear. You can listen to Li Lu&rsquo;s speech to understand the difference between investment and speculation.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Young People:</strong> Young people who are still working should directly invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ) and consider using leveraged funds to increase returns. Young people must increase returns, there is no other choice, try to buy leveraged funds.</li>
<li><strong>Retirees:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Insufficient Assets: Take other strategies.</li>
<li>Sufficient Assets: Choose different asset allocation strategies depending on whether there is stock pledging and whether there are other income sources.
<ul>
<li><strong>No Pledging, Need to Withdraw Money from Assets:</strong> 80/20 principle (80% index funds, 20% cash).</li>
<li><strong>With Pledging, No Need to Withdraw Money from Stock Assets:</strong> 442 principle (40% index funds, 40% leveraged funds, 20% cash).</li>
<li><strong>No Pledging, No Other Income:</strong> 433 principle. If there is no other income, and you need to withdraw money from assets, only 80/20. Have stock pledging, do not need to withdraw money from assets to use 442.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Emergency Fund:</strong> Use 00864B as an emergency fund to cope with unexpected situations.</li>
<li><strong>About Loans:</strong>
<ul>
<li>All loans must be able to be repaid from salary or stable cash flow.</li>
<li>Try to pay off loans before retirement.</li>
<li>If there is a mortgage that has not been paid off after retirement, part of the funds can be invested in high-dividend ETFs (such as 0056), and the dividends used to pay the mortgage interest, with the remaining funds used for investment. For example, borrow NT$10 million, with an interest rate of 2.78%, and no repayment is required for 20 years. The annual interest is NT$278,000, requiring NT$4.5 million to be placed in 0056, because 0056 has a 6% dividend yield, and the remaining NT$5.5 million is added to the 433 or 442 allocation. If there is also rental income, you can use 442.</li>

<li><strong>Term Life Insurance:</strong> If you are the family&rsquo;s primary income earner and have minor children, you can purchase term life insurance to protect the family&rsquo;s financial security in the event of an accident. Only buy term life insurance that is purchased once a year, which is cheaper. If your assets reach 20-30 million, you don&rsquo;t need to insure anymore.</li>
<li><strong>Funds from Redeeming Insurance:</strong> Invest in index funds to obtain higher returns.</li>

<li><strong>Not Recommended to Purchase Property:</strong> Houses are fixed assets, lack liquidity, and have high risks. Taichung Shin Kong Mitsukoshi will close down, and real estate will too. If you buy a house to live in for 60 years, and are forced to live in the same house for 60 years, that&rsquo;s strange.</li>

<li>Question 1: The family income is divided between husband and wife. Is the 433 or 442 asset allocation based on the husband or the family income?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: It depends on each family&rsquo;s situation. If it is centrally managed or centrally thought out, you can think in the thinking mode of the whole family, depending on whether you understand the financial situation of the whole family. If the husband is more conservative and mostly in cash, the wife can be more aggressive and buy leveraged funds to balance it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: My son is studying abroad, and the monthly expenses are NT$40,000. How should I include this in the expenses?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Treat this expense as a fixed deposit asset, deduct it directly from 00864B, and separate it from investment assets. This part will be spent this year and cannot be regarded as an investment asset. Transfer it directly to 00864B so that it will not be affected by market fluctuations for at least one year.</li>

<li>Question: Currently holding 00662 and 00670L, allocated in an 80/20 ratio, and not withdrawing money from stock assets, do I need to adjust to 442?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: If you need money, you can consider using credit, and then use the extra money you borrowed to allocate to 442. Borrow money, buy stocks with NT$1 million borrowed, and put NT$1 million in cash. Switching to 442 immediately will increase your return through two-tenths of the cash. Ask how much you can borrow. If the bank dares to lend, don&rsquo;t be afraid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: If gradually adjusting to 442, how to arrange the buying order?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Sell 00662 and convert to 00670L, as long as the total asset beta value is 1.2, the rate of return will remain unchanged. If you can take out a loan, take out the loan as soon as possible and adjust to 442 immediately. Hurry up and borrow, change it immediately.</li>

If your child plans to study in the United States in the future, then wait until you need it.

<p>This session revolves around investment and life wisdom. The core idea is to maintain a long-term perspective on investments, avoid being influenced by short-term market fluctuations, and continuously learn from life experiences to form one&rsquo;s own investment philosophy and life wisdom.  Just like life, investment also requires continuous learning and reflection.</p>

<ul>
<li>People nearing retirement can consider using a revolving line of credit home loan (HELOC), treating the credit line as a part of their cash reserves for living expenses without touching the principal investment, thereby increasing overall asset returns.  For example, if someone has $40 million in retirement funds and obtains a $10 million HELOC, the total assets become $50 million, and the annual disposable funds increase from $800,000 to $1 million.</li>
<li>The HELOC credit line can supplement the 20% cash portion of asset allocation.</li>
<li>Note: It&rsquo;s easier to obtain a HELOC before retirement; it becomes more difficult afterward. The loan term typically doesn&rsquo;t exceed age 90.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not recommended to take out a loan after retirement to repay the HELOC.</li>
<li>A listener shared a strategy of using a HELOC for living expenses, which James considers a good option.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing:  Shared her experience of investing most of her retirement funds in savings insurance a few years ago, resulting in much lower returns than expected. This year, she redeemed a portion of the funds and invested in QQQ, achieving better returns (13.68% in three months). However, with the current market reaching new highs, she&rsquo;s hesitant to invest further, finding it difficult to overcome the psychological barrier of &ldquo;buying with eyes closed.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: Courage comes from the subconscious and requires training.  Believe that the market will continue to rise and practice self-hypnosis to reinforce the &ldquo;buy when you have money&rdquo; concept. Used the example of QQQ potentially reaching $500,000 to illustrate that the current price is still very cheap.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: After following James&rsquo;s advice, she redeemed funds from savings insurance and invested in QQQ and QLD. However, due to insufficient trading frequency, she couldn&rsquo;t purchase QQQ 2D. Her current living expenses are primarily covered by alimony, and the cost of living in Taiwan is relatively low.</li>
<li>Question 1: Does she need to buy and sell repeatedly to meet the trading frequency requirement?

</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Can she buy fractional shares in Taiwan?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes, but it&rsquo;s recommended to buy whole shares first and use the remaining funds for fractional shares.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: How to calculate retirement fund needs?  Can she receive social security?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Calculate retirement fund needs based on annual expenses. Alimony can be considered income, but it&rsquo;s recommended to claim social security (even if her ex-husband objects) and adjust the asset allocation ratio accordingly, as alimony is not a permanent income source. She needs to be prepared.  Also recommended switching from SWVXX to BOXX.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: Discussed the psychological pressure of buying after a stock reaches new highs. Experienced investors feel more pressure due to having reference points, while newcomers are more receptive. Like buying discounted items in a supermarket, having the original price as a reference makes purchasing more appealing.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Shared his views on two newly issued ETFs by Invesco (QBI and QQLV) and compared them to QQQ. QBI selects larger market cap stocks from QQQ, while QQLV selects stocks with lower volatility.</li>
<li>Question: What are James&rsquo;s views on these two new ETFs?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Doesn&rsquo;t recommend investing in unfamiliar ETFs, even if they perform well.  Stick to investments within your circle of competence.

<ul>
<li><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Emotions are the biggest enemy in investing. You need to avoid being influenced by news and information, stay rational, and refrain from chasing rising or falling markets.</li>
<li>Investing requires a long-term perspective, aiming for a timeframe of 40 years or more. Warren Buffett acquired 99% of his wealth after the age of 50, demonstrating that patience is key to wealth creation.</li>
<li>Choose investment targets that are consistently stable and provide high returns. Index funds are the best option, especially QQQ, which boasts a long-term annualized return of 14%.</li>
<li>Adhere to the &ldquo;never sell&rdquo; strategy to allow assets to continue appreciating. Avoid selling stocks unless absolutely necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scam Avoidance Guide:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Be wary of various investment traps. Do not trust any projects that guarantee high returns, especially those that require you to sell existing assets for new investments.</li>
<li>Do not readily believe any investment or financial management information received via phone, text messages, or online platforms. Any information involving bank accounts or government departments must be verified through official channels.</li>
<li>Be cautious of aggressive sales tactics from financial institutions. Stick to your investment plan and avoid being lured by various fancy financial products.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Real Estate Investment:</strong>
<ul>
<li>James advises against homeownership for average working individuals, believing it turns them into &ldquo;mortgage slaves&rdquo; burdened with heavy loan pressure, hindering wealth accumulation.</li>
<li>He advocates for a &ldquo;rent instead of buy&rdquo; approach, suggesting using a stock pledge loan to rent high-quality housing at lower interest rates, then investing the saved funds for higher returns.</li>
<li>Consider purchasing real estate only when your assets reach a certain scale and you can comfortably afford the payment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New Trends in China&rsquo;s Economy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The People&rsquo;s Bank of China recently introduced a series of potent fiscal policies, including reserve requirement ratio and interest rate cuts, injecting funds into banks, and encouraging stock purchases, to stimulate economic growth.</li>
<li>These policies will contribute positively to stabilizing China&rsquo;s real estate market, boosting consumer confidence, and promoting global economic recovery.</li>
<li>Investors should pay attention to developments in the Chinese market and seize new investment opportunities.</li>

</h2>
<p><strong>IM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Through conversations with individuals of different age groups, IM discovered that most people have insufficient awareness of long-term savings and are often constrained by mortgages and other factors. By comparing the returns of index funds in different countries and regions with those of fixed deposits and pensions, IM illustrated the advantages of long-term investment in index funds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>INGYNYING:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: INGYNYING&rsquo;s mother wanted to sell all her assets to purchase a house but, after persuasion, realized that this would lead to losing opportunities for asset appreciation. Many of INGYNYING&rsquo;s friends are afraid of change, preferring to endure the hardships of their current situation rather than attempt new investment methods.</li>
<li>Question: How to convince family members to accept new investment concepts?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: Utilize data and case studies for illustration, such as comparing the long-term returns of fixed deposits and index funds, and sharing success stories of investors. It&rsquo;s also important to respect family members&rsquo; choices and refrain from forcing them to accept new ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Questions:  Should someone with assets worth 50 times their annual living expenses use their salary to pay for a car? How can a couple combine their stock accounts for collateral purposes?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: It is recommended to utilize Tesla&rsquo;s official website loan to purchase a vehicle, then use funds from a stock pledge loan to repay the car loan. Dedicate your salary entirely to investment. Couples can combine their accounts through a joint account for collateral, sharing the limit, while their accounts remain individually managed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Eric&rsquo;s mother is visiting the US and is concerned about medical expenses. How should this be  handled?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer:  Purchasing travel insurance is advised, but excessive worry is unnecessary. Most non-emergency situations can be treated back home. If encountering extremely high medical costs, attempting negotiation with the hospital or seeking alternative solutions is possible. Due to the specific circumstances of foreign nationality and lack of income, the hospital may choose not to pursue the medical expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dean:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Dean purchased a new car using Tesla&rsquo;s website loan and a stock pledge loan, conserving a significant amount of capital. Learning about investing boosted Dean&rsquo;s confidence to decline a high-paying job and choose to stay home with their child.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Questions: How to secure a loan from Tesla&rsquo;s official website for a car purchase? Can funds from 401k or IRA accounts be used for collateral? What are the options if QQQ is not available in their company&rsquo;s 401k plan?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: To apply for a car loan through Tesla&rsquo;s website, choose the desired model and configuration, click &ldquo;Order Now&rdquo;, and select &ldquo;Finance&rdquo;. Funds in retirement accounts cannot be used as collateral; it is recommended to transfer part of those funds to a brokerage account for collateral purposes.  Alternative options include choosing an S&amp;P 500 index fund or inquiring with the company about the possibility of Blockage Link to invest in QQQ.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EVA:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: As a single, middle-aged woman with limited savings, how to balance work and investment? Should selling the house be considered for investment purposes?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: Continue working diligently while consistently making monthly investments. Even small amounts will accumulate over 8-9 years, reaching the threshold for collateral, allowing you to leverage and accelerate wealth growth. Selling a house for investment is an option but requires careful consideration based on personal circumstances.  If renting is more cost-effective, choose to rent and allocate the funds to investments yielding higher returns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Questions:  Any knowledge regarding the latest Roth SEP IRA policy?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: The policy information is quite recent, and the accuracy of the $69,000 limit requires verification. Consulting with professionals like a financial advisor at Chase or Lisa is recommended. As it is a new product, not all institutions may offer it.</li>
<li>Sharing: Jenny shared a personal experience of being scammed, reminding everyone to exercise caution and avoid trusting any investment information, particularly those spread through unofficial channels.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Haoqing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Haoqing relayed the experiences of close friends falling victim to scams, lamenting that scam tactics are constantly evolving and are hard to guard against, even for highly educated individuals.</li>
<li>Question: How can investment concepts be better conveyed to people around us to prevent them from being deceived? Is there a need to explain professional investment knowledge?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: Avoid explaining intricate investment knowledge; simply emphasize the core principle of long-term investment in index funds. Excessive professional details may confuse them, making them more susceptible to being misled by other investment information and ultimately falling prey to scams.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Recounted an NFT scam incident encountered on Clubhouse, warning everyone to be wary of risks in the cryptocurrency world. Expressed gratitude toward James&rsquo; investment philosophy for helping them avoid such traps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Amy shared personal encounters with scams, including impersonations of government departments and courier companies. She emphasized the importance of relying only on written communication and ignoring any investment information delivered through phone calls or text messages. Amy suggested that, when in doubt, contact official channels for clarification.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Becky:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Suggestion: Avoid answering calls from unfamiliar numbers, set up spam filters, and use a less important email address when necessary to share personal information to minimize the risk of scams.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: What are your thoughts on China&rsquo;s most recent economic policies? Are they sustainable?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: The People&rsquo;s Bank of China has introduced powerful policies that are having a positive impact on economic confidence. Investors should keep an eye on these developments. Although the policies appear to be heading in a positive direction, their sustainability remains to be seen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Julia:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question:  Any updates on the Roth SEP IRA policy? Are there any financial institutions already offering related products?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: The policy information is fairly new, and the $69,000 limit&rsquo;s accuracy is debatable. Consulting with a professional is advised. Being a new product, not all institutions might offer it yet.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>“You have enough money when you have enough.&quot;
&ndash; Many people</p></blockquote>
<p>Many individuals believe that having just enough to get by is sufficient. This is a mistaken notion, as money is never truly enough. True financial freedom lies in possessing the power of choice – going wherever you want, doing whatever you desire – instead of being constrained by finances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Never borrow money for investments.&rdquo;
&ndash; Many people</p></blockquote>
<p>Many believe that borrowing for investment is unwise; however, this viewpoint is overly cautious. True investors, like Warren Buffett, skillfully leverage debt. Following the principle of &ldquo;borrow for consumption, invest for asset growth&rdquo;, the correct approach is to use borrowed money for expenses and personal money for investment. This enables rapid wealth accumulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All investment information received through phone calls, text messages, or online platforms is not trustworthy.”
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Nowadays, numerous scams operate through these channels. It&rsquo;s crucial to exercise caution and avoid blindly believing any financial advice or information. Anything involving bank accounts or government departments must be verified through official sources. Additionally, seeking guidance from qualified professionals is essential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Investment must be consistently stable over the long term, which is why index funds are the only viable option.&quot;
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Within the complex investment landscape, index funds stand out as a few reliable options capable of offering consistent stability and high returns. Index funds are like living organisms; they will never die, whereas all individual stocks will eventually disappear within a century.  If you&rsquo;re looking for generational wealth, index funds are the way to go.</p>

<li><strong>Wealth is accumulated slowly, and enjoying the process of wealth accumulation is the meaning of life.</strong> Getting rich overnight or quickly is not the best way. Slowly accumulating wealth and enjoying it allows you to experience the true meaning of life and learn and grow from it.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t blindly pursue high returns while ignoring risks.</strong> Many people pursue quick riches and hope for super high returns, but often overlook the risks involved, which may ultimately lead to losses outweighing gains. Learn to assess risk and choose an investment strategy that matches your risk tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>Investing requires finding a definite eternity, ignoring market noise, and maintaining inner peace.</strong> Index fund investing is a definite and eternal strategy that does not require painstaking research and operation. Simply holding for the long term can yield considerable returns.</li>
<li><strong>Investment is a loser&rsquo;s game, not seeking to win, but seeking not to lose.</strong>  In investing, avoiding mistakes is more important than pursuing victory. Index fund investing can help investors reduce mistakes and ultimately achieve victory.</li>
<li><strong>Buying in a lump sum at any time and holding for the long term is superior to other investment methods.</strong> Investing early and holding for the long term maximizes returns and delivers the best investment returns.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to distinguish between what can be done, what is effective, what can be worried about, and what is not worth worrying about.</strong> Focus your energy on important and solvable issues, ignore those that are irrelevant or beyond your control to improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t work too hard, let your money work for you.</strong> Put your money into the market and let it create wealth for you instead of devoting all your energy to work. Learn to utilize investment tools to achieve passive wealth growth.</li>
<li><strong>All pressure comes from expectations, and all worries come from not having a solution.</strong> Lower your expectations and actively seek solutions to relieve stress and anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to transfer pressure to those who can bear it and think about solutions for the worst-case scenario.</strong> Don&rsquo;t bear the pressure alone, learn to seek help, and think in advance about solutions to the worst-case scenario to calmly deal with challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain inner peace, focus on the important things, and ignore the insignificant things.</strong> Stick to simple things, don&rsquo;t get involved in complex things, to maintain inner peace and focus on what really matters in life.</li>
<li><strong>Account security is the primary issue in investing. Choose a large, reputable brokerage to open an account and avoid using online brokers.</strong> Online brokers have security risks, such as account theft and asset freezing. Choosing a large, reputable brokerage can better protect your account security.</li>

<p><strong>Dave:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
Shared the results of James&rsquo; TQQQ simulation backtest and raised the question of how to avoid the risk of a sharp TQQQ drawdown.</li>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
James believes that it is impossible to predict the market and avoid all risks completely. The important thing is to control risk exposure and avoid over-betting. If you are worried about the volatility of TQQQ, you can choose a more conservative investment strategy, such as QQQ. James also reminds everyone to distinguish between personal thinking and public advice, and not to be easily swayed by the thoughts of others.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
Shared his experience of investing in stocks through his company&rsquo;s savings association, as well as discussions about the MAGS fund and emergency funds.</li>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ol>
<li>About the MAGS fund: James believes that it is uncertain whether the MAGS fund can outperform QQQ in the long term. Investment should choose targets that have been tested by time, such as QQQ or SPY.</li>
<li>About emergency funds: James believes that emergency funds are a personal responsibility and government policies cannot be relied upon entirely. Everyone should prepare sufficient emergency funds according to their own circumstances to cope with contingencies.</li>

<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
Regarding the performance of 00670L, James explained the performance difference caused by USD hedging and how to solve it by investing in QLD through sub-brokerage. He emphasized that Beta and ROI are different concepts. Beta represents volatility, not ROI. The investment model in Taiwan needs to be adjusted according to specific circumstances, such as  maintenance margin requirements and exchange rate fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>JJU:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
Shared his insights on market unpredictability and the importance of mentors and friends. He believes that investing, in addition to selecting good targets, is more about maintaining inner peace and enhancing one&rsquo;s spiritual level.</li>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ol>
<li>About the difference between reinvest and buy share: James explained the difference between reinvesting and buying shares. The former automatically invests dividends or capital gains into the investment target, while the latter uses new funds to buy shares.</li>
<li>About the fund ratio of Roth IRA and Individual Brokerage Account: It is recommended to maximize the Roth IRA limit if possible.</li>
<li>About real estate mortgage investment: It is recommended to sell the property if possible to reduce the risk of investing in real estate. Otherwise, consider a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) for investment, but pay attention to risk control and ensure that you can repay the loan on time. HELOC is a revolving credit line, similar to a credit card, which can be withdrawn and repaid at any time.</li>
</ol>

</ul>
<p><strong>Draft down:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
Proposed the possibility of leveraging 0% interest credit cards for investment and using the box spread strategy to increase capital utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ol>
<li>About credit card investment: James believes that credit card limits are limited and there is a risk of not being able to renew the loan, making it unsuitable as a main source of investment funds. It is only suitable for short-term turnover of small amounts of funds.</li>
<li>About the box spread strategy: James believes that the box spread strategy is too complex and risky and is not recommended for ordinary investors.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ol>
<li>How to overcome short-term pain in the investment process: James suggested lowering expectations, not pursuing perfection or getting rich quickly, finding solutions to problems, and transferring the pressure to those who can bear it, such as superiors or more experienced individuals. Think about solutions for the worst-case scenario, such as job loss or investment losses, and maintain a positive mindset, believing that the problem will eventually be solved.</li>
<li>About non-US tax resident investing in US stocks: James believes that non-US tax residents can use their passports to open brokerage accounts in the US without a Social Security Number. It is recommended to choose large, reputable brokers, such as Charles Schwab, and avoid using online brokers, such as Webull and Robinhood, as online brokers have security risks and imperfect regulations.</li>
