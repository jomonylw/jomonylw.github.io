<p>The core theme of this session is <strong>the flexibility of asset allocation and the survival rule for long-term investment</strong>. Teacher James emphasizes that asset allocation is not about rigid, unchanging numbers but should be dynamically adjusted based on an individual&rsquo;s cash needs, capital size, and risk tolerance. The central idea is that investors should first determine their cash holding ratio, which will dictate the risk exposure (Beta value) range of their portfolio and their sustainable annual withdrawal rate. For long-term investors, the most important goal is to &ldquo;survive,&rdquo; ensuring they can endure the long-term fluctuations of the market, rather than blindly pursuing the highest rate of return.</p>

<p>Teacher James focused on explaining two pages from the handout on asset allocation, emphasizing their flexibility and core principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Cash Ratio Determines Everything</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your asset allocation should first be determined by your <strong>cash ratio</strong>, which will set the Beta value range of your portfolio and the percentage of your annual withdrawable amount.</li>
<li><strong>Basic Principle</strong>: The position in leveraged funds should not be higher than your cash position, nor should it be higher than your position in the underlying ETF (QQQ). For example, a 433 allocation (40% QQQ, 30% leveraged, 30% cash) is considered quite aggressive.</li>
<li><strong>Examples of Allocations and Withdrawal Rates for Different Cash Ratios</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>30% Cash</strong>: Beta range between 0.7 and 1.0.
<ul>
<li>With a Beta of 1.0 (e.g., 433 allocation), the maximum annual withdrawal is <strong>2%</strong>.</li>
<li>With a Beta of 0.7 (e.g., 703 allocation), the annual withdrawal can be <strong>3%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>40% Cash</strong>: Beta range between 0.6 and 0.9.
<ul>
<li>With a Beta of 0.9 (e.g., 334 allocation), the annual withdrawal can be <strong>3%</strong>.</li>
<li>With a Beta of 0.6 (e.g., 604 allocation), the annual withdrawal can be <strong>4%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>50% Cash</strong>: Beta range between 0.5 and 0.7.
<ul>
<li>With a Beta of 0.5-0.6 (e.g., 505 or 415 allocation), the annual withdrawal can be <strong>5%</strong>.</li>
<li>With a Beta of 0.7, the withdrawal rate should be reduced to <strong>4%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic Management of the &ldquo;15-Year&rdquo; Cash Reserve</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ideal State</strong>: Hold enough cash to cover 15 years of living expenses to safely navigate any market downturn and consolidation period, while waiting for the investment portion to double.</li>
<li><strong>Practical Application</strong>: If you don&rsquo;t have a 15-year cash reserve initially (e.g., only 10 years), you should adopt the following strategy:
<ul>
<li><strong>When the market rises</strong>: Convert profits from investments (especially leveraged funds) into cash to gradually build your cash reserve up to the 15-year level. Once the 15-year mark is reached, there&rsquo;s no need to add more.</li>
<li><strong>When the market falls</strong>: <strong>Absolutely do not</strong> invest your only 10 years (or less) of cash into the market. You cannot predict how long a bear market will last, and exhausting your cash too early will force you to sell stocks at a market low, leading to investment failure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Core Philosophy</strong>: The most important thing in long-term investing is <strong>to survive</strong>, not the rate of return. A slightly lower rate of return is acceptable; over a long period, your wealth will still be substantial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>Recognize the Nature of Financial Practitioners</strong>: There is a conflict of interest between bank wealth managers, insurance agents, and their clients. Their goal is to sell products, not to maximize the client&rsquo;s interests. Investors need to strengthen their own financial literacy and use the bank&rsquo;s services (like loans) rather than buying the financial products they push.</li>
<li><strong>Advice for the Elderly</strong>: Older friends (e.g., 70-80 years old) should spend more money to enjoy life rather than making asset growth their primary goal. With allocations like 505, 415, or even 316, the annual withdrawal rate can be increased to 5-6%.</li>
<li><strong>Be Greedy When Others Are Fearful</strong>: Looking back at the market bottom in October 2022 (QQQ around $260, lowest at $254), there was extreme panic in the market, but it proved to be an excellent buying point. Investors need to train themselves to remain greedy when others are fearful.</li>
<li><strong>Ignite a Capitalist Awakening</strong>: Teacher James believes that the essence of capitalism is the exploitation of labor and emerging nations by capitalists and developed countries through the system. We must learn their &ldquo;strong ships and powerful cannons&rdquo; of financial operations to change the destiny of ourselves, our families, and even our nation.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: My son is a senior in college and invests NT$1,500 monthly into 00670L (a 2x leveraged QQQ ETF). He just started two months ago. I&rsquo;m wondering if he needs to rebalance now, given the small amount, or at what amount should he start?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: With a small initial amount, just keep investing. When the market value of 00670L accumulates to about NT$1 million, he can start asset allocation, for instance, by shifting to a 433 (40% underlying, 30% leveraged, 30% cash) portfolio. As his salary increases, he can continue to invest and perform a smart rebalancing once a year at year-end. Additionally, the teacher encouraged young people, noting that they live in an era of rapid technological development where investment returns are higher than in the past. As long as they know how to invest, their future will be brighter.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Speaking for the first time, 30 years old, working in the Southern Taiwan Science Park. He shared his journey from investing in individual stocks, to the 0050 ETF, to discovering leveraged ETFs and adopting the teacher&rsquo;s 433 allocation. He fully agrees with the teacher&rsquo;s entire system (asset allocation, smart rebalancing, stock pledge) and aims to retire at 40 with NT$30 million. He quoted the ancient text <em>Discourses on Salt and Iron</em>: &ldquo;Wealth lies in strategy, not in physical labor; profit lies in market conditions, not in diligent farming,&rdquo; to affirm the importance of financial knowledge. He sees the teacher as his &ldquo;rich dad&rdquo; and is very grateful.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: He shared that he might be fated to be single (&ldquo;孤寡命&rdquo;) but still wants his parents to retire early. He was also curious and asked the teacher how he chose his spouse when he was young.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Encouragement to Speak</strong>: He encouraged everyone to practice public speaking, as logic and expression are powerful tools for changing the world.</li>
<li><strong>About Destiny</strong>: An astrological chart tells you your life&rsquo;s lessons and risks to be aware of, not a fixed outcome. A &ldquo;fate of solitude&rdquo; is a reminder to overcome this issue by making more friends and building good relationships, not by resigning to it.</li>
<li><strong>About Love</strong>: The core is to <strong>&ldquo;become someone worthy of being loved.&rdquo;</strong> Don&rsquo;t set conditions for your partner; improve yourself first to become that person. True love is unconditional giving (&ldquo;I do&rdquo;). Learn to listen to your partner and don&rsquo;t keep score. If you first become a person worthy of love, your partner will naturally love you.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He discussed Trump&rsquo;s proposed $100,000 application fee for H1B visas. He believes this reflects that America now needs the &ldquo;elite of the elite,&rdquo; as many basic jobs will be replaced by AI. However, he thinks that even if one cannot come to the US to work, it&rsquo;s fine. We can invest in QQQ/00662 and become the &ldquo;bosses&rdquo; of these American geniuses, which might be a better choice.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: First, he corrected the understanding of the policy, explaining that the $100,000 fee is mainly for direct overseas hires whom the company doesn&rsquo;t know, not for graduates who studied in the US. This actually benefits international students in the US. More importantly, he stressed the importance of philosophical thinking: before judging an opinion, first stand in the other person&rsquo;s shoes to understand why they say it, instead of immediately refuting it. Finally, he humorously taught him how to express love to his wife, starting with silently chanting it to himself as a form of self-hypnosis.</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Sharing</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Regarding the H1B news, he noticed that the Chinese-American community initially shared it frantically without understanding the facts. The subsequent clarification from the White House stated the policy mainly targets outsourcing companies. This validates the teacher&rsquo;s point that &ldquo;market information is garbage, ignore it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Learning financial literacy requires patience. <strong>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry.&rdquo;</strong> He observed that the pace of life in the US is slow and encouraged everyone to learn slowly, one step at a time.</li>
<li>Borrowing is a great tool, but it requires accumulated financial wisdom. When your capital is large enough, banks will chase after you to lend you money. At that point, you won&rsquo;t haggle over a 2.1% versus 2.5% interest rate, because your investment return will far exceed it.</li>
<li>He offered a brilliant analogy: <strong>&ldquo;Strive to become the &rsquo;eternal QQQ&rsquo; in your partner&rsquo;s words,&rdquo;</strong> someone they will hold for the long term and never sell.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Strongly agreed. &ldquo;Surviving is the most important thing, don&rsquo;t be in a hurry.&rdquo; He warned those who have suffered heavy losses in short-term trading or futures not to expect to quickly recover their losses using our method, as this is very dangerous. For those nearing retirement, he also advised against borrowing money to invest due to the high dual risks of repayment pressure and market volatility.</li>

<li>I&rsquo;m interested in Zi Wei Dou Shu (Chinese astrology). What do the stars &ldquo;Di Kong&rdquo; and &ldquo;Di Jie&rdquo; in the self-palace represent? And is &ldquo;synastry&rdquo; (comparing charts) for couples useful for determining fate?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Allocate the money after it arrives.</strong> Don&rsquo;t act in advance, as anything can happen in the process. There&rsquo;s no need to predict.</li>
<li><strong>About Astrological Charts</strong>: Don&rsquo;t worry too much about minor stars like Di Kong and Di Jie. The most critical thing to look at is which palace the &ldquo;Huà Jì&rdquo; (Transforming Envy/Doom) star is in. Huà Jì represents your life&rsquo;s lesson and weakness, something you need to work hard to overcome, not your destiny. For example, if Huà Jì is in the marriage palace, it&rsquo;s a reminder to put effort into managing your marital relationship. Looking at your partner&rsquo;s chart is not for &ldquo;synastry&rdquo; but to understand their weaknesses and challenges, thereby fostering more empathy.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He recalled a discussion with the teacher about Intel three years ago and now believes that Intel is being propped up by state power, and its fundamentals have not improved. He observed that high-end chip design (3nm) is becoming concentrated in Silicon Valley.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: He asked for the teacher&rsquo;s prediction on the final outcome of TikTok being acquired by a US consortium.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: This deal must involve some kind of under-the-table agreement between Trump and Xi Jinping. It is a political issue, not a business one. The US will ultimately gain control over the algorithm. He also reminded everyone to be wary of scam videos using AI to fake celebrity appearances.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: When promoting the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy, if friends or family follow the advice to invest but then sell out of fear during a market downturn and blame us, how should we handle this situation?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Start with a disclaimer</strong>: Clearly state that you are not a professional advisor and they are responsible for their own risks.</li>
<li><strong>For friends and family</strong>: You must first ask yourself if you are willing to &ldquo;go to hell&rdquo; for them. That is, are you psychologically prepared for the possibility of the relationship breaking down? If you are, then do it; if not, don&rsquo;t give advice.</li>
<li><strong>A feasible method</strong>: You can suggest they start with a small amount of money they can afford to lose and explain the long-term nature of it. You could even verbally promise that if they still have a loss after ten years, you&rsquo;ll cover it.</li>
<li><strong>For those you can&rsquo;t communicate with</strong>: Just block them. Make them &ldquo;unheard, unseen, and non-existent&rdquo; in your world. Our energy is limited; we should help those who are worth helping.</li>

<p>This session began with a very specific and core technical investment question—&ldquo;how to flexibly manage asset allocation&rdquo;—for which Teacher James provided a clear framework based on the cash ratio, emphasizing the paramount principle of &ldquo;survival before growth&rdquo; in long-term investing. The subsequent Q&amp;A session was extremely rich, extending from a young person&rsquo;s first investment to marriage, parenting, life philosophy, destiny, and insights into macroeconomic and political issues. This fully demonstrated that the learning atmosphere of the CLEC community has transcended mere investment management, entering a higher level where investment philosophy is integrated into all aspects of life. The members&rsquo; sharing was sincere and profound, showcasing a positive, supportive, and mutually growing community.</p>

<p>The core of this class is to establish a simple yet firm long-term investment philosophy. Teacher James emphasizes that investors should ignore market noise and short-term fluctuations, adhering to a strategy of &ldquo;buy, hold, and never sell.&rdquo; Successful investing requires not only the right asset allocation (especially using cash to build an &ldquo;anti-fragile&rdquo; portfolio) but also a strong psychological constitution, including steadfastness, patience, and faith, to ultimately achieve financial freedom and inner peace.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore Market Noise</strong>: Teacher James points out that in his 40 years of investing, almost all financial and political news and market analysis have been &ldquo;demons and monsters,&rdquo; useless for long-term investing. He quotes a student&rsquo;s message, emphasizing that social opinions and market volatility are irrelevant to long-term investors; enjoying the tranquility of the present is far more important than focusing on fleeting issues.</li>
<li><strong>The Best Strategy: Buy, Hold, Don&rsquo;t Sell</strong>: This is the core principle throughout. The art of investing lies not in complex market timing or stock picking, but in persistently holding high-quality assets for a lifetime, or even for generations.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Should Be Easy and Simple</strong>: The teacher uses an analogy: investing should only take 5-10 minutes a year and should not be a burden on one&rsquo;s life. If you make investing complicated, it&rsquo;s like adding a lot of chili oil to a simple clear noodle soup, which ruins the original flavor. Investors should spend more time enjoying life and being with their families.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Spicy Beef Noodle&rdquo; Theory</strong>: When asked about asset allocation ratios, the teacher uses a vivid example. He believes that asking someone else how to allocate your assets is like asking them how much chili to add to your beef noodles because everyone&rsquo;s risk tolerance (how much spice they can handle) is different.
<ul>
<li><strong>Advice for Beginners</strong>: For novices or those unsure of their risk tolerance, the teacher suggests starting with &ldquo;clear-broth beef noodles&rdquo; (a conservative allocation), for example, 50% of assets in the market and 50% in cash.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy for Large Sums of Capital</strong>: It is recommended to divide it into three parts: buy 1/3 immediately, buy 1/3 in batches, and keep 1/3 as cash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Three Elements of Investment Psychology: Steadfastness, Patience, Faith</strong>: Once you have bought in, the next step is to cultivate a strong psychological mindset.
<ul>
<li><strong>Steadfastness</strong>: Not being affected by market fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Patience</strong>: Enduring painful periods of market decline is a necessary psychological quality.</li>
<li><strong>Faith</strong>: Believing in the long-term upward trend of the market is the path to reaching the highest realm of investing.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash and Market Volatility are &ldquo;Boosters&rdquo; for Assets</strong>: The teacher uses the concept of a &ldquo;boost converter&rdquo; in electronic circuits as an analogy. Market volatility is like an &ldquo;oscillator,&rdquo; and cash is like the &ldquo;electric current.&rdquo; Investing cash during a market downturn (oscillation) can effectively push asset values to new highs.</li>
<li><strong>Fragile vs. Anti-fragile</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Fragile Investment</strong>: For example, investing 100% in QQQ. If the market goes to zero, your assets go to zero. This is like a flower in a greenhouse that cannot withstand a storm.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-fragile Investment</strong>: For example, holding an index fund while keeping 30% in cash. Even if the market goes to zero, you still have 30% of your assets. This is like wildflowers everywhere, tenacious and able to survive and even thrive in harsh environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>An Anti-fragile Life</strong>: This concept applies not only to investing but also to life. For example, an employee who serves only one company is fragile and can be laid off at any time; whereas an Uber driver is anti-fragile, earning income as long as they drive. In the AI era, a pure software engineer becomes fragile, while experts in various industries who know how to use AI become anti-fragile.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mathematical Explanation of Volatility Decay</strong>: The teacher reveals the characteristic of volatility decay in leveraged ETFs through calculation.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Assume QQQ falls for 45 consecutive days (-1% each day) and then rises for 46 consecutive days (+1% each day), it will eventually hit a new high.</li>
<li><strong>Comparison</strong>: Under the same conditions, if TQQQ falls for 45 consecutive days (-3% each day) and then rises for 46 consecutive days (+3% each day), its final price will still be below the initial starting point, unable to recover its losses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Who is Not Suitable for Leveraged Funds</strong>: Investors who are afraid of downturns and cannot withstand huge volatility should stay away from leveraged funds.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Use of Leveraged Funds</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Position Size Cannot Be Too Large</strong>: Investing a large sum of money into a high proportion of leveraged funds at once is very dangerous. In a long bear market, it could lead to assets going to zero with no chance of recovery.</li>
<li><strong>Suitable for Dollar-Cost Averaging</strong>: For investors with a continuous cash flow (like a monthly salary), making small, regular investments over decades is feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Warning</strong>: For retirees, a high leverage position could send you back to the workforce; for those currently employed, it could postpone your retirement plans indefinitely.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Live in the Present, Eliminate Worry</strong>: The teacher guides everyone to ponder a question: &ldquo;If tomorrow were the end of your life, could you depart with a smile?&rdquo; He believes that true happiness comes from &ldquo;dying without regrets.&rdquo; If you have regrets in life, you should remedy them now, not spend your days worrying.</li>
<li><strong>Happiness is a Human Right</strong>: Investing should be joyful. If it causes you pain, don&rsquo;t participate. The value of life is not in its length, but in its depth and brightness.</li>

<li>Sharing:
<ol>
<li>A new member from last week, he is very grateful to Teacher James for his quick email response, which solved his problem with the app&rsquo;s operation.</li>
<li>He combines his insights from reading with the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy to create daily reminders for his investment principles: have capital, an investment philosophy, discipline, patience, and luck, combined with the teacher&rsquo;s &ldquo;hear, know, understand, believe, execute, firmly believe.&rdquo;</li>
<li>He quotes a conversation between Warren Buffett and Bill Gates to emphasize the principle of &ldquo;getting rich slowly,&rdquo; believing that patience is the most difficult but most crucial part of investing.</li>
<li>He shares his past principles for selling individual stocks (the reason for buying disappears, the target price is reached, the company faces irreversible difficulties), but now he has found a better option (QQQ) and is liquidating his individual stocks.</li>
<li>Regarding real estate, he believes that a house is also a financial product and proposes a view: &ldquo;Houses aren&rsquo;t bought by people, they&rsquo;re bought by money,&rdquo; with its price driven by market liquidity. He thinks the reason real estate returns are sometimes very high is due to high leverage (e.g., 5x or even 10x). His family owns a jewelry store, and he suggests that high-net-worth individuals can allocate a small amount to gold as a hedge against extreme risks.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Question: The &ldquo;Nine Scenarios&rdquo; PDF file he downloaded shows overlapping text and numbers on his phone. He asks if he can get the link again.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is likely a display issue with his personal phone, as there is no problem with the link itself. He suggests trying to open it on a computer or asking family or friends for help.</li>

<li>Sharing: He found that in the Chinese market, the management fee for the Harvest Nasdaq ETF (159501) is 0.2% lower than the 513100 recommended by the teacher, believing it will make a difference in long-term returns.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: The market is very efficient; this small fee difference is unlikely to bring extra profit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: How to change his parents&rsquo; investment mindset? He details the painful experience of his father suffering severe losses due to high-risk investments and being deceived by relatives. This has led his parents to be extremely risk-averse, preferring to deposit tens of millions of RMB in a bank for a fixed term (with an annual interest rate of only about 1.5%) and refusing to touch any funds. They even believe that real estate is the most secure asset. He feels confused and doesn&rsquo;t know if he should continue to persuade them.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t try to change them. Everyone&rsquo;s &ldquo;psychology of money&rdquo; is shaped by their life experiences. His parents&rsquo; views are &ldquo;correct&rdquo; in their world, a way to protect themselves from further harm. What you should do is manage your own money, invest your own funds, and become a big tree yourself. When you become very wealthy, your parents might see it, but changing them is not your responsibility. The most important thing is to let them live a peaceful and happy life.</li>

<li>She believes investors should first have an attitude of self-responsibility instead of just seeking answers from the teacher. She spent over a year studying the teacher&rsquo;s courses very seriously, treating investing like a startup project, so her mindset is very stable.</li>
<li>She suggests new students (like Zhang Le) need to give themselves and their investment strategy some time, using three or four years of results to prove it to their parents, rather than trying to convince their family as soon as they start.</li>
<li>She has observed that the teacher is constantly changing and growing, giving different advice based on different students&rsquo; situations, such as once advising Taiwanese investors who needed stable cash flow to allocate a portion to high-dividend ETFs.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: He is in a good mood; his low tone of voice is because he is very calm inside, which is a very good state. He will not be influenced by the outside world and uses a joke about &ldquo;not wrestling with a pig&rdquo; to illustrate that for people who cannot understand, there is no need to argue, just say &ldquo;you are right.&rdquo; He emphasizes that he is growing and changing every day; otherwise, he would be stagnant.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Pursue inner peace (&ldquo;Where my heart is at peace, that is my home&rdquo;). When a person sees through many things and their heart is not troubled by any person or event, they will reach a very peaceful state. This requires nurturing one&rsquo;s spirituality, learning to &ldquo;separate&rdquo; from certain things, and taking back control of one&rsquo;s life, daring to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to things you don&rsquo;t want.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: These questions have been explained in detail in his previous videos and Excel sheets. The interest will automatically roll into the principal and does not need to be repaid manually. The interest rate depends on the asset size of the pledged account and the total assets of the entire household account. He advises Niu Fang to watch the series of videos specifically explaining stock pledges (especially episodes 004, 005), as it&rsquo;s difficult to fully understand just through Q&amp;A.</li>

<li>Keeping an extra 10% in cash is of course safer.</li>
<li>The remaining money can continue to be invested according to the 4-3-3 ratio.</li>
<li>Borrow as needed. For example, borrow only when you need to pay a bill this week; don&rsquo;t borrow in advance and let it sit.</li>

<li>Having followed the teacher for nearly 6 years, financial freedom has given him time for philanthropy, such as teaching indigenous communities. He noticed an interesting phenomenon: people are afraid of their health indexes (like blood sugar) going up, but they hope their wealth index (QQQ) goes up every day.</li>
<li>He mentioned hearing Howard Marks quote Warren Buffett on the &ldquo;Macro Insights&rdquo; program and then add: &ldquo;You never bet against the United States, and you never bet against China.&rdquo; He wanted to hear the teacher&rsquo;s opinion.</li>
<li>He observed the tech talent war between the US and China. Regardless of where the talent flows, it ultimately converges in the tech giants, which is a long-term positive for QQQ.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: What Howard Marks means is that the first choice for investment is still the US, but you shouldn&rsquo;t be bearish on China either, because its potential is huge. Therefore, you can choose not to be &ldquo;long&rdquo; China, but you should never &ldquo;short&rdquo; China. The focus of investment should remain on the United States.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>All information is a demon or a monster; in 40 years, no information has ever been useful.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view emphasizes the importance of ignoring short-term market noise and sticking to a long-term investment strategy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asking me how to do your asset allocation is like asking me how much chili to add to your beef noodles.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view vividly illustrates the personalized nature of asset allocation. Everyone&rsquo;s risk tolerance is different, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What our asset allocation needs to achieve is a state of &ldquo;anti-fragility.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view introduces the core concept of &ldquo;anti-fragility,&rdquo; which is to build an investment portfolio that can survive and retain strength even in extreme risk scenarios (like the market going to zero).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to raise a child than to maintain a house.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view reflects on the phenomenon in modern society where people sacrifice their quality of life, and even the desire to have children, for the sake of real estate, emphasizing the importance of life&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He who can buy is a grandson, he who can sell is a father, but he who never sells is a god.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view uses a colloquial analogy to highly praise the ultimate state of investing: &ldquo;hold for the long term, never sell.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Houses aren&rsquo;t bought by people, they&rsquo;re bought by money.
&ndash; Bruce</p></blockquote>
<p>This view points out the essence of the real estate market, whose price fluctuations are primarily driven by monetary liquidity rather than just the housing needs of the population.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t even manage the little bit of money in your hands, then don&rsquo;t go selling your house, and don&rsquo;t go taking out loans.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view advises investors to proceed step by step, starting with small amounts of capital and proving their ability to manage investments well before considering the use of larger-scale funds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investing can cultivate the mind.
&ndash; Jimmy</p></blockquote>
<p>This view highlights another dimension of investing: through the process of managing wealth and dealing with market fluctuations, investors can cultivate their character and achieve inner peace.</p>

<p>This session lucidly explains Teacher James&rsquo;s core investment philosophy and life wisdom. Starting from the simple principle of &ldquo;buy, hold, don&rsquo;t sell,&rdquo; it extends to the sophisticated strategy of using cash to build an &ldquo;anti-fragile&rdquo; portfolio, and then to a profound analysis of the risks of leveraged ETFs, providing investors with a clear guide to action. More importantly, the class transcends purely financial discussion, closely linking investment with personal psychological growth, family happiness, and inner peace. Through vivid analogies and real student cases, the teacher guides everyone to realize that true financial freedom is not just about numerical growth, but about breaking free from fear and anxiety, gaining the ability to control one&rsquo;s life and enjoy the present moment. At the same time, the teacher also reminds students that investment philosophy is constantly evolving and growing, requiring continuous learning and follow-up, otherwise, one becomes like a &ldquo;lost lamb,&rdquo; disconnected from the latest understanding.</p>
