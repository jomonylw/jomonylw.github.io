By simulating stock pledging strategies under different market conditions in Taiwan and the US, the session explores the impact of different withdrawal rates (1.5% vs. 2.7%) on asset growth. The course emphasizes that while pledging can amplify long-term assets, it comes with higher risks and requires strict spending control. During the Q&amp;amp;A, students shared their journeys from anxiety to peace of mind, once again proving the power of long-term investing.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<lite-youtube videoid="L90H95KxHCc" playlabel="L90H95KxHCc" params=""></lite-youtube>

<p>The core of this session is the introduction of a new portfolio backtesting simulation App, used to deeply analyze and compare the differences between <strong>stock pledging</strong> and <strong>non-pledging</strong> retirement withdrawal strategies. Through live demonstrations, Teacher James shows the maximum safe withdrawal rates (approx. 1.5%-1.8%) and risks of pledging strategies under different markets (Taiwan vs. US), interest rates, and LTV (Loan-to-Value) ratios. The core takeaway is: while pledging can significantly increase total terminal assets over the long term, it demands extremely high cash flow stability and very conservative withdrawal rates. Conversely, non-pledging strategies allow for a higher withdrawal rate (approx. 2.7%) but sacrifice asset growth for greater flexibility.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore Market Noise</strong>: Teacher James began by emphasizing that daily market fluctuations, international tensions, central bank rate changes, economic data, and financial reports are irrelevant to our long-term investment strategy. Investors should focus on holding for the long term and moving forward.</li>
<li><strong>The Logic Behind Choosing QQQ</strong>: We invest in indices like QQQ not by &ldquo;looking in the rearview mirror&rdquo; at past performance, but based on a belief in the future—<strong>belief in human growth, technological progress, and the development of the United States.</strong> QQQ is the purest representation of these three beliefs.</li>

<p>Developed by community member Martin, this App simulates long-term returns and risks under various asset allocations, pledging conditions, and withdrawal strategies.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Taiwan Scenario (40% QQQ, 30% QLD, 30% Cash)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parameters</strong>: Initial principal of 1 million, 3% interest rate, 60% LTV.</li>
<li><strong>Withdrawal Testing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Annual withdrawal of 1.5% (15,000): Results show assets survive safely from 2000 to 2025.</li>
<li>Annual withdrawal of 1.6% (16,000): Results show the portfolio is liquidated (fails) in 2009.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Under Taiwan&rsquo;s pledging conditions, the upper limit for a safe withdrawal rate is very strict at <strong>1.5%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>US Scenario (40% QQQ, 30% QLD, 30% Cash)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parameters</strong>: 6.5% interest rate, higher LTV (70% for QQQ, 95% for Cash, but QLD cannot be pledged).</li>
<li><strong>Withdrawal Testing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Annual withdrawal of 1.8%: Safely survives.</li>
<li>Annual withdrawal of 1.9%: Results in failure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Due to more relaxed LTV conditions in the US, the safe withdrawal rate can reach <strong>1.8%</strong>, showing slightly higher risk tolerance than in Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Interest Rates</strong>: When Teacher James lowered the US interest rate to 5% (the setting used in early Excel simulations), the safe withdrawal rate rose to <strong>2.1%</strong>, proving that interest rates are a critical variable in pledging safety.</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-Pledging Strategy (80% QQQ, 20% Cash)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximum Withdrawal Rate</strong>: <strong>2.7%</strong> of assets annually.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome</strong>: While it safely survives 25 years, by 2025, the total asset value has barely grown, returning to its 2000 initial level. This strategy sacrifices capital appreciation for higher immediate cash flow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Comparison at Equal Withdrawal Rates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assume both strategies withdraw only 1.5% (15,000) annually.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Pledger</strong>: Assets grow to 1.61 million by 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Pledger (Taiwan Plan)</strong>: Assets grow to 4.75 million by 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Given the same low expenses, the pledging strategy can result in several times more asset growth. Investors must weigh &ldquo;higher asset growth&rdquo; against &ldquo;higher current cash flow.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pledging Risks are High</strong>: A 1.5% withdrawal rate means your total assets must be 66 times your annual expenses, a high bar for most people.</li>
<li><strong>Combine with High-Dividend ETFs</strong>: Retirees might consider allocating a small portion (e.g., 10%-20%) to high-dividend products (like QYI) to generate stable cash flow, reducing the amount and pressure of pledged loans.</li>
<li><strong>For Those Still Working</strong>: You can experiment with pledging while continuing monthly contributions, which makes the outlook much more optimistic.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He pointed out that from 1999 to 2006, there was no real trading data for QLD. Different simulated extrapolation methods used by various platforms lead to differences in backtesting results. This may explain the discrepancies between models.

<li><strong>Question</strong>: When doing a Roth Conversion after retirement, if one does not use stock pledging, how should taxes be paid?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: There are two ways. One is paying with cash from your Brokerage Account, which is the best way as it maximizes the funds moved into the Roth. The second is having the broker withhold taxes during the conversion (e.g., convert 200k, withhold 20k for tax), but this reduces the principal entering the Roth.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Q1</strong>: In worst-case simulations (like the year 2000), cash positions and debt get very close. Is this safe enough?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: Yes, the simulation result is a &ldquo;narrow escape.&rdquo; In an extreme market crash of 85%, the assets just barely avoid liquidation. This illustrates why the withdrawal rate cannot be higher—2% is the tipping point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q2</strong>: When markets crash and cash is tight, should one be more cautious with &ldquo;Smart Rebalancing,&rdquo; such as reducing or pausing cash injections?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: Excellent question. We are indeed exploring more conservative approaches. One principle: if your cash reserve is lower than 15 (or even 20) years of living expenses, you should not touch it for rebalancing. An alternative is to sell some QQQ to buy QLD for rebalancing instead of using cash, preserving your safety net.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q3</strong>: When should company-issued semiconductor stocks be sold? Given tax issues, is it worth waiting or using complex Exchange Funds?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: As long as you have held them for over a year, a fixed long-term capital gains tax applies, which is independent of your personal income. Don&rsquo;t wait; sell after one year to diversify risk early. Avoid complex financial products like Exchange Funds—simple is best.</li>

<p>This session, through a practical backtesting App, turned the abstract concept of stock pledging into something concrete. Teacher James not only demonstrated the tool but, more importantly, revealed the trade-offs between risk and reward in different strategies. Pledging can significantly amplify wealth but requires extreme discipline; non-pledging is more flexible and suits those with higher cash flow needs. Most movingly, the real stories of students—especially Wu Li Yun from a grassroots background and Min&rsquo;s hardworking girlfriend—vividly illustrated the core philosophy: &ldquo;Investing can change your destiny.&rdquo; This was not just a technical analysis class, but a deep exchange about hope, peace, and life awakening, reaffirming the community&rsquo;s belief in long-term holding and simple investing.</p>

<p>The core message of this lecture is that <strong>&ldquo;The Key to Successful Investing is Inaction.&rdquo;</strong> Teacher James emphasizes that investors should minimize decision-making and ignore all market noise, such as economic data, international situations, and interest rate hikes or cuts, as these are irrelevant to long-term investing. The correct approach is to do nothing after buying quality assets. However, the prerequisite for &ldquo;inaction&rdquo; is a deep understanding of market risks. One must prepare for the worst-case scenario (e.g., an 85% asset decline lasting for ten years). Only through rigorous asset allocation and maintaining sufficient cash flow can one ensure survival in this prolonged test.</p>

<li><strong>Scam Alert</strong>: The teacher once again called out a scam account (ID changed to <code>James.James.1</code>), reminding everyone that he would never engage in any form of proxy trading, charge fees, or ask for money transfers. Anyone doing so in his name is a scammer.</li>
<li><strong>Munger Wisdom Video Recommendation</strong>: The teacher highly recommended a video (1 hour and 23 minutes) about Charlie Munger&rsquo;s life wisdom. The video focuses more on interpersonal, family, and marital relationships and life philosophy rather than just investing, and the teacher found its content to be very accurate and profound.</li>
<li><strong>Encouraging Content Creation</strong>: The teacher shared the example of a student, &ldquo;Wen Yan,&rdquo; who used an AI tool (notebooklm) to turn a two-hour lecture video into a ten-minute short, which achieved excellent reach on Xiaohongshu and Bilibili.

<li><strong>The Fewer Decisions, the Better</strong>: In investing, the most successful strategy is to &ldquo;make no decisions.&rdquo; When the market panics and everyone is discussing various macroeconomic issues, the best response is to ignore them.</li>
<li><strong>The Core of Investing</strong>: The most important and difficult thing in investing is to &ldquo;stay put&rdquo; after buying, which requires immense discipline. Any attempt to operate, change, or predict the market is almost destined to lower final investment performance.</li>
<li><strong>Practicing &ldquo;Inaction&rdquo;</strong>: The core skill to practice in investing is &ldquo;inaction.&rdquo; Your feelings are worthless in the face of the market, even &ldquo;garbage.&rdquo; You must be emotionless to invest successfully.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Duality of the Market</strong>: In the long run, the market will inevitably hit new highs (there is no highest, only higher), which is a natural consequence of human societal development. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean the market won&rsquo;t fall.</li>
<li><strong>The Inevitability of Extreme Risk</strong>: In an investor&rsquo;s lifetime, they will inevitably encounter an extreme situation where the market drops 85% from its peak, and this downturn could last as long as ten years.</li>
<li><strong>Qualification for Investing</strong>: You are only truly qualified to invest when you can face an 85% drop in your assets without a rebound for ten years, still adhere to the principle of &ldquo;never sell,&rdquo; and live a normal life. If you cannot accept the decline, you should not invest.</li>
<li><strong>The Only Antidote to Risk</strong>: The only way to combat this extreme risk is <strong>asset allocation</strong>. You must assume the worst-case scenario will happen tomorrow and allocate your assets accordingly, ensuring you have enough cash (e.g., enough to live on for ten years) to get through the crisis.</li>

<li><strong>Designed Laborers</strong>: Teacher James pointed out that the entire capitalist society educates the public to be diligent laborers, not capitalists.

<li><strong>The Trap of Traditional Financial Advice</strong>: Following the traditional path of &ldquo;work hard, save in the bank, buy insurance&rdquo; will ultimately lead to poverty. Savings are eroded by inflation, and money earned through labor and time can never achieve true financial freedom.</li>
<li><strong>A Shift in Mindset</strong>: The purpose of this channel is not just to teach how to get rich, but to awaken a &ldquo;capitalist consciousness.&rdquo; Once you establish a capitalist mindset, even without great wealth at present, you are already on the path to riches and can achieve inner liberation and happiness.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He has recently been studying Charlie Munger&rsquo;s wisdom in depth and advises everyone to listen to the views of wise people rather than getting caught up in whether the market is at a high point. He believes that in a bull market, investors should examine their own capabilities and risk control to avoid excessive borrowing.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Charlie Munger repeatedly warns against using leverage and borrowing money to invest. This seems to differ from the channel&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;pledging assets for a loan to invest.&rdquo; How does the teacher view this difference?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: What Munger opposes is the kind of leverage that could cause you to <strong>lose your freedom or go bankrupt</strong>. For example, a property developer who bets everything and goes bankrupt due to soaring interest rates, or an ordinary person who takes out a loan for a luxury house beyond their means to save face, ending up trapped by the loan and losing the freedom to quit their job. Munger&rsquo;s core idea is &ldquo;don&rsquo;t lose your freedom because of debt.&rdquo; The borrowing we advocate is based on extremely strict risk control: you must be able to assume that the stock market could drop to zero and stay there for 15 years, and you would still be fine. Only then can you borrow that money. This requires investors to have adequate asset allocation and cash flow and is not suitable for those nearing retirement. Therefore, the core spirit of both views is consistent: emphasizing survival and freedom in the worst-case scenario.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He mentioned that a legislator in Taiwan is recently promoting an investment plan for infants aged 0-10, where the government and parents would each contribute 4,000 TWD/month into an ETF.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This direction is correct, but requiring parents to contribute places a huge burden on young families, which is a flaw. He suggested a better way would be for all listed companies to increase their capital by 1% annually, inject these shares into a &ldquo;Taiwan ETF pool,&rdquo; and then distribute them to newborns. This way, neither the government nor the parents have to pay; the capitalists invest in the country&rsquo;s future, which would face less resistance.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: He believes the current AI development is just the beginning of a great era, far from being a bubble. He is willing to endure short-term fluctuations of 20-30% in exchange for potentially 10x returns in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: He shared his transformation from an &ldquo;employee mindset&rdquo; to a &ldquo;capitalist mindset.&rdquo; In the past, society taught us to pursue high income, then buy a nice car and a nice house, but this is actually a trap that keeps you working for capitalists. He shared how he once sold a luxury car and invested the 2 million TWD into an index fund, a decision that became one of the best of his life.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: There&rsquo;s recent discussion in Taiwan about calculating the supplementary health insurance premium based on total annual dividend income. How does this affect investors in high-dividend ETFs like 0056? What are the teacher&rsquo;s suggestions?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: First, he criticized the unfairness of this tax system, as it specifically targets vulnerable groups who rely on dividends, while capital gains are not taxed. He believes all income should be taxed fairly. Second, he proposed a solution: where there&rsquo;s a policy, there&rsquo;s a countermeasure. If dividend taxes or premiums become too high, investors can consider investing in US-listed high-dividend ETFs, such as <strong>JEPQ</strong> or <strong>QQQI</strong>, through a &ldquo;sub-brokerage&rdquo; service. The income from these would be considered overseas income, which has a high tax exemption threshold in Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>Follow-up Discussion</strong>: A student pointed out that dividends from products like JEPQ purchased through a sub-brokerage might be subject to a 30% withholding tax, and some brokers (like Cathay) do not assist with tax refunds. Therefore, the teacher emphasized that before undertaking such an operation, one <strong>must</strong> confirm the tax policies with their broker. If the tax is withheld and cannot be refunded, it is not a suitable investment.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: He has seen families turn against each other over inheritance. He is puzzled why wealth can harm families and asked for the teacher&rsquo;s perspective on the phenomenon where the first generation strives, the second is harmonious, but by the third, disagreements and conflicts arise in wealth succession.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Property disputes usually happen when the heirs are in dire need of money. For them, any slight injustice is magnified. The most troublesome assets are illiquid ones like real estate. For elders who wish to distribute their assets according to their will, they must plan ahead while alive through <strong>trusts</strong> or <strong>gifts</strong>. Once a person passes away, everything can only be distributed according to the law. As children, the best approach is to follow legal procedures to avoid disputes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: He observed that even business owners work like laborers, constantly working and expanding. Others who are financially free dare not stop, feeling useless without work. Is this the result of capitalist indoctrination?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: As long as a person needs to go to work every day, even if it&rsquo;s their own company, they are still a &ldquo;laborer,&rdquo; and they even bear the risk of their own capital, which is a double risk. A true capitalist has no responsibilities and lets money work for them. This &ldquo;workaholic&rdquo; mindset is shaped by decades of education and work environment and is indeed hard to change. Munger also reminds us not to neglect family for the sake of making money, or you might win wealth but lose at life.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He shared the story of his 78-year-old American landlord. The landlord placed all 13 properties he built into a family trust, managed jointly by his descendants, to maintain family cohesion and wealth. He compared this model to the teacher&rsquo;s preferred QQQ model and marveled at how wise his decision was to sell his property and switch to QQQ, which has freed him from excitement or fear over market fluctuations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The landlord&rsquo;s approach was one of &ldquo;necessity.&rdquo; Holding a large amount of real estate presents problems like difficulty in division and high inheritance taxes. Setting up a trust for descendants to manage essentially turns them into &ldquo;laborers,&rdquo; bound by these properties for generations. If he had held QQQ, wealth succession would be much simpler, easily done through annual gifts, and his descendants wouldn&rsquo;t have to toil to manage the assets, allowing them to truly enjoy the freedom that wealth brings.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To succeed in investing, the fewer decisions you make, the better. Making no decision is the best decision.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: At the beginning, the teacher explained his core investment philosophy, emphasizing that in an environment of information overload and market volatility, maintaining &ldquo;inaction&rdquo; is the best path to success.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You must assume that the market will start falling tomorrow, that it will fall by 85%, and that it will last for 10 years. Only if you can still make your investments and asset allocations under this assumption&hellip; are you qualified to invest.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: When discussing risk control, the teacher proposed an extremely harsh psychological and financial test. Only investors who can pass this &ldquo;stress test&rdquo; are truly prepared.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Your feelings are garbage as far as the market is concerned. So in the market, don&rsquo;t talk about feelings. You should have no feelings to be able to invest.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The teacher sharply pointed out that investing is a rational domain, and any judgment based on personal feelings or emotions is worthless, or even has negative value, in the face of Mr. Market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In a capitalist society, everyone is educated to become a diligent laborer. The banks and the government essentially want to empty your pockets so you can work hard for the country.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The teacher offered a profound critique of the current socioeconomic system, arguing that it encourages people to become laborers who are then systematically &ldquo;harvested.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What Munger is talking about with borrowing is that you will lose your freedom&hellip; You must not lose your freedom because of borrowing, this is very important.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: In explaining Munger&rsquo;s opposition to leverage, the teacher grasped its core message—the biggest risk of leverage is not financial loss, but the potential loss of personal freedom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Saving is a very bad thing. So if you put your money in the bank, it gets thinner and thinner with inflation. How can you possibly become rich? It&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The teacher challenged conventional wisdom, pointing out that in an era of inflation, keeping money in a bank is tantamount to asset depreciation and is a major obstacle to wealth creation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As long as you need to get up and go to work every day, even if it&rsquo;s your own company, you are a laborer.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: When answering a student&rsquo;s question about whether a boss is a capitalist, the teacher gave a clear definition: a true capitalist makes money work for them, not the other way around.</p>

<p>This lecture, starting from the core investment philosophy of &ldquo;inaction,&rdquo; builds a complete system of investment thought. Teacher James not only emphasized the importance of long-term holding and ignoring noise but also spent a significant amount of time analyzing the most critical and often overlooked aspect of investing—risk awareness. He demanded that every investor confront the market&rsquo;s cruelest possibilities and build their investment portfolio based on that benchmark. In the Q&amp;A session, through in-depth interaction with students, the lecture&rsquo;s content was greatly enriched and deepened. Whether it was the interpretation of Munger&rsquo;s &ldquo;no borrowing&rdquo; wisdom, or discussions on wealth succession and tax planning, the session was full of practical guidance and thought-provoking philosophy. Ultimately, the lecture returned to a fundamental question: we invest and manage our finances to achieve true freedom, not to be enslaved by wealth.</p>

<p>This session delves into multiple dimensions of investment and wealth. The core ideas revolve around three &ldquo;Seven Levels&rdquo; theories:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Seven Levels of Investment Learning</strong>: The journey from initial exposure to forming an unwavering belief.</li>
<li><strong>The Seven Levels of Wealth Accumulation</strong>: The path from understanding investment to maximizing wealth through concentration, leverage, tax savings, and longevity.</li>
<li><strong>The Seven Levels of Investment Operations</strong>: From the confusion of short-term trading to finally embracing the wealthy class strategy of &ldquo;invest only in indexes, never sell, and live off pledged assets.&rdquo;
The course emphasizes that true wealth stems from correct cognition and discipline, and points out that in the AI era, we should use technology to liberate ourselves and return to the essence of life, rather than becoming busier.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore Short-Term Volatility</strong>: The market has been highly volatile recently due to events like US-China tariffs and a potential US government shutdown, but investors should ignore this market noise and avoid making incorrect moves. Typically, any action based on short-term predictions is wrong.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Technical Analysis</strong>: The accuracy of technical analysis is about the same as a coin toss, roughly 50/50, and should not be the primary basis for investment decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Responsibility in Investing</strong>: Investment sharing is for experience exchange only and does not constitute advice. Everyone&rsquo;s financial situation is different; final decisions require personal learning and execution, for which individuals are responsible.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>AI Makes the Impossible Possible, But Also Makes People Busier</strong>: Technological advancements like AI have made things previously unimaginable (such as quickly creating multilingual videos) possible. However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean people become more idle; on the contrary, they become busier because there are more things they can do.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage Using AI to Spread Correct Investment Philosophies</strong>: Students can use AI tools like NotebookLM or ChatGPT to translate investment philosophies into articles or videos in different languages, helping to &ldquo;inform&rdquo; more people of their right to be wealthy.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Philosophy is Evolving DNA</strong>: Our investment philosophy is constantly evolving and being optimized. For example, it was once emphasized that those who pledge assets &ldquo;must&rdquo; allocate to leveraged funds to maintain returns. The current view, however, is that for the sake of stability, one can pledge assets without holding leveraged funds. Students need to keep up with their learning to avoid sticking to outdated knowledge, as the investment world is like biological evolution—ceasing to evolve risks being eliminated.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Seven Levels of Investment Learning</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hearing</strong>: Just encountering the information, possibly thinking it&rsquo;s a scam.</li>
<li><strong>Knowing</strong>: Beginning to realize there&rsquo;s substance to it.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding</strong>: Developing cognition after in-depth research.</li>
<li><strong>Believing</strong>: Transitioning from cognition to trust.</li>
<li><strong>Executing</strong>: Putting belief into action, the key being &ldquo;buy when you have money, immediately, at market price.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Enduring</strong>: Being able to withstand the pain and hold on when the market drops by 40% or even more.</li>
<li><strong>Faith</strong>: Reaching a state of inner peace where market fluctuations don&rsquo;t matter. This is usually built on proper asset allocation and sufficient cash flow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Seven Levels of Wealth (Differences in Magnitude)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knowing How to Invest vs. Not Knowing</strong>: This is the first dividing line, separating 90% of the world&rsquo;s population.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Correctly vs. Incorrectly</strong>: Among those who know how to invest, choosing the most efficient assets (e.g., QQQ vs. VOO/VT) can result in a hundredfold difference in assets over the long term.</li>
<li><strong>Han Xin Deploying Troops (Concentrating Capital)</strong>: Concentrating funds in the highest-return assets instead of diversifying into inefficient products like insurance, annuities, and bonds can create another hundredfold gap in assets.</li>
<li><strong>Pledging and Borrowing</strong>: Learning to use stock pledging to obtain liquidity instead of selling assets widens the asset gap again.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing Without Repaying</strong>: Understanding that a pledge loan is an expansion of assets, not a traditional debt that needs to be repaid. Compared to those who rush to repay, the potential for wealth growth is entirely different.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Tax Savings</strong>: Through legal tax planning (like Roth Conversions in the US), one can save enormous amounts in taxes, further widening the wealth gap.</li>
<li><strong>Longevity</strong>: When all the above are done correctly, the longer you live, the more significant the compounding effect, and the more assets you accumulate. Longevity is the key determinant of ultimate wealth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Seven Levels of Investment Operations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level One</strong>: New to the market, occasionally making money on individual stocks, thinking investing is easy.</li>
<li><strong>Level Two</strong>: Trying derivatives like options, possibly profiting in the short term, but likely losing money in the long run.</li>
<li><strong>Level Three</strong>: Starting to study financial reports and industry trends, trying to buy low and sell high, but the more you know, the more you lose.</li>
<li><strong>Level Four</strong>: Obsessed with technical analysis and futures, engaging in frantic short-term trading, thinking you&rsquo;re a stock market guru, but actually being closest to bankruptcy.</li>
<li><strong>Level Five</strong>: Understanding that investing is about sharing in a company&rsquo;s growth and knowing how to pick good companies, but still suffering from the huge volatility of individual stocks. You work like a dog for mediocre returns.</li>
<li><strong>Level Six</strong>: Grasping the power of long-term holding and starting to make big profits, but still needing to constantly research and switch companies. Having cash on hand after selling becomes a new source of anxiety. It&rsquo;s still a busy operational life.</li>
<li><strong>Level Seven (The Ultimate)</strong>: Investing only in index funds (QQQ). Buy whenever you have money, never sell, buy with your eyes closed. Implement proper asset allocation (e.g., 433), keep enough cash, and fear no market crash. Live off loans from stock pledging and never repay them, allowing assets to continuously generate wealth. This is the true wealthy class.</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Astonishing Power of Compounding</strong>: Using the example of investing NT$10,000 per month, at an 18% annualized return, it can grow to NT$547 million in 40 years. This shows that becoming wealthy is achievable for ordinary people; it is a &ldquo;God-given&rdquo; right. The key is whether one is informed and takes action.</li>
<li><strong>The Nature of Work and the Meaning of Life</strong>: Our lives should not be solely for work and survival. Viewing one&rsquo;s job as the entirety of life is a form of enslavement by capitalism. Only after being free from work pressure can one truly understand what &ldquo;life&rdquo; is and pursue what one loves, like gardening or enjoying a pastoral life.</li>
<li><strong>The Risks of Leveraged ETFs</strong>: One must deeply understand the nature of leveraged ETFs (like TQQQ). They can bring tenfold returns in the short term but can also drop to zero (a 99.999% decline) in a single major crash. Therefore, their risk must be managed through asset allocation and rebalancing; never go all-in.</li>

<li>Share: She recently heard a story that Tony Robbins suggests two things for success: first, imitate someone you want to become; second, practice positive meditation daily. She applied this to herself by imitating James, practicing the seven levels of investing step-by-step—from understanding investing and doing it right to pledging assets without repayment—and believes she is on the right path. She also mentioned that Taiwan&rsquo;s inheritance tax is very low.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He agrees that Taiwan&rsquo;s inheritance tax is low (maximum 20%), so there&rsquo;s no need for complex trusts or planning. The best &ldquo;tax avoidance&rdquo; is to &ldquo;have many children and grandchildren&rdquo; and use the annual gift tax exemption to transfer wealth to future generations early, which has an amazing compounding effect. He shared a cautionary tale of a bank deceiving a family into taking out a massive loan to &ldquo;plan&rdquo; for inheritance tax, warning that bank promotions can sometimes be scams.</li>

<li>Share: He has opened Custodial Accounts for his three young children, with a portfolio of 60% QQQ, 20% QLD, and 20% SGOV. He plans to invest small amounts regularly. His goal is not to give them a certain amount of money but to &ldquo;teach them how to fish,&rdquo; allowing them to see the account grow from a young age and giving him the opportunity to teach them the complete financial system in the future, including Pledge Loans. This is both a transfer of wealth and wisdom.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He strongly agrees with this educational approach. He pointed out that gifting early is the best estate planning. For example, giving a daughter $20,000 annually for 40 years could grow to nearly $100 billion at an 18% return, completely tax-free, which is far more significant than worrying about the inheritance tax exemption amount.</li>

<li><strong>Han Xin Deploying Troops</strong>: Following James&rsquo;s advice, he canceled unnecessary investment-linked insurance policies, sold an idle property in Taiwan to invest in US index funds, and did not rush to pay off his mortgage. These three decisions significantly improved his financial situation.</li>
<li><strong>Evolution of Investment Philosophy</strong>: He recalled that he initially only learned to &ldquo;Buy and Hold SPY,&rdquo; which was just 1/5 of the entire system. Now, the system has evolved to include a complete solution with QQQ, Pledge Loans, a 2% withdrawal rate, and 433 asset allocation, which makes him feel more secure and at ease.

<li>Question: Regarding the Traditional IRA, some suggest holding cash in it so the future tax base is low. But she thought if she put it all in QQQ, although the future tax would be higher, the growth would also be much higher than cash. Isn&rsquo;t that better?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a balance between risk and taxes. James provided a strategy: suppose you convert $100,000 to a Roth account annually. You could buy $100,000 of TQQQ (3x leverage) in the Roth. To balance the risk of the entire portfolio, you could hold $200,000 in cash in your Traditional IRA. This way, your high-growth component (TQQQ) is in the tax-free Roth account, while the cash in the Traditional IRA hedges the risk. This optimizes the tax structure without reducing the overall return potential.</li>

<li>Share: She shared an experience helping a novice investor friend. The friend initially claimed she could tolerate a 50% fluctuation, but when told the loss could last for 3-5 years, she immediately said she couldn&rsquo;t accept it; her bottom line was not losing principal for more than 1-2 years. Through this conversation, Ling deeply realized that everyone&rsquo;s definition of and tolerance for &ldquo;risk&rdquo; is completely different. Before taking any investment action (like buying immediately at market price), the first task is to thoroughly understand what level of risk you can truly bear.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He highly praised Ling&rsquo;s clear logic. He emphasized that knowing your own risk tolerance is the first step in investing, more important than any strategy. He used the 2000 dot-com bubble as an example, where QQQ took 15 years to return to its high, which is why he recommends keeping enough cash for 15-20 years. <strong>&ldquo;Survival is more important than making money.&rdquo;</strong> Before you understand yourself, you should keep more cash; the rate of return is not the top priority.</li>

<li>Question: He raised a macro question about the global &ldquo;de-dollarization&rdquo; trend and central banks hoarding gold. He wanted to know if this poses a long-term threat to an investment strategy centered on US dollar assets and whether we need to prepare for it.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He acknowledged that this trend is real. However, he offered several counterpoints: 1. The US debt problem could be resolved by productivity gains from AI (e.g., an extra 1.5% GDP growth annually). 2. A thought experiment: If the US government announced a &ldquo;ban on using US dollars for gold transactions,&rdquo; the entire dollar-denominated gold market would collapse instantly, and the value of gold hoarded by countries would plummet. The US has many tools left in its toolbox to maintain its hegemony. The disputes between the US and China over chips and rare earths are games between nations and do not affect our long-term confidence in US technological development, which is unrelated to investing in QQQ.</li>

<li>Question: As a new student from Beijing, he asked which QQQ product he should buy. Should he buy the US-listed QQQ directly, the Hong Kong-listed 3086/9086, or the A-share listed 513100? Also, he wants to dollar-cost average for his daughter; is a leveraged ETF (TQQQ) suitable?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He recommended buying a Hong Kong-issued product (like 3086), primarily to avoid US inheritance tax. Hong Kong also has a 2x leveraged Nasdaq fund (like CSOP NASDAQ-100 INDEX DAILY (2X) LEVERAGED PRODUCT - 7261) and money market funds that can be used for asset allocation. For his daughter&rsquo;s money, he can buy 513100 in China or a Stock Connect product in Hong Kong. Additionally, James mentioned that a Simplified Chinese version of his &ldquo;Bible of Financial Management&rdquo; is available and he can ask for it.</li>

<li>Share: She shared her experience using AI (ChatGPT) to research the tax issues of Health Savings Accounts (HSA) in California. She found that AI would &ldquo;confidently spout nonsense,&rdquo; with different AIs and online articles providing contradictory information, creating a phenomenon of &ldquo;mutual contamination.&rdquo; In the end, she had to return to first principles and personally check the original tax code to confirm the correct information: in California, both HSA contributions and investment gains are subject to state tax, significantly reducing the tax benefits.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He completely agreed. He emphasized that current AI is still an &ldquo;amateur&rdquo; tool or &ldquo;toy&rdquo; and cannot be used for serious professional fields like tax or law. He himself found that AI makes basic numerical errors when creating videos. He reiterated that he does not recommend using HSAs and added a clarification that he might have previously confused HSAs with 529 plans. The beneficiary for withdrawals from a 529 account is a designated beneficiary (like a child), whereas the HSA holder can use the funds themselves.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is a natural gift&hellip; you have the right to be wealthy, and you need to be informed of this.
&ndash; James
Background: James explained his original intention for starting the channel was that many people don&rsquo;t know they are inherently entitled to become wealthy through correct investing.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The more advanced technology and AI become&hellip; people who use AI don&rsquo;t become more idle but busier, because there are more and more things you can do.
&ndash; James
Background: When discussing the impact of AI, James pointed out that AI is a tool that expands the boundaries of our capabilities, resulting in us being able to do, and wanting to do, more things, rather than making us idle.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A person doesn&rsquo;t know what it is to be human until they are without a job. That is what you call a &rsquo;life.'
&ndash; James
Background: In explaining his life philosophy, James criticized the idea of &ldquo;living to work,&rdquo; believing that only by breaking free from the shackles of work can one truly experience and understand the meaning of life.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Survival is more important than making money.
&ndash; James
Background: When commenting on Ling&rsquo;s case study about risk perception, James emphasized that survival is the first principle of investing. Managing risk and keeping sufficient cash is far more important than chasing short-term high returns.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s understanding of risk can be completely different&hellip; You must first figure out what you consider to be risk before you allocate your assets.
&ndash; Ling
Background: Ling shared her experience helping a novice investor friend and discovered a huge gap between the friend&rsquo;s stated risk tolerance and her actual psychological bottom line, leading to this conclusion.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AI will confidently spout nonsense&hellip; In the world today, there is some information&hellip; that is prone to this kind of mutual contamination.
&ndash; Julia
Background: Julia shared her pitfalls when using AI to research complex tax issues, finding that AI and incorrect online information form a vicious cycle, mutually citing and amplifying errors.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Invest only in index funds, buy whenever you have money and never sell, buy with your eyes closed&hellip; Do your asset allocation&hellip; live off loans from stock pledging, and never repay them.
&ndash; James
Background: When summarizing the seventh and highest level of investment operations, James used this phrase to encapsulate the essence of the strategy for achieving ultimate financial freedom.</p></blockquote>

<p>This session was a systematic and in-depth review of investment philosophy and life-wealth concepts. Through a clear, three-tiered &ldquo;seven-level ladder&rdquo; model, James constructed a complete growth blueprint for listeners, from investment novice to wealthy magnate. The course not only taught &ldquo;what to do&rdquo; (invest in indexes, don&rsquo;t sell, use pledging wisely) but also profoundly explained &ldquo;why to do it&rdquo; (understand risk, ignore noise, believe in compounding) and the ultimate goal (achieve freedom in life, not be enslaved by work). The students&rsquo; sharing and questions—from practical operations to macroeconomics and the critical use of AI tools—greatly enriched the breadth and depth of the discussion, once again confirming that investment success ultimately stems from continuous learning, deep self-awareness, and a firm philosophical belief.</p>

<p>The core theme of this session is the <strong>evolution of investors</strong>. Teacher James compares investors to biological organisms, proposing that they need to evolve from &ldquo;single-celled lower animals,&rdquo; easily eliminated by market fluctuations, into &ldquo;higher animals&rdquo; capable of withstanding any market environment. This evolution is achieved by learning the correct investment philosophy and risk management. The key to this transformation is a firm belief that the market will rise in the long term, adopting a &ldquo;buy, hold, never sell&rdquo; strategy, and establishing an asset allocation that can withstand extreme risks (such as a market drop of 80% lasting for 10 years).</p>

<li><strong>Belief is Paramount</strong>: The market has no peak; it only goes higher. It won&rsquo;t hit a ceiling; it will only rise ceaselessly. Investors should ignore external analysis and short-term market turmoil because no analysis can beat the power of &ldquo;holding shares and doing nothing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>The Ultimate Strategy</strong>: The simplest strategy is the most effective—buy, hold, and never sell. As long as you do this, you will become wealthy.</li>
<li><strong>Future Outlook</strong>: QQQ is now near 600, will soon reach 1000, and in the future, we will see 6,000, and even 60,000. Human progress is limitless, and the market&rsquo;s growth has no ceiling.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extinction of Lower Animals</strong>: The vast majority of investors in the market are &ldquo;single-celled&rdquo; or &ldquo;lower animals.&rdquo; They have not been tempered by the harsh market environment and lack the ability to cope with extreme risks. Therefore, in every financial crisis (such as the 1996 Asian Financial Crisis, the 2000 Dot-com Bubble, and the 2008 Subprime Mortgage Crisis), these &ldquo;species&rdquo; are wiped out in batches.</li>
<li><strong>Survival Principles of Higher Animals</strong>: Becoming a &ldquo;higher animal&rdquo; means possessing an investment system that has been tested over the long term and is capable of evolving. The core lies in truly understanding risk and building an asset allocation that can withstand the worst-case scenario (a market drop of 80% lasting for 10 years).</li>
<li><strong>CLEC&rsquo;s Positioning</strong>: The philosophy and system of our channel are a &ldquo;higher animal&rdquo; system, tested and evolved over 40 years in the market. We directly elevate our students to the highest level of investing, allowing them to avoid the fate of &ldquo;slaughter&rdquo; and &ldquo;extinction&rdquo; at the bottom of the market. We are not engaging in a brutal &ldquo;Normandy Landing&rdquo; battle; instead, we are &ldquo;taking the elevator&rdquo; directly to the Mount Everest of wealth.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) vs. Reverse Mortgage</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>HELOC</strong>: Suitable for young people with stable jobs. It poses a risk for retirees without a steady income, as the bank may require principal and interest payments after a few years. If the market is down at that time, it will create immense cash flow pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Mortgage</strong>: More suitable for older individuals without a stable salary. It converts real estate into a steady monthly cash flow, significantly enhancing the security of retirement life. This money can be used for living expenses or reinvested, making it an effective way to activate property assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advantages and Red Lines of Securities-Based Lending (Pledging Stocks)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage</strong>: The process is convenient and can be done with a few clicks, without needing the bank&rsquo;s approval.</li>
<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: Strict risk control and asset allocation are mandatory. The amount you can borrow is linked to your cash ratio:
<ul>
<li><strong>30% Cash</strong>: Can use <strong>2%-3%</strong> of assets annually.</li>
<li><strong>40% Cash</strong>: Can use <strong>3%-4%</strong> of assets annually.</li>
<li><strong>50% Cash</strong>: Can use <strong>4%-5%</strong> of assets annually.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Serious Warning (for U.S. Investors)</strong>: In the United States, it is <strong>absolutely forbidden</strong> to reinvest money borrowed from a securities-based loan back into a securities account. This is a serious violation. If discovered, the lending privileges may be revoked, and immediate repayment may be demanded, leading to a financial catastrophe. Regulations in Taiwan permit reinvestment, but it is strictly prohibited in the U.S.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Principles for Using Credit Loans</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Short-term credit loans should be repaid with a stable salary to ensure healthy cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of the &ldquo;High Dividends Covering Loan Interest&rdquo; Trap</strong>: Many experts advocate taking out loans to buy high-dividend products. While the dividend yield (e.g., 7%) may seem higher than the loan interest rate (e.g., 3%), they ignore that repayment requires both &ldquo;principal and interest.&rdquo; The dividend alone cannot cover the monthly payment, which can easily lead to a cash flow crisis.</li>
<li><strong>Example of Flexible Use</strong>: For instance, if you need $100,000 to buy a car, you could apply for a credit loan of $800,000. Use $100,000 for the car payment and invest the remaining $700,000. Later, you can use a securities-based loan from your investment portfolio, borrowing 2% annually to help repay the car loan, thus achieving more efficient use of your assets.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Divide Between the Rich and the Poor</strong>: A key factor distinguishing the two is whether they have been taught the correct concepts of financial management. Wealth is a &ldquo;natural gift&rdquo; that everyone can possess.</li>
<li><strong>The Essence of Investing</strong>: Investing is not a field where more diligent research leads to better performance. The key is having the right direction and a deep understanding, after which it becomes &ldquo;autopilot.&rdquo; 99.99% of external information is not worth listening to.</li>
<li><strong>The Prerequisite for Wealth</strong>: You must invest your assets in high-return targets. This is why we choose QQQ, not SPY or VT, because the latter&rsquo;s returns will make you relatively &ldquo;poorer.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>CLEC&rsquo;s Mission</strong>: If the government wants to narrow the wealth gap, it should instill the correct financial management concepts in the public. This is precisely what CLEC is doing. We are committed to financial investment education as our social mission.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: I found at today&rsquo;s seminar that the biggest problem for most people is that they &ldquo;can&rsquo;t hold on.&rdquo; This might be due to being stuck by certain &ldquo;limiting beliefs.&rdquo; I suggest that when you are still a &ldquo;seedling,&rdquo; you should not discuss our philosophy with outsiders who don&rsquo;t understand it. They will only tell you to &ldquo;take profits&rdquo; or &ldquo;stop loss.&rdquo; Regardless of whether the market goes up or down, the external environment is not conducive to long-term holding. If you have questions, you should come back and ask the teacher or the &ldquo;higher animals&rdquo; in the community.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Absolutely correct. We are the &ldquo;higher animals&rdquo; of investing. Isn&rsquo;t it ridiculous for a higher animal to ask a lower animal for a prescription? It&rsquo;s like a Rolls-Royce owner asking a financial advisor who rides a motorcycle or takes the bus for financial advice. Your circle determines your cognition. If you have questions, you must come back and ask those who have already made big money in this market.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: I am very excited that my family (son, daughter-in-law) and I have all joined the CLEC family. I believe it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;treasure trove&rdquo;—the more people who join, the more treasure there is, rather than a cake that gets smaller as it&rsquo;s divided.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: I reviewed the videos where the teacher talked about &ldquo;risk management&rdquo; and &ldquo;the person hiding in the cave&rdquo; (session 00523). I think they are incredibly valuable and have listened to them many times. I&rsquo;ve realized that to become truly wealthy, one needs to experience several bear markets to achieve a state of inner calm.</li>
<li>Sharing 3: Regarding the teacher&rsquo;s comment that &ldquo;whether you leave 20% or 30% cash in the end is not important,&rdquo; my understanding is that it depends on the size of one&rsquo;s total assets. For someone with assets of 1 billion, leaving 5% cash might be enough to live on for 20 years.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your understanding of the cash ratio is correct. The core idea is to calculate how many years your remaining cash can support your lifestyle; we typically use 10-15 years as a benchmark. For example, with 30% cash, if you use 2% per year, it will last 15 years; if you use 3% per year, it will last 10 years. The teacher also praised Bruce&rsquo;s proactive learning attitude, believing he will definitely succeed.</li>

<li>Questions (Canadian Investor):
<ol>
<li>In my IBKR account, is it correct to directly buy HXQ (the Canadian version of QQQ) in Canadian dollars as my core fund?</li>
<li>For the cash portion, I want to buy a non-dividend-paying Money Market fund. I could only find HSAV to buy with Canadian dollars, but its price fluctuates, which I don&rsquo;t quite understand. Should I convert to USD and buy BOXX instead?</li>
<li>Someone reminded me that Canadians holding U.S. assets face estate tax issues. What are your thoughts on this?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>Buying HXQ with Canadian dollars is correct.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s recommended to convert most of your cash (e.g., 25% of total assets) to USD and buy BOXX, as it has a higher interest rate and is non-dividend-paying, which avoids tax complications. At the same time, keep a small portion (e.g., 5%) of Canadian dollar cash in a Canadian money market fund for emergencies.</li>
<li>Estate tax is a valid concern, but it can be effectively managed by opening a &ldquo;Joint Account.&rdquo; Since you have already opened a joint account with your husband, you don&rsquo;t need to worry too much about this issue. For leveraged funds, Canada&rsquo;s QQU and TQQQ.TO are also usable options.</li>

<li>Sharing: I&rsquo;m 34 years old. After my assets reached 10 million TWD last year, I went all-in on 00662. I&rsquo;ve been through two downturns but my conviction is stronger, and I haven&rsquo;t sold a single share. He pointed out that many people in Taiwan are superstitious about 0050, but in reality, nearly 60% of 0050 is TSMC, making it highly concentrated in risk, far more so than QQQ. The entire market cap of the Taiwan stock market is less than that of Apple alone.</li>
<li>Question: I&rsquo;m concerned about the risk of war across the Taiwan Strait. I&rsquo;ve researched and found that historically, even in cases of defeat or occupation, the occupying force usually recognizes the stock assets of the citizens. Is this understanding correct?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your understanding is correct, but more importantly, the 00662 (QQQ) we invest in is a U.S. asset, holding the top 100 companies in the United States. Even if local assets in Taiwan are damaged, our U.S. dollar assets are safe. Therefore, it&rsquo;s more important to be prepared for personal safety (e.g., ensuring your passport is valid). From another perspective, when Taiwanese people invest in U.S. assets, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo; act because it helps to activate Taiwan&rsquo;s vast foreign exchange reserves, creating greater value for the entire society.</li>

<p>This session was a deep dive into the evolution of investment philosophy. Through the vivid &ldquo;animal evolution&rdquo; metaphor, Teacher James clearly analyzed the fundamental difference between successful and unsuccessful investors. It&rsquo;s not about how sophisticated their techniques are, but whether they can build a powerful system that can withstand extreme risks and endure through time cycles. The core strategy remains the beautifully simple &ldquo;buy and hold&rdquo; of a quality index fund (QQQ). At the same time, the course provided very practical guidance on asset activation and warned of the associated risks. Ultimately, investing is not just about accumulating wealth, but about gaining freedom of the mind to face life with composure and realize one&rsquo;s true value.</p>

<p>This session revolves around the core concept of long-term investing—a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; approach. James emphasizes that investors should ignore short-term market fluctuations, macroeconomic data, financial reports, and even political news, and instead, stick to buying and holding high-quality assets (like QQQ) for the long term. The key to success is not in predicting market highs and lows, but in proper risk management, which means using sensible asset allocation and maintaining sufficient cash reserves to handle any market condition. The market has no peak; it will only go higher. Investors should focus on the future 20 years from now, rather than worrying about tomorrow&rsquo;s ups and downs.</p>

<li><strong>&ldquo;Do Nothing&rdquo; Approach</strong>: The best investment strategy is to buy and then leave it alone; the market will naturally reach new highs. Trying to manage or predict the market is more likely to lead to failure.</li>
<li><strong>Ignore Market Noise</strong>: Investors don&rsquo;t need to care about what Trump or Putin says, nor should they pay attention to economic data like PPI and CPI or company earnings reports. This short-term information is irrelevant to long-term investing.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Time</strong>: Investing requires a long-term view, at least a 20-year horizon. Thinking about the person you want to become in 20 years is more meaningful than worrying about tomorrow&rsquo;s market. Getting rich overnight is impossible, but going bankrupt overnight is common, which is why risk control is crucial.</li>

<li><strong>Sources of Foreign Exchange Reserves</strong>: A country&rsquo;s foreign exchange reserves mainly come from two channels:
<ol>
<li><strong>Current Account</strong>: Earning foreign currency by exporting goods and services, such as TSMC&rsquo;s export revenues. These are called &ldquo;slave dollars&rdquo; because a great deal of labor is required to earn them.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Account</strong>: Inflow of foreign capital for investment (e.g., buying stocks). This capital can come and go quickly, easily causing financial turmoil and leading to national bankruptcy.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><strong>Reject Blind Imitation</strong>: Do not copy someone else&rsquo;s asset allocation plan. Everyone&rsquo;s plan is tailored to their age, asset size, risk tolerance, and financial goals (like retiring in 5 or 10 years). Learn the core spirit and logic of asset allocation, rather than mimicking specific percentages like a parrot.</li>
<li><strong>Account Advice for U.S. Investors</strong>: For investors in the United States, full advantage should be taken of the tax benefits of a Roth IRA account. It is an excellent tool for tax avoidance and inheritance. It is recommended to allocate at least one-third of your funds to a Roth account, which is particularly suitable for holding leveraged funds.</li>

<li><strong>The Right Investment</strong>: As long as it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;right investment&rdquo; (like QQQ) combined with &ldquo;long-term holding,&rdquo; you will definitely make a profit.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunity Cost is a Real Loss</strong>: Short-term paper losses are temporary and non-existent. However, the gains you miss out on due to hesitation (the money you could have earned) are a permanent and tangible loss.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If QQQ rises from 400 to 577, and you didn&rsquo;t buy at 400, you have permanently lost that 177 in profit. This loss can never be recovered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Act Immediately</strong>: Therefore, you should buy immediately when you have the money; this is the action with the highest expected value. The later you buy, the less you earn, the lower your wealth growth base becomes, and the wider the gap between you and others will grow.</li>

<li>Sharing: He recently read discussions about how AI will change the world, which made him feel that he shouldn&rsquo;t retire in the next 10 years. He feels he should work hard as this might be his last job opportunity, and he doesn&rsquo;t want to sell his growing QQQ for living expenses.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: The decision to work should not be based on fear of the future (like AI replacing jobs). You should ask yourself: Do you like your job? Are you working for money or for happiness? This is the fundamental reason that should determine whether you continue to work, regardless of the AI era or a future space age.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: He recently saw online discussions about &ldquo;geographic arbitrage,&rdquo; which involves moving to Southeast Asian countries with lower living costs (like Thailand or Vietnam) to make savings last longer. He wants to ask if this approach is feasible and what the risks or recommendations are.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;arbitrage&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s &ldquo;having no way out.&rdquo; Moving to a place you don&rsquo;t genuinely like just to save money is a form of external diseconomy and is not advisable. We should strive to live in an environment we like and find convenient, not be forced into a choice because of a lack of money. If you move to Hualien or Taitung because they are beautiful, that&rsquo;s the right choice even if it costs more than Taipei. But if it&rsquo;s just to save money, it&rsquo;s the wrong choice.</li>

<li>Sharing: He shared his understanding of &ldquo;happiness.&rdquo; In the past, his happiness came from external recognition like good grades or promotions. After learning James&rsquo;s financial concepts, he believes true happiness is simple, like seeing an old couple quietly eating an apple at the foot of Mount Fuji. At that moment, past achievements no longer mattered.</li>
<li>Question: He understands Adler&rsquo;s principle of &ldquo;separation of tasks,&rdquo; but he still feels sad when he sees friends and family struggling in the cycle of hard work. He knows he can&rsquo;t force them to change, but he wants to ask how to adjust this feeling of &ldquo;not being able to bear it.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: My view of happiness is &ldquo;whatever, it&rsquo;s all good, it doesn&rsquo;t matter&rdquo;—that is, happiness is having no burdens. The situation you described is much like a doctor&rsquo;s dilemma: seeing a patient who can&rsquo;t afford a necessary stent, the doctor is helpless. Poverty is a disease, and we can&rsquo;t save everyone; even the thousand-armed Guanyin has limits. What you can do is tell them the correct concept once, fulfilling your responsibility. Those who believe will be saved. For those who don&rsquo;t, you must learn to let go, or you won&rsquo;t be able to live your own life well.</li>

<li>Question: While listening to Howard Marks&rsquo;s audiobook, he understood that market cycles don&rsquo;t have a fixed length but are driven by the collective sentiment of the masses. When the market is extremely euphoric, it&rsquo;s a bubble, and vice versa. Is this understanding correct?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Your understanding is completely correct. The only indicator of a bubble, as Howard Marks says, is that &ldquo;investors have gone crazy&rdquo;; there are no other quantitative metrics. But the difficulty with this theory is in its execution. Everyone is in a different environment and has a different perception of the market&rsquo;s &ldquo;temperature,&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s very hard to pinpoint the peak.

<li>Sharing: She introduced James&rsquo;s investment philosophy to a very conservative elder, who ultimately only agreed to invest NT$20,000 per month into 006208 (a Taiwanese ETF) on a regular basis. She feels a bit anxious about this, thinking it&rsquo;s too slow.</li>
<li>Question: This elder insists they have an insurance policy bought 30-40 years ago with an 8% return. She suspects this was just a sales pitch from the agent back then and wants to ask how to explain to the elder that the actual return on this policy is likely not that high.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: First, don&rsquo;t be anxious. If the person involved isn&rsquo;t in a hurry, we shouldn&rsquo;t be either. You don&rsquo;t know if your advice will save them or harm them. What if they invest and the market drops in the short term? They will blame you. Taking it slow is a good thing. Regarding the insurance policy, an 8% return is almost impossible. You need to calculate the actual annualized rate of return (IRR or XIRR), not a simple arithmetic average. Especially considering the funds invested early on were locked up for 20-30 years with no return, the opportunity cost during that period is enormous. A rough estimate shows that if the same money (NT$750,000 invested annually for 20 years) were put into the market (at a 10% annualized return), it would become NT$100 million after 28 years. The policy, however, only pays out NT$1 million per year, making the return not even 1%. It&rsquo;s essentially a product from a &ldquo;scam group.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Sharing: A follow-up on family financial communication. He realized that for large investments (like consolidating a mortgage to free up several million), he must get his wife&rsquo;s consent. His current strategy is &ldquo;slowly might be faster,&rdquo; gradually gaining his wife&rsquo;s understanding and trust through continuous communication, sharing small gains, and explaining the long-term philosophy. He believes it&rsquo;s very important for a couple to be on the same page; otherwise, even if he makes money from investments, it could cause family conflicts.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Your approach is absolutely correct. Take it slow, and make sure your spouse feels involved and secure. For example, you can put a portion of the money from the loan into your wife&rsquo;s account for her to manage. When she sees cash in the account, she will feel more at ease. Never make decisions on your own. Even if you succeed, your partner might get angry for not being respected, which could lead to a broken marriage.</li>

<li>Question: James mentioned that one of the three principles of asset allocation is to consider the extreme scenario of &ldquo;interest rates rising to infinity.&rdquo; He is worried that if a situation like the 1980s in the U.S. occurs, with interest rates as high as 20%, our current backtesting models based on the last 20 years of data might not hold up. Is he worrying too much?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This is an excellent question. The way to deal with such an extreme situation is to hold more cash. If you are worried about a &ldquo;stagflation&rdquo; environment like the 1970s-1980s, where the stock market stagnated and interest rates were high, then your initial cash allocation should be higher, for example, increasing it from 30% to 40% or even 50%. Your cash reserve determines how much risk you can withstand.</li>

<li>Question: When he tries to &ldquo;awaken&rdquo; people around him, he finds two outcomes: one type awakens and starts taking action; the other type realizes they&rsquo;ve been wrong for decades and feels pain and despair. He doesn&rsquo;t know how to help the latter group and worries that awakening them without proper guidance might end up harming them.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: You are right about the &ldquo;systemic scam.&rdquo; Simply &ldquo;awakening&rdquo; someone is very dangerous because they might try to figure things out on their own and end up on the wrong path (like day trading), leading to bankruptcy. The correct approach is systematic education. You should guide them to watch our channel and learn the complete investment system from the beginning.

The rate of return I have gotten over the past 40 years and the rate of return you will get by investing for the next 40 years have the same expected value. Us encouraging you to buy doesn&rsquo;t make us more money. Everyone&rsquo;s investment is an independent event.

<li><strong>On Overseas Brokers (like Futu)</strong>: James strongly advises Taiwanese investors against using overseas brokers like Futu. The main risks are: 1. Issues with the Alternative Minimum Tax. 2. High estate taxes (potentially up to 40%). 3. If the investor has an accident, their heirs may not even find this account, and the inheritance process will be extremely difficult.</li>
<li><strong>On Exchange Rates</strong>: Investing is a decades-long endeavor; don&rsquo;t pay attention to short-term currency fluctuations. In the long run, exchange rates will fluctuate within a range and eventually converge to an expected value. Worrying about exchange rates will prevent you from doing anything.</li>
<li><strong>On the Cash Portion</strong>: The &ldquo;cash&rdquo; portion of asset allocation should absolutely not be invested in high-dividend stocks. High-dividend stocks are still stocks, they will fall, and they do not have the stability of cash. Cash should be allocated to truly safe assets like a Money Market Fund or short-term government bonds.</li>
<li><strong>On Other Funds</strong>: A student asked about actively managed funds like the Franklin Technology Fund. James&rsquo;s advice is to stop investing in such funds with high fees and potential redemption restrictions, and just buy 00662 (Taiwan&rsquo;s Nasdaq ETF) directly.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The market has no peak, it will only go higher.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: At the beginning of the session, James emphasized the long-term conviction investors should have, and not to feel fear or try to predict the top just because the market is making new highs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The money you miss out on earning is a permanent loss for your entire life&hellip; Earning less is a tangible loss.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When explaining why one should &ldquo;buy immediately with available cash,&rdquo; James pointed out that opportunity cost is a real and permanent loss, far more terrifying than short-term paper losses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You could have billions and not be able to spend it all, yet you&rsquo;re thinking of moving to a backward place&hellip; (just to save money) that&rsquo;s called having no way out.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When commenting on &ldquo;geographic arbitrage,&rdquo; James sharply pointed out that sacrificing quality of life and moving to an undesirable, cheap area due to financial constraints is not a wise move.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seeing others suffer, it&rsquo;s hard for us to save them&hellip; It&rsquo;s like Jesus, he spoke to someone&hellip; but then the person ran away because they didn&rsquo;t have enough money&hellip; and Jesus had to let go, there was nothing he could do.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: In answering Edwin&rsquo;s question on how to adjust his mindset when facing friends and family he can&rsquo;t help, James used this analogy to explain that all we can do is pass on the information. Whether the other person accepts it is beyond our control, and we must learn to let go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slowly might be faster.
&ndash; Jason</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Jason summarized this philosophical phrase when sharing his experience communicating investment concepts with his family, emphasizing the importance of patience and continuous communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a husband and wife are of one mind, they can break through metal. If they are not&hellip; even if you succeed, she might fly into a rage, &lsquo;You do everything without telling me.&rsquo;
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When commenting on family financial communication, James stressed the extreme importance of spousal consensus, otherwise even successful investments could destroy the family relationship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I said your [insurance policy] doesn&rsquo;t even pay out when it should, and he said, &lsquo;how much premium did you pay?&rsquo;&hellip; Wow, is that what you call insurance?
&ndash; James
Background: Recalling a debate with an insurance professional, James revealed the nature of some insurance products where the &ldquo;payout limit is tied to the premium paid,&rdquo; pointing out the limitations of their protective function.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take that fifteen million to buy insurance, you could have a hundred million&hellip; you only get one million a year&hellip; that&rsquo;s just taking one percent, and you&rsquo;re still smiling happily about it.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Through calculation, James revealed the extremely low rate of return on long-term savings insurance. Compared to investing in the market over the same period, the difference in returns is immense, representing a huge opportunity cost loss.</p>

</h2>
<p>This session once again reinforced the core idea of CLEC&rsquo;s long-term investing: simplify investment decisions and embrace the market&rsquo;s long-term growth. Through the concept of a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; approach, James urged investors to break free from the interference of short-term market noise and to focus on building a robust, personalized asset allocation, always maintaining sufficient cash as the ultimate defense against risk. The Q&amp;A session covered multiple dimensions, from personal mindset adjustments and family financial communication to the analysis of financial products like insurance. Using vivid examples and sharp insights, James exposed many common investment fallacies. The most central takeaway is that investing is a marathon of patience and discipline; taking immediate action and persisting for the long term is far more important than trying to find the perfect timing and valuation.</p>

Teacher James points out that having funds out of the market is the biggest risk, and investors should enter the market as soon as possible, adopting a &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, and never sell&rdquo; strategy. By debunking common market prediction indicators (like the Buffett Indicator) and analyzing asset allocation, he aims to help investors build a solid investment mindset to achieve long-term wealth growth.</p>

<li><strong>Market Volatility Doesn&rsquo;t Concern Me</strong>: For long-term investors, daily market fluctuations, global situations, tariff wars, etc., should not influence investment decisions. The market hitting new highs for three consecutive days proves the importance of staying in the market.</li>
<li><strong>Being Out of the Market is the Biggest Risk</strong>: Many people exit the market fearing a downturn, but waiting for a correction might mean never getting back in. Keeping funds out of the market and missing out on gains is a far greater risk than a short-term decline.</li>
<li><strong>Predictions are Useless, Making Money is What Matters</strong>: There are many who make correct market predictions, but the ones who actually make money are those who ignore the predictions and stay invested.</li>
<li><strong>The Market Always Goes Up</strong>: This is the core belief a long-term investor must have. Historical data proves that in the long run, the market only goes up and will always reach new highs. Investors should always be extremely optimistic and face the sun.</li>
<li><strong>Review the Past, Preview the Future</strong>: The teacher advises students, especially new ones, to watch videos from the market crashes at the end of 2018, March 2020, and in 2022 to learn how to react correctly during times of panic and to mentally prepare for future market volatility.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>No Risk in Long-Term Investing</strong>: Looking at a century of history, buying at any point and holding for the long term has always been profitable. However, short-term volatility can be immense, with potential drops of 50% or even 80%, so one must focus on long-term returns.</li>
<li><strong>The Nature of Your Funds Dictates Your Investment</strong>: Money needed for the short term (like tuition or a down payment for a house) must absolutely not be invested in the stock market; it should be kept as cash. Only long-term funds that you won&rsquo;t touch for 10-20 years are suitable for investment.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Asset Allocation</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Seek Stability Before Returns</strong>: Investment allocation should prioritize psychological stability. It is inadvisable for people to switch from an aggressive allocation (e.g., 442) to a conservative one (e.g., 433) when they can&rsquo;t handle the pressure during a market drop (like in April of this year).</li>
<li><strong>A Conservative Beta Value</strong>: It is recommended that an investor&rsquo;s Beta value not exceed 1.0. If you think you can handle 1.0, it&rsquo;s better to subtract 0.2 and adopt a Beta of 0.8, which might be more suitable.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Sufficient Cash</strong>: It&rsquo;s advisable to keep at least 30% in cash. For example, a portfolio of 70% QQQ + 30% Cash.</li>
<li><strong>Gradual Increase in Leverage</strong>: Newcomers to the market can start without using leveraged funds. During a market dip, you can use a small amount of cash (e.g., 2% of assets) to buy a 2x leveraged fund, thereby gradually building a leveraged position and allowing the Beta value to increase naturally as the market rises. This is like riding a smooth, high-class train rather than a bumpy race car.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Case: Currency Exchange Impact on 00662 vs. QLD</strong>
<ul>
<li>A student asked if the performance of 00662 (Fubon NASDAQ-100) lagged behind QLD due to the appreciation of the Taiwan Dollar (TWD).</li>
<li><strong>Teacher&rsquo;s Analysis</strong>: Comparisons must be made in the same currency. Assuming the exchange rate was 33 when investing in QQQ and is now 29, the exchange loss is 12%. Over the past 5 years, QLD&rsquo;s performance was about 128%, and 00662&rsquo;s was about 114%. However, after deducting the 12% currency exchange loss from QLD&rsquo;s 128%, its performance becomes about 112%, which is actually lower than 00662&rsquo;s 114%. The conclusion is that their performances are essentially the same; don&rsquo;t be misled by nominal figures in different currencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Debunking the &ldquo;Buffett Indicator&rdquo; Myth</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Many people use the &ldquo;Total Stock Market Capitalization / GDP&rdquo; ratio to judge if the market is overheated, which is wrong.</li>
<li><strong>GDP is a flow concept</strong>: It only measures the new value added in the current year.</li>
<li><strong>Market Cap is a stock concept</strong>: It includes the value of all of a company&rsquo;s historical investments and accumulated value.</li>
<li>Comparing a changing flow metric to a cumulative stock metric is like comparing apples and oranges; it&rsquo;s completely illogical.</li>
<li>Warren Buffett himself rarely mentions this indicator and emphasizes not to use a single indicator to judge the market. Many &ldquo;pundits&rdquo; and bloggers on the market abuse this concept just to get attention, like mindless &ldquo;parrots.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Beware of Investment Scams</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Teacher James <strong>solemnly declares</strong> that he provides <strong>completely free</strong> and <strong>voluntary teaching</strong>. He will never contact students privately, let alone offer financial services for a 1% fee or any other charge.</li>
<li>Anyone who uses his name on platforms like LINE or WeChat to contact you, claiming they can manage your finances for a fee, is a <strong>scammer</strong>.</li>
<li>In the US, it is illegal for an uncertified financial advisor to charge fees. The teacher stresses that no one cares more about your assets than you do; you must manage your investments yourself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Awakening to Capitalism</strong>: Teacher James puts forward a sharp point: laborers who go to work in modern society are, in essence, &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; of capitalism. The purpose of his teaching is to awaken everyone&rsquo;s &ldquo;capitalist consciousness,&rdquo; to learn to use capitalism to become capitalists, rather than being enslaved by it. (Refer to video <code>00315</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Ultimate Goals in Life</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Health and Longevity are Fundamental</strong>: Longevity is the path to wealth, and health is the mother of happiness. He reminds everyone to get health check-ups (like CT scans).</li>
<li><strong>Happiness is the purpose of life</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth is just the icing on the cake</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>The Principle of Borrowing to Invest</strong>:
<ul>
<li>For money borrowed according to proper principles, <strong>never think about paying it back</strong>.</li>
<li>Once you repay the loan, your risk (Beta value) will immediately increase. For example, an investor with 50% cash and 50% QQQ (Beta=0.5) who uses cash to repay a loan will see their Beta value skyrocket, greatly increasing their risk.</li>
<li>Having cash on hand gives you the confidence to face risks.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is a 65-year-old veteran investor who lost tens of millions in the stock market twice. After starting to learn Teacher James&rsquo;s philosophy after the Chinese New Year, although he had doubts about some points (about 10-15%), he found through deeper study that the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy is continuously refined and has deep logic.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: The market often says, &ldquo;If you miss the best few days of gains, your annualized return will drop significantly.&rdquo; What is the specific definition of this &ldquo;best time for gains&rdquo;?</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Regarding &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; versus &ldquo;mindless rebalancing,&rdquo; if the market is still rising at the end of the year, will rebalancing then cause one to miss out on subsequent gains?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>On Missing Up Days</strong>: This is precisely why it&rsquo;s important &ldquo;not to leave the market.&rdquo; Attempting to time the market will very likely cause you to miss the days with the biggest gains, leading to long-term returns far worse than those of an investor who &ldquo;never sells.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>On Rebalancing</strong>: Attempting &ldquo;smart,&rdquo; irregular rebalancing based on market movements is <strong>active investing</strong>, which cannot be taught because everyone&rsquo;s judgment criteria are different (add at a 10% drop? or 20%?). This approach can deplete your cash in an extreme market (like a three-year decline), leading to bankruptcy. Therefore, the simplest, safest, and most replicable method is to <strong>rebalance once a year</strong>. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that you didn&rsquo;t add more at the low point in April this year, because by the end of the year, your entire portfolio will still have appreciated significantly.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: For a portfolio of 60% QQQ, 10% QLD, and 30% cash, what is the Beta value? (Teacher&rsquo;s reply: 0.6 + 0.1*2 = 0.8)</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Can one use technical indicators (like the 200-day moving average) to assist in decision-making—becoming conservative when the price is below the average and aggressive when it&rsquo;s above?</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: Are people like Apple CEO Tim Cook considered capitalists or laborers?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>On Technical Indicators</strong>: Completely unnecessary. In the recent V-shaped recovery, using a 200-day moving average strategy would have had you sell and buy back at roughly the same point. Not only would you not have made a profit, you might have lost money on transaction fees, underperforming a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; strategy.</li>
<li><strong>On Tim Cook</strong>: He is a <strong>laborer</strong>, a very highly paid &ldquo;slave.&rdquo; His wealth comes from his salary (including stock options), not from returns on his own invested capital. True capitalists do not have to go to work.</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: What should she do with the Japanese Yen she holds?</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: She has about $200,000 USD in cash (cost basis ~32 TWD/USD) and has already invested $100,000 in US stocks (QQQ/SPY/VT). Now she doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with the remaining cash because she heard the teacher say there are tax issues for Taiwanese people buying US stocks.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Handling the Yen</strong>: Immediately, right now, exchange it for TWD and buy 00662. Don&rsquo;t worry about the exchange rate loss, because the potential return from the stock market is far greater than currency fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Handling the USD Assets</strong>: Again, ignore the exchange rate. For Taiwanese investors, the best approach is to sell the holdings in the US brokerage, transfer the funds back to Taiwan, and buy 00662 with all of it to avoid future estate tax issues. In the long run, the exchange rates for entering and exiting the market will average out, so there&rsquo;s no need for excessive worry.</li>

All new funds in the future should be invested in QQQ. In the future, Bitcoin might be used as collateral like gold, so you may not need to sell it.

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is 65 and retired. During the recent downturn, his allocation was too aggressive (Beta 1.1), and he had no cash to add at the bottom. He has now adjusted to a Beta of 0.9 (70% QQQ, 10% QLD, 20% Cash).</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Is there a mechanical rule for deploying cash during a major market drop? For example, investing one-third of the cash when the market drops 20%?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This falls under active management. If you must do it, you could consider this: when the market drops 10% (happens almost every year), you can add more once; when it drops 20% (happens every few years), you can add more again. If it continues to fall, you must be very cautious, as it could be a major bear market. At that point, you should switch to a defensive posture, not continue to add. The key is to <strong>never run out of cash</strong>, and the goal of adding to your position is to <strong>maintain your original Beta value (0.9)</strong>, not to raise it.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is due to the <strong>volatility decay</strong> characteristic of leveraged ETFs. In volatile and declining markets, the drop in leveraged ETFs will be more than a multiple of the index&rsquo;s drop, and their recovery is also slower. This is why a full position in leveraged funds is not recommended. For those holding leveraged funds, adding to your position during a major market drop can help you break even faster. For those with a salary, you should normally buy QQQ and use your salary to buy TQQQ during major market dips.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Being out of the market is actually the biggest risk.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This point was central to the entire session. The teacher repeatedly emphasized that compared to the risk of a short-term market decline, the risk of investors exiting out of fear and thereby missing out on huge long-term returns is far greater.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today&rsquo;s laborers who go to work are like the cotton pickers brought from Africa to America in the past. All who work in factories today are slaves to capitalism.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a very sharp and thought-provoking view from the teacher, aimed at awakening people to the nature of capitalism and encouraging them to become capitalists through investment, thereby escaping the status of a &ldquo;laborer.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Longevity is the path to wealth, happiness is the purpose of life, health is the mother of happiness, and wealth is just the icing on the cake.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher shared his philosophy of life, emphasizing what is truly important. Wealth is meant to serve a better life, not be the ultimate goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone says, &ldquo;Pay me 1% and I can be your investment advisor&rdquo;&hellip; that is a scam.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher directly used the language of scammers as an example to strongly remind all students that anyone impersonating him and offering paid financial advice is a scam, urging everyone to protect their assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t defend justice with your own body; we are not martyrs.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This was the core advice given in response to the question about how a child should face school bullying. He stressed that under any circumstances, personal safety is the highest priority, teaching children to uphold their sense of justice while also learning to protect themselves wisely.</p>

<p>This session once again stressed the core discipline of long-term investing: ignore short-term market volatility and firmly believe in the market&rsquo;s long-term upward trend. By analyzing asset allocation, the use of leveraged funds, and debunking common myths like the Buffett Indicator, Teacher James pointed out a simple yet effective path to wealth growth. The Q&amp;A session was rich in content, covering profound discussions from specific investment strategies (like rebalancing timing and leveraged fund allocation) to life philosophies (such as dealing with bullying and the nature of capitalism). The central idea of the entire session is that investors should build a strong psychological foundation, focus on controllable investment principles, and simultaneously pursue a life of health, happiness, and longevity, viewing wealth as a tool for a better life, not the ultimate goal.</p>

<p>The core of this lecture is to emphasize <strong>persisting in long-term investment in the Nasdaq 100 index fund, prioritizing risk control and reasonable asset allocation, and maintaining an extremely optimistic investment mindset</strong>. Teacher James points out that market volatility is normal; investors should ignore short-term fluctuations, focus on long-term growth, recognize the critical role of cash in asset allocation, and ultimately achieve financial freedom and life&rsquo;s purpose.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Market&rsquo;s Normal State</strong>: Global situations and market turmoil are normal. Investors should remain calm and not be disturbed by short-term volatility, international affairs, market analysis, financial statements, or economic conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This channel is a pro bono sharing platform and does not constitute investment advice. There are no fees, no alternate accounts, and be wary of scams.

<li><strong>Learning Path</strong>: Newcomers are advised to start with &ldquo;00451 The One-Dollar Investment Lecture,&rdquo; think independently, and find a method that suits them. Quiet study improves the quality of thought more than joining too many groups.</li>
<li><strong>Core Investment Vehicle</strong>: Focus on the Nasdaq 100 index fund (like QQQ). Page 10 of the handout provides a selection of related funds worldwide. The videos started in 2018, and there is a complete 2022 course playlist available.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Mentality</strong>: Always be extremely optimistic, always face the sun; the market will eventually go up. Investing requires patience (ignoring market fluctuations), and financial freedom is worth the wait. Please like, comment, and subscribe on all platforms.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stablecoins and Short-Term Treasuries</strong>: A student asked if the issuance of stablecoins would increase demand for short-term treasuries and lower their interest rates. Teacher James believes short-term treasury rates are tied to the central bank&rsquo;s rates and won&rsquo;t fall significantly because of this. Short-term treasuries are similar to money market funds with low volatility. The central bank&rsquo;s rate is the benchmark; no one would buy a bond with a lower rate.</li>
<li><strong>The Trap of Long-Term Bonds</strong>: Long-term bond interest is linked to inflation expectations for many years to come, and the interest is fixed.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: For a 30-year Treasury bond with a 5% coupon rate, if inflation is 3%, the real annualized rate of return (Real IRR) is only 1.94%. In contrast, if short-term rates are 4%, it is far superior to the real return of long-term bonds. The $5 in interest you receive after 30 years will have long been devalued.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: It is not recommended for individual investors to buy long-term government bonds. Issuing long-term bonds is advantageous for the U.S. Treasury because the long-term interest is close to zero for the issuer (after considering inflation). Even if the central bank&rsquo;s rate is below 2%, buying long-term bonds is not necessarily a good deal. The Treasury has its own issuance plan and won&rsquo;t easily change it due to shifts in the central bank&rsquo;s rates. The idea of issuing 100-year bonds is impractical and tantamount to default.</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Awareness</strong>: The first priority in investing is risk control; the world is full of uncertainties (like the conflict in Israel).</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Asset Allocation</strong>: Good asset allocation is a &ldquo;master strategy&rdquo; (奇门遁甲), a powerful &ldquo;Army, Navy, and Air Force&rdquo; deployment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash</strong>: The &ldquo;food and air&rdquo; of asset allocation, the most important part. Sufficient cash prevents market panic.</li>
<li><strong>Index Fund</strong>: The &ldquo;aircraft carrier&rdquo; of asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraged Fund</strong>: Like the &ldquo;missile force.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging</strong>: The &ldquo;Transformer&rdquo; of asset allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Courage to Sell a House for Investment</strong>: Selling your primary residence to rent and investing the funds in an index is an excellent financial strategy, but it requires a strong mind and the courage to face social judgment (e.g., fear of being told you&rsquo;re &ldquo;not doing well&rdquo;). In reality, this is a sign of &ldquo;doing exceptionally well.&rdquo;</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Difficulty of Educating Family and Friends</strong>: Family and friends would rather trust the annuities and savings insurance (1% return) recommended by bank advisors than accept advice about index funds (10% long-term return), even when presented with spreadsheets. The main reason is the fear of &ldquo;what if it drops?&rdquo;
<ul>
<li><strong>Counter-strategy</strong>: First, become a &ldquo;big tree&rdquo; yourself and influence them with your own success. Your words carry little weight when you&rsquo;re insignificant; &ldquo;familiarity breeds contempt&rdquo; (近庙欺神). It&rsquo;s hard to distinguish &ldquo;saints&rdquo; from &ldquo;demons&rdquo; in society.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive Roots of the Wealth Gap</strong>: Poverty is often caused by a lack of awareness, not systemic issues. CLEC aims to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; this &ldquo;disease of poverty,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s very difficult; even family members may not accept it. Some people can&rsquo;t accept good medicine and instead buy things like long-term bonds.</li>
<li><strong>The Challenges of Individual Stock Investing</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: NVIDIA&rsquo;s stock price fluctuates wildly. It was once sold off due to poor sales and excess inventory, then soared because of AI. It&rsquo;s difficult for individual investors to grasp; even if you bought it, you might not have held on for the entire ride.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Individual stocks are volatile, information is asymmetric, and they can suddenly be cut in half or go to zero. ETFs provide a more stable way to share in market growth. It&rsquo;s also very hard to stick with a portfolio of mixed-quality individual stocks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Dangers of Short-Term Trading</strong>: Short-term trading is like &ldquo;gambling + drug addiction.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s addictive and leads not only to financial loss but also the loss of family, health, and self, potentially ruining one&rsquo;s entire life. There&rsquo;s no need to become a &ldquo;boy wonder trader.&rdquo;</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profit Motives of Banks and Insurance Companies</strong>: Criticizes post offices and banks for persuading depositors (especially the elderly) to buy annuity insurance, structured notes, and similar products. This is a failure of financial regulators.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Issues</strong>: Believes financial regulators should ensure the separation of savings, insurance, wealth management, and lending to avoid conflicts of interest. American commercial banks (like BofA) don&rsquo;t proactively sell insurance. Taiwan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Financial Holding Company&rdquo; model is described as an &ldquo;all-encompassing, one-stop-shop scam.&rdquo; Charles Schwab only mentions loan options when a client has a large funding need.</li>
<li><strong>The Goal of the Insurance Industry</strong>: To convert large amounts of fixed deposits into insurance policies, which is the main objective of the insurance industry, given the huge amount of fixed deposits in Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>The Risk of Mortgaging Property to Buy Insurance</strong>: There have been cases where the property mortgage remains, but the insurance policy&rsquo;s value drops to zero, leaving people homeless. These institutions &ldquo;will go as far as making people homeless.&rdquo;</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>On Publishing a Book/Media Exposure</strong>: Teacher James frankly states that if he were to publicly promote his ideas like &ldquo;investing with loans&rdquo; and &ldquo;not buying a house,&rdquo; he could violate financial regulations (practicing without a license), offend powerful interest groups (real estate, insurance, finance), and even face cyberbullying and political pressure (being labeled &ldquo;pro-Taiwan independence&rdquo; or &ldquo;pro-CCP&rdquo;). He could be &ldquo;torn to shreds&rdquo; or even &ldquo;end up in jail.&rdquo; If he doesn&rsquo;t discuss many of these topics, the teaching loses its meaning. The very people you help might turn around and curse you.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance</strong>: An insurance policy with a 1.06% annual return is acceptable if it includes protection, but it&rsquo;s generally not recommended.</li>
<li><strong>Caring for Parents</strong>: Re-emphasizes the loneliness and health risks of elderly people living alone (not taking medicine on time, not measuring blood sugar/pressure, leading to complications like worsening COPD, minor strokes, brain atrophy, mental disorders). Advises children to pay attention and provide companionship early. Even if parents seem self-sufficient, consider arranging for a caregiver early to prevent accidents and ensure a regular routine (medication, diet, avoiding falls). Shares his regret of not returning to Taiwan in time to accompany his mother, who, despite having other children in Taiwan, was not adequately cared for while living alone. Emphasizes that parents&rsquo; health is the children&rsquo;s happiness.</li>
<li><strong>A Partner&rsquo;s Investment Philosophy</strong>: Accept individual differences. Due to different upbringings and personal experiences (like living through the dot-com and 2008 bubbles), security levels and cognitions vary. Lead by example and influence them gradually with long-term results; don&rsquo;t force it. It&rsquo;s normal for them not to listen to you, just as you may not listen to them.</li>
<li><strong>00662 (Taiwan ETF) Currency Impact</strong>: Short-term currency fluctuations are normal. For instance, when the Taiwan dollar depreciated in the previous two years, 00662 outperformed QQQ. In the long run, currency effects tend to cancel each other out.</li>
<li><strong>Credit Loans vs. Stock Pledges</strong>: Credit loans are relatively independent and safe. Stock pledges are high-risk; a sharp market downturn could trigger a margin call, making it like a &ldquo;loan shark&rdquo; — you have to pay back when they demand it, or you&rsquo;re &ldquo;shot dead with one bullet.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Brokerage Firms Raising Pledge Rates and Risks</strong>: Brokerages like Capital Securities in Taiwan might raise interest rates after a client has borrowed, or even restrict withdrawals (due to limited funding pools), &ldquo;luring you into a trap.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s advisable to prioritize more stable brokerages like Yuanta Securities.</li>
<li><strong>Apply for Credit Loans Early</strong>: Bank credit policies can change. When you qualify (e.g., with an interest rate below 2%), you should apply early. Seize the opportunity when a bank proactively offers you a loan.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging in Hong Kong</strong>: HSBC is a good choice, especially for VIP clients with large capital (e.g., over 1 million HKD). HSBC&rsquo;s pledge interest rates are currently low. Friends from Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, etc., who successfully open an account and get a pledge loan from HSBC are welcome to share their experiences.</li>
<li><strong>QQQ Compounding</strong>: The annualized rate of return (CAGR), according to Teacher James&rsquo;s research, is around 18% (including dividend reinvestment).</li>
<li><strong>Repayment of Investment Mortgage</strong>: Typically, it&rsquo;s a lump-sum repayment at maturity (10-15 years). By then, you can sell some stocks or use another pledged loan to repay it. You need more than 15 years to ensure profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Compound Frequency</strong>: Refers to capital gains and dividend reinvestment.</li>
<li><strong>Philosophy of Helping Others</strong>: There are different levels of helping others. The lowest is for others (hoping for their well-being). The next is for oneself (deriving happiness or meaning from it). The highest is selflessness (helping is a natural act, regardless of for whom, or whether it brings happiness, like the Buddha or Jesus; it&rsquo;s natural ethics). Using helping others to add meaning and happiness to one&rsquo;s own life is actually &ldquo;not right.&rdquo; The highest state is &ldquo;like water flowing without a trace&rdquo; (传过水无痕).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: An elderly friend, who was once very influential in the market, agrees with Teacher James&rsquo;s index investing philosophy. This elder confessed that his past outsized returns were due to information asymmetry and his influence (manipulating small-cap stocks), which is not replicable for ordinary investors. He believes it&rsquo;s not easy for ordinary people to make money in the market, and index investing is the most correct path.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Index investing not only makes you money but also gives you a &ldquo;life&rdquo; (improves quality of life). Even if you make money from short-term trading, you might lose your life due to constant anxiety (e.g., being unable to take a 15-day vacation with peace of mind).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sharing (Follow-up)</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Reflecting on her family life, she emphasizes love and companionship for her parents to avoid regrets. She sees Teacher James&rsquo;s actions as &ldquo;dedication&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;charity&rdquo; with a sense of superiority and feels for the misunderstandings he might face.</li>
<li>Shares her future plans: to establish a women&rsquo;s financial academy (focusing on female financial awareness, as Chinese women are relatively disadvantaged, and financial independence provides more confidence), volunteer in hospice care (to learn about &ldquo;fasting until death&rdquo; and euthanasia), travel, read, and set up scholarships, reflecting a desire for &ldquo;altruism&rdquo; (influenced by Kazuo Inamori&rsquo;s philosophy of &ldquo;altruism&rdquo;).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Commends Kacy&rsquo;s practice of accompanying her parents. Shares the joy of his own father, in his 90s, still planning a trip to Korea. Advises that for elderly parents, even if they appear healthy, one should consider arranging for a caregiver early to prevent accidents and ensure a regular routine (medication, diet). Parents&rsquo; health is the children&rsquo;s happiness. If parents have medical needs, like follow-up visits every three months or low-dose lung cancer screenings, they should be supported.</li>
<li>Greatly admires Kacy&rsquo;s &ldquo;altruistic&rdquo; plans, believing that from a women&rsquo;s financial academy to educating disadvantaged groups, it&rsquo;s all very meaningful. It&rsquo;s right to start planning now.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: His mother noticed his mood has become calmer and happier recently. He explained it&rsquo;s because through investing (practicing the teacher&rsquo;s teachings), he has found meaning in life and is confident about his future wealth, no longer worrying about finances. This has led to an internal change from external influences.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Shares his own longing and regrets regarding his mother, how in his youth he failed to fully grasp the loneliness and hardship of an elderly person living alone (e.g., his mother falling while going to the doctor alone, and his own failure to return to Taiwan to be with her). Reminds everyone to care for their parents, especially those living alone, after achieving financial freedom early, to avoid life&rsquo;s regrets. Advises young people to learn from wise elders (like Warren Buffett) to avoid many pitfalls and find a &ldquo;mental coach.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Following the teacher&rsquo;s guidance, he used an investment mortgage to invest in 00662. After using a portion of the funds from high-dividend ETFs to pay the monthly interest, there&rsquo;s still a surplus each month. Should he invest this in 00865 (short-term bond/cash-like ETF) or continue buying fractional shares of 00662?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Continue buying 00662. The emergency fund (00865) only needs to be built up to a certain level (e.g., 2-3 years of living expenses for someone employed). Any excess funds should be invested in growth assets.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: Recalls entering the market in 2018, with emotions fluctuating with the market, having once lost 50%. A wise friend enlightened her (&ldquo;Save money when you&rsquo;re making it, and just wait it out when it&rsquo;s down&rdquo;), teaching her to remain calm through ups and downs and become numb to the market. Mentions how wealthy people view money (a piece of clothing costs 500-600k; money is like trash to them). Grateful for the teacher&rsquo;s guidance that has &ldquo;filled her head.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: Has come to understand the teacher&rsquo;s mindset that &ldquo;all sharing is for self-fulfillment, not for rewards.&rdquo; When sharing investment ideas with others, she encounters different reactions: some (who have worked for 20-30 years and are set in their ways) cling to old concepts, while others, despite living in hardship (a single mother working two jobs), are willing to listen. Through sharing, she has also gained a sense of value by giving back the knowledge she has learned.

<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: (Regarding Sharing 2) Helping others can bring happiness, but the highest state is to be &ldquo;unaffected by helping,&rdquo; meaning helping others is a natural act, not for happiness, not for self. The lowest level is &ldquo;for others,&rdquo; i.e., for their benefit; the second level is &ldquo;for oneself,&rdquo; i.e., achieving self-actualization through helping (the teacher admits his own teaching is to find value in retirement); the highest is &ldquo;selflessness,&rdquo; where even the thought of &ldquo;for myself&rdquo; is gone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: After sharing investment concepts with friends, how can she determine if they truly understand? Are there any questions to ask to test them? (Friends listen and think it&rsquo;s logical but can&rsquo;t articulate it themselves.)
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: It&rsquo;s hard to judge with simple questions. True understanding is reflected in action (like opening an account to invest). A more effective way is like how Frank guided him back in the day (meeting for dinner every week, hand-holding him through opening an account, starting with a $200 Mutual Fund), guiding them step-by-step to open an account, make their first investment, and follow up continuously. This is a process of &ldquo;sowing seeds&rdquo;; whether and when they sprout is unknown. He himself was &ldquo;led by the hand&rdquo; by Frank to get started. Now, he is willing to be such a guide, with the Bodhisattva spirit of &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t descend into hell, who will?&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Gained insights from gardening.
<ol>
<li><strong>Individual Differences</strong>: The same seeds planted result in different flowers, just as people receive information differently. Their internal &ldquo;genes&rdquo; determine their level of acceptance and reaction (some &ldquo;get it,&rdquo; others &ldquo;laugh it off&rdquo;). The gardener (the sharer) cannot change the seed&rsquo;s nature.</li>
<li><strong>Patient Guidance</strong>: A good gardener will loosen the soil and water, helping it grow, just as a mentor guides students to open accounts and invest.</li>
<li><strong>Inner Joy</strong>: The pleasure derived from tilling the soil and weeding surpasses the rewards of all fame and fortune. This effort is not for a return but for self-actualization.</li>
<li><strong>Practical Example</strong>: She once guided a friend to buy QQQ. The friend sold during a dip and missed the subsequent 45% gain. She only sent a screenshot and said no more, believing it was also &ldquo;fate.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Translating for the Elderly at a Doctor&rsquo;s Visit</strong>: Shares her experience as a volunteer translator for the elderly, realizing their immense need in medical communication. Such small acts can bring great help and a ray of light into their lives.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Agrees with the views on &ldquo;destiny&rdquo; and intrinsic motivation. Shares his own experience of planting tomatoes, where three seeds grew very differently; one was a &ldquo;chosen seedling&rdquo; and very robust, while others were &ldquo;sickly.&rdquo; Cites Dr. Yang Ding-I&rsquo;s view to &ldquo;look inward.&rdquo; For people you can&rsquo;t change, don&rsquo;t force it.

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Came into contact with CLEC in 2024 through a friend (who had mentioned it 5 years ago, but she was indifferent at the time). In her 50s, she has been interested in investing since graduating from college and has been exploring on her own for years. She was deeply moved after listening to the lectures and has invested a lot of time in studying (finished the 2021-2022 courses and is now re-listening). She shared it with a hundred people, and only two took action, but she still feels gratified.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Regarding the choice between a credit loan and a stock pledge in Taiwan. She leans towards using the stock pledge first (2.56% interest, no principal repayment, only interest), because of its convenience. She thinks she can use a credit loan (already approved for a 3 million TWD limit, but requires installment repayments) as a backup if the stock market crashes. She believes her job is stable (banks are always begging her to take out loans), so she&rsquo;s not afraid of unemployment and can access the credit loan anytime.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: (In a firm tone, repeatedly emphasizing) <strong>Absolutely do not do this!</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: Money borrowed from a stock pledge <strong>must not be reinvested in the stock market</strong>. It can only be used for living expenses or to repay other loans. This is &ldquo;the first thing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Huge Risk</strong>: When the market crashes, banks may tighten credit (&ldquo;take away the umbrella in the rain&rdquo;), and you might not be able to borrow money then. If you lose your job at the same time, it&rsquo;s even more impossible. A credit loan is not something you can just &ldquo;hold there&rdquo; forever.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy All Troops (韩信点兵)</strong>: All available &ldquo;forces&rdquo; (including the credit loan) should be deployed to the &ldquo;battlefield&rdquo; (investment) as early as possible.</li>
<li><strong>The Correct Approach</strong>: You should first take out the credit loan (e.g., 3 million TWD) and invest it in the market. The monthly loan repayments can be paid using funds from a low-interest stock pledge. This way, the principal continues to work in the market, and your personal salary can also be invested. Don&rsquo;t take a huge risk just because you&rsquo;re &ldquo;too lazy to repay the principal&rdquo; or tempted by the short-term convenience of a pledge.</li>
<li><strong>Safety of Credit Loans</strong>: A credit loan is a relatively safe form of leverage, not directly linked to market fluctuations, and you won&rsquo;t get a margin call. With a stock pledge, even if you only borrow 10% (e.g., pledging 1 million from a 10 million asset portfolio—the teacher thinks 10% is already a huge risk, let alone the 2-3 million she wants to borrow), you could face risks in an extreme market downturn.</li>
<li><strong>Brokerage Risk</strong>: Some brokerages in Taiwan (like Capital Securities) may change their pledge interest rates, and their limited funding pools might prevent you from withdrawing funds as needed.
(Kacy and other students also chimed in, emphasizing the risk of banks &ldquo;taking away the umbrella in the rain&rdquo; and the fundamental difference between credit loans and pledges, and that pledged money cannot be used to buy more stocks).</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Market fluctuations have nothing to do with me, international affairs have nothing to do with me, market analysis has nothing to do with me, financial statements have nothing to do with us, and the economic situation doesn&rsquo;t matter at all. Don&rsquo;t pay attention to it. The more you pay attention, the more mistakes you&rsquo;ll make.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Teacher James emphasized at the beginning the composure investors should have, not letting external noise affect their investment decisions.</p>

<p>Background: Student IM sharing her transformation from anxiously watching the market to maintaining a calm composure towards market fluctuations.</p>

<p>In this session, Teacher James systematically re-emphasized his core investment philosophy: consistently buy and hold the Nasdaq 100 index fund, fearless of short-term market volatility. He focused on analyzing the extreme importance of risk control, viewing reasonable asset allocation (especially an adequate cash reserve) as the cornerstone of investment success. Through specific examples, the teacher revealed the investment value trap of long-term bonds and severely criticized certain misleading and detrimental practices in the financial industry, especially warning investors against low-return products like annuities and savings insurance. At the same time, he pointed out the huge uncertainty of individual stock investing and the destructive nature of short-term trading. During the Q&amp;A session, students actively shared their insights and confusions from their investment practices, family communication, and personal growth. Teacher James not only provided specific investment advice (such as the correct use and risk perception of credit loans versus stock pledges) but also guided students from a life philosophy perspective to reflect on the meaning of wealth, work, family, and personal value, encouraging everyone on the path to financial freedom to continuously enhance their cognition, maintain a positive mindset, pay attention to family and social responsibilities, and ultimately give back to society.</p>

He delves into strategies for personal wealth accumulation within the capitalist system, including correctly understanding risk, rationally using leverage (advising conservatism for most), and balancing wealth inheritance with life&amp;#39;s meaning.

He emphasizes that investors should focus on quality passive ETFs like the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQQ) and possess the patience and optimism for long-term holding. Simultaneously, he deeply analyzes the impact of the capitalist system on different social classes, how to utilize capital markets to achieve personal and family financial freedom, and explores profound topics such as the relationship between wealth accumulation and life happiness, family relationships, children&rsquo;s education, elderly care for parents, and wealth inheritance.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No need to pay attention to market signals</strong>: Market disturbances (like tariffs, wars) are irrelevant to long-term investing; the market will eventually rise, and approaching or even setting new highs is normal. Investors need not worry about short-term signals.
<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> The current market is full of turmoil, yet it&rsquo;s close to setting new highs, proving that short-term signals are inconsequential.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Learn from history, understand the present</strong>: The century-long history of the U.S. stock market shows that while it doesn&rsquo;t repeat, it rhymes astonishingly. Understanding history helps solidify long-term investment beliefs. Mr. James shares insights based on his 40 years of market experience and understanding of 200 years of U.S. market history.</li>
<li><strong>Optimism and patience</strong>: Investors should always be extremely optimistic and unaffected by external pessimism and fear-mongering. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t listen or look, it doesn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo; Wealth is worth waiting for; investing requires patience.</li>
<li><strong>Technical analysis is ineffective</strong>: Those who believe technical analysis is effective haven&rsquo;t truly grasped investing. Market fluctuations can sometimes be like &ldquo;madness&rdquo;; no need to dance to its tune.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQQ)</strong>: This is currently the fastest-growing passive ETF globally, suitable for young investors to accelerate asset appreciation. Mr. James provides links to resources for investing in Nasdaq 100 Index Funds worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Learning resources</strong>: Recommends watching a series of videos (e.g., 00451 &ldquo;Value Investing Lecture&rdquo; as a compulsory course for newcomers, as well as 398, 399, 400, etc.), learning them in conjunction with the market conditions at the time to achieve a solid grasp.</li>
<li><strong>Getting started for young professionals/small investors</strong>: It&rsquo;s advised to set aside an emergency fund for six months to a year before starting to invest in QQQ or 00662 (a Taiwanese ETF tracking Nasdaq 100).

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systemic traps of capitalism</strong>: Mr. James quotes and agrees with a YouTuber&rsquo;s perspective that capitalism is designed to favor the rich, reflected in:
<ul>
<li><strong>Tax mechanisms</strong>: Investment income (e.g., U.S. Long-term Capital Gains, tax-free for singles up to $40k/couples up to $80k, with rates of 15%-20% above that) is taxed at much lower rates than labor income (up to 37%), benefiting long-term investors. Taiwan doesn&rsquo;t even have capital gains tax.</li>
<li><strong>Triple risks for the middle class</strong>: Job, company stock, and property near the company are highly intertwined. If the company has problems, one might lose their job, stock value, and property (or face mortgage pressure) simultaneously. Advice: Sell company stock promptly and reinvest in QQQ; buy a house only after achieving financial freedom (&ldquo;buying a house should be like buying slippers&rdquo;).</li>
<li><strong>Differences in borrowing</strong>: The rich borrow money to get richer (investment), while the middle class borrows money to become poorer (consumption).</li>
<li><strong>Differences in income growth</strong>: Income from physical labor struggles to keep pace with inflation and asset appreciation.</li>
<li><strong>Differences in offspring development</strong>: Middle-class children rely on &ldquo;involution&rdquo; (cram schools, prestigious universities, spending hundreds of thousands to get into private schools), while wealthy children can pursue their interests and grow up happily.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of financial bubbles</strong>: The middle class is forced to sell assets at low prices when bubbles burst because they can&rsquo;t hold on, while the rich have the money and opportunity to buy the dip.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Utilizing capitalism</strong>: Despite its pitfalls, the capital market is an important way for ordinary people to bridge the wealth gap and share the dividends of social progress.
<ul>
<li><strong>At the national level</strong>: If citizens all become capitalists, holding shares in globally competitive companies (like TSMC, Apple), they can enjoy the benefits of globalization while &ldquo;transferring&rdquo; negative externalities of production (like pollution). Citizens should ponder: Is it better to be proud of owning a factory, or proud of owning shares in that factory?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Borrow 100 Million&rdquo; thought experiment</strong>: If someone were willing to lend you 100 million (any currency) at 5% interest, to be repaid in 40 years, would you dare to borrow it? Those who dare and know how to use it possess a rich mindset, because this money, through investment, can generate returns far exceeding the interest, potentially allowing for immediate retirement. The key is whether you have the credit or assets to borrow this sum.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration from Trump&rsquo;s proposed &ldquo;Great Child America Act&rdquo;</strong>: Investing $1,000 annually for newborns from a young age cultivates financial literacy and long-term compound interest awareness, reflecting a nation&rsquo;s soft power. This is more meaningful than direct subsidies.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beyond &ldquo;cost&rdquo; thinking</strong>: Falling in love, getting married, and having children should not be calculated as &ldquo;costs.&rdquo; With a long-term wealth perspective (e.g., 1 million becoming 1 billion in 40 years), money is meant to be spent, and family is for sharing love.
<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> If you only think about the immediate 1 million not being enough, you miss the possibility of becoming a billionaire enjoying life in the future. By 60-70, even with money, you might not be able to make up for regrets from youth (like having children).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Die with Zero&rdquo; philosophy</strong>: Life should be fully experienced, rather than dying with a huge fortune, which is the tragedy of &ldquo;having nothing but money.&rdquo; Money should be spent wisely to create beautiful memories.</li>
<li><strong>Financial wisdom for couples</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic security</strong>: The higher-earning spouse should proactively transfer a portion of their funds (e.g., 50k from a 150k salary) to the other&rsquo;s account, giving them financial freedom and security, avoiding the need to &ldquo;report everything&rdquo; or &ldquo;ask for money.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Common goals</strong>: Couples should have aligned financial views, invest together, and not bicker over money (like who does the dishes or takes out the trash). A home needs love.</li>
<li><strong>Improve oneself first</strong>: In a family, first make yourself &ldquo;worthy of being loved.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Becoming the &ldquo;big tree&rdquo; of the family</strong>: Through long-term investment, everyone has the potential (hundreds of thousands becoming hundreds of millions, millions becoming billions) to become the family&rsquo;s economic pillar, providing shelter for loved ones.</li>
<li><strong>Elderly care for parents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Health is the biggest money-saver</strong>: Instead of worrying if pensions are sufficient, care more about parents&rsquo; health, manage their blood pressure and blood sugar, ensure they take medication on time, and have regular check-ups (e.g., for macular degeneration, joints, carotid artery stents). Healthy parents mean a lighter burden for children.</li>
<li><strong>Cost estimation</strong>: If parents are completely dependent, a caregiver plus basic expenses might cost NT$80,000-100,000 per month. Mr. James&rsquo;s mother cost about NT$10 million over 10 years.</li>
<li><strong>Plan early</strong>: When children are 30, parents are around 60. Significant expenses might arise after age 80. Regularly investing NT$1,000-2,000 per month for parents can accumulate a considerable pension fund after 20 years.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Simplify investing</strong>: Once asset allocation is done, you can set it to &ldquo;autopilot,&rdquo; no need to watch the market daily or analyze asset performance. Spending 5 minutes once a year for rebalancing is sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>Risk awareness</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Market goes to zero&rdquo; test</strong>: Before any investment decision, ask yourself, &ldquo;If this investment goes to zero tomorrow, can I handle it? Even if I can&rsquo;t sell stocks for three years, can I survive?&rdquo; If not, the risk is too high.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity risk</strong>: Some markets or specific situations (like some mainland China ETFs in 2022) may experience situations where you want to sell but cannot.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage risk</strong>: Margin loans (e.g., from a brokerage account) are extremely risky. A market downturn can lead to margin calls or even negative equity (e.g., stocks drop to $800k, but you borrowed $1 million, owing $200k). Personal loans (with stable income, used for investment) are relatively manageable because they are not directly tied to stock market value for forced liquidation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The essence of learning</strong>: It&rsquo;s not just about learning what works, but more importantly, learning that &ldquo;these things are useless&rdquo; (like technical analysis, economic analysis, business cycle indicators). This conclusion is reached after understanding these tools.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Observed some people nearing retirement with no stable income wanting to borrow money to invest. However, their understanding of investment philosophy and risk tolerance might be insufficient. Advised such individuals not to borrow easily; they should first build a solid foundation with their own funds and become mentally strong enough before considering advanced operations.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: Strongly agree. Investors first need to experience market volatility (e.g., a 10-15% correction) with their own funds to confirm they can tolerate it before considering borrowing. For retirees:
<ul>
<li>Personal loans: If there&rsquo;s no stable income for repayment, a market downturn will force selling stocks to repay debt, which is not recommended.</li>
<li>Mortgages: A home equity line of credit (HELOC, interest-only payments, like in the US) might be considered; however, mortgages requiring principal and interest payments are not recommended due to the large amounts involved.</li>
<li>Core principle: For any leveraged investment, consider, &ldquo;If the stock drops to zero, the loan still needs to be repaid. Can I handle it?&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: As a listener for over two years, he gradually shifted personal funds, private equity, trusts, and insurance products into QQQ and domestic Nasdaq ETFs. Due to excessive optimism, he used margin (brokerage account overdraft to buy) from late 2023 to early 2024, almost at 1:1 leverage. He then encountered the &ldquo;tariff war&rdquo; and liquidity issues in the domestic ETF market (e.g., 513100), where some ETFs hit their limit down and couldn&rsquo;t be sold. He was forced to significantly deleverage the next day, wiping out much of the previous year&rsquo;s profits. His father&rsquo;s account, with no leverage and regular investments, hit an all-time high. Profound realization: Don&rsquo;t rush to make money; slow is fast, and safety is more important. Personal cash flow and future income expectations are crucial when using leverage. Also, in panic, he cleared out QLD from his Hong Kong account, missing the subsequent rally. This experience reminded him of the 2015 A-share market crash, also involving margin calls and being unable to sell for three consecutive days.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: Sams&rsquo; experience is very typical. Markets have liquidity risks, and margin risks are enormous, potentially leading to margin calls or even owing the brokerage money. Repeatedly emphasized the importance of the &ldquo;market goes to zero test.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t test human nature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Investing allows one to control their own destiny. He experienced his company being acquired, then another company he co-founded being acquired (sold to Evergrande, which later defaulted, and got entangled in lawsuits), and personally shutting down an underperforming branch (decided to close the Chongqing branch after a three-hour walk with his boss; employees were given N+1 severance the next day). Because he had investments as a backup, he was more composed when facing these changes. Colleagues without investments (like some branch managers) felt lost about their future. Insight: Whether in good times or bad, hold on to good assets.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: All things have unexpected events (companies go bankrupt, properties get damaged). When investing, first think about risk. Jobs and individual stocks carry high risks. QQQ will also drop significantly. Only invest money you won&rsquo;t need for 15-20-30 years. Retirees need to set aside about 15 years of cash for living expenses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: Mr. James once suggested 70% QQQ / 30% cash, and allocating 2% to leveraged funds (like QLD) in down years. He wanted to confirm:
<ol>
<li>Can mainland China and Hong Kong accounts be treated as one, with a synchronized 70/30 allocation?</li>
<li>Since transferring funds out of mainland China is troublesome, should more leveraged funds be allocated in Hong Kong?</li>
<li>If the market falls at year-end, is the 2% allocation to leveraged funds based on 2% of total assets or only 2% of Hong Kong assets?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s reply:
<ol>
<li>For beginners or those sensitive to volatility, 70/30 (QQQ/cash) or even 60/40 is a safe starting point. No need to rush into leveraged funds. Because even if the overall drop isn&rsquo;t large, the violent fluctuations of leveraged funds themselves can cause anxiety (e.g., only focusing on QLD dropping 5%, not seeing that cash doesn&rsquo;t drop).</li>
<li>Beta can start at a lower level (e.g., 0.6-0.8) and gradually increase with experience and asset growth.</li>
<li>Regarding the 2% QLD allocation: It can be calculated based on Hong Kong assets or total assets. However, note that leveraged funds usually cannot be used as collateral for bank loans (e.g., at HSBC). If QLD proportion is too high, it might affect future collateralized financing plans.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Listening to Mr. James&rsquo;s class is like learning life philosophy; investing is a battle against human nature. Experienced the recent market correction (what the teacher called a &ldquo;slap in the face&rdquo; market). Although he wanted to hold on, he was scared and sold half of his holdings, including some individual stocks like Nvidia.</li>
<li>Question: His Roth IRA account is small, and he&rsquo;s nearing retirement. He wants to know if an allocation of 60% QQQ + 10% TQQQ + 30% cash, or 70% QQQ + 20% TQQQ + 10% cash, resulting in an overall Beta of around 0.8, is robust enough while also providing growth.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s reply: A 60/10/30 (QQQ/TQQQ/cash) configuration, with a Beta around 0.8, is very good. Beta will increase as the leveraged portion grows. For those afraid of volatility, an initial Beta of 0.6-0.8 is sufficient.</li>

Investing slowly and waiting for the compounding effect is a good choice.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: Slow is fast. Don&rsquo;t use money you need to earn money you don&rsquo;t need. Life should be about reducing regrets, not chasing empty fame and fortune.

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Introduced to Mr. James&rsquo;s philosophy by a friend in 2018/2019. As a stock market novice, he was deeply inspired and immediately adjusted his strategy, investing borrowed funds and continuing with regular contributions. He once participated in short-term trading studies (joined a stock reading club) but found it arduous and the ROE (Return on Equity) not high. He had to watch the market daily, research US stocks, Taiwan stocks, margin changes, aiming for a 10-20% annualized return, and only dared to invest a portion of his capital (e.g., 10-30%). So he gave up, focused on his main job and long-term investing, and now lives a peaceful and prosperous life (meditating morning and evening). When sharing his philosophy with friends and colleagues, he found they hesitated to invest for their own long-term (feeling 20-30 years is too long), but were more receptive to investing for their children, which might then lead them to participate themselves. Having experienced 00662 (a Taiwanese Nasdaq 100 ETF) dropping from over 50 to the 40s and persisting in buying, he is now calm about current market fluctuations.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: Many short-term traders only look at the ROI (Return on Investment) of individual trades, ignoring the ROE (Return on Equity) on their total assets. They might achieve a high ROI with a small amount of capital, but it contributes little to overall wealth growth. For example, with 1 million in capital, using 30,000 to make 30,000 is a 100% ROI, but only a 3% ROE. Whereas we aim for a 10% return on the entire 1 million, which is 100,000.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Noticed Mr. James recently emphasizing conservatism more, suggesting a 30% cash position (earlier it was 10-20%). Is this due to varying student experience levels or other considerations? He himself targets a Beta of 1.0, holds leveraged funds, has little cash, and would need to reduce leveraged funds to reach 30% cash.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s reply: Yes, this is because students come from diverse backgrounds; many are novices or cannot withstand significant volatility. A 30% (or even 40%) cash position is a &ldquo;plain beef noodle soup&rdquo; style basic version, suitable for everyone to start with. Experienced investors who can tolerate risk can adjust it themselves, choosing a &ldquo;mildly spicy&rdquo; or &ldquo;extra spicy&rdquo; allocation. Asset allocation is very personal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Regarding wealth inheritance. Warren Buffett&rsquo;s testamentary portfolio (90% S&amp;P 500 + 10% short-term bonds) is suitable due to his vast assets. For ordinary people whose descendants have no interest in investing, how should a &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; trust asset allocation plan be established? (Citing Anita Mui&rsquo;s trust case)
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s reply:
<ul>
<li>Firstly, children&rsquo;s moral character and values education (quoting Lin Zexu: &ldquo;If my descendants are like me, what&rsquo;s the use of leaving them money? If my descendants are not like me, what&rsquo;s the use of leaving them money?&rdquo;) is more important than wealth inheritance. Wealth should be the icing on the cake.</li>
<li>One can start considering gifting when their assets exceed 50 times their annual expenses.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not advisable to easily set up a private non-profit foundation unless the children are genuinely committed, otherwise, it might become a burden or a management problem.</li>
<li>Trust selection: Trust services from large financial institutions (like HSBC, Charles Schwab) are generally more stable than private family offices (even if the institution fails, assets are protected, like Credit Suisse being taken over by UBS), but offer less flexibility. One can set up a portfolio like 70% QQQ / 30% cash (or short-term bonds/money market funds), with a rule to withdraw 2% annually, achieving perpetuity. The key is simplicity and low management fees. Private family offices might offer comprehensive services, but institutional trusts focus more on asset management and distribution.</li>

<p>Market fluctuations have nothing to do with me anymore. The market might be full of turmoil, tariffs coming and going, wars still ongoing, but the market is already close to new highs. So this is why you don&rsquo;t need to care about market signals; they are not important, not important at all.

<p>Earning money through physical labor will never keep up with inflation, let alone the speed of asset appreciation.
&ndash; Mr. James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view highlights the fundamental difference between labor income and capital appreciation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you calculate falling in love, getting married, and having children in terms of cost, then you&rsquo;re being too meticulous&hellip; We are rich people; money is meant to be spent. We&rsquo;ll have more money than we can spend in a lifetime, so if we get married and have children, let&rsquo;s have a few more to spend it together.

<blockquote>
<p>Slowly is fast. You will all become a big tree for your family.
&ndash; Mr. James (combining the &ldquo;slow is fast&rdquo; and &ldquo;become a big tree&rdquo; concepts)</p></blockquote>
<p>This view encourages long-term patient investing, believing in the power of compounding to enable individuals to become the economic pillars of their families.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For any asset allocation, just ask yourself: what if the market goes to zero tomorrow, how would you fare? Ah, if you find out it&rsquo;s not okay, if I&rsquo;m finished if it goes to zero, then you should quickly adjust your asset allocation.
&ndash; Mr. James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view provides an ultimate test for measuring risk tolerance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone needs to know that in investing, all things can have unexpected outcomes. Your company can go bankrupt in an instant&hellip; So for any investment, the first thing to think about is what if this investment is destroyed, goes to zero, what will you do?

<p>This view emphasizes risk awareness, that any investment should first consider the worst-case scenario.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think about making this money too quickly; a bit slower and safer might be better.

<p>Sams, after a severe setback with leverage, gained a profound understanding of prudent investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s the biggest advantage of investing well? It&rsquo;s that you can control your own destiny.
&ndash; Sams</p></blockquote>
<p>Sams shared how investing gave him more agency and security amidst career and life changes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spending five minutes a year is enough. There&rsquo;s absolutely no need to care about market fluctuations; it&rsquo;s completely meaningless&hellip; Living a good life is the purpose of life.

<p>In this CLEC sharing session, Mr. James once again emphasized the importance of long-term holding of quality assets (especially the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund) and reminded investors to ignore market noise and focus on their own investment discipline. He deeply analyzed the operational mechanisms of capitalism, pointing out that ordinary people can achieve wealth growth through capital markets and escape the &ldquo;laborer mindset.&rdquo; The discussion covered several important topics, including risk management (especially a cautious attitude towards using leverage, advising most to start with a conservative cash ratio, and conducting the &ldquo;market goes to zero&rdquo; test), the wisdom of wealth inheritance (emphasizing children&rsquo;s moral education first and suggesting simple, sustainable trust solutions through financial institutions), elderly care for parents (prioritizing health management over financial worries), and balancing investment with life happiness (avoiding excessive calculation of &ldquo;costs&rdquo; in life, living in the present, and achieving the state of &ldquo;Die with Zero&rdquo;). Participants&rsquo; sharing also provided valuable practical experiences and lessons, particularly regarding leverage risks, market liquidity, and the profound impact of investment on personal control over one&rsquo;s destiny. Overall, this session aimed to help investors establish the correct investment mindset and methodology to achieve long-term financial health and a fulfilling life.</p>

<p>The core viewpoint of this episode emphasizes that investment decisions should be <strong>independent of market volatility</strong>, with <strong>sufficient cash reserves</strong> serving as the first step and cornerstone of investment planning. After determining the cash level based on individual risk tolerance and living needs, then proceed with long-term (15+ years) investment in index funds (especially the Nasdaq 100). Beta is a result of asset allocation, not the starting point. At the same time, be wary of various risks in investment, especially cognitive risks and behavioral biases, and remain vigilant about conflicts of interest in financial services.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on Doing the Right Things:</strong> The core is &ldquo;Han Xin Counts Soldiers&rdquo; (i.e., using affordable and safe borrowing, such as mortgages and credit lines, for investment), putting borrowed money into the market, but with sufficient cash reserves.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Targets:</strong> Only invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (such as QQQ, 00662, 513100, etc.), as it represents human growth and innovation and has a self-evolving mechanism of survival of the fittest. Related materials are linked on page 10 of the handout. It is mentioned that HXQ and other Nasdaq 100-based funds may outperform QQQ in certain periods.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Holding:</strong> Holding for 15+ years after purchase is key, &ldquo;never selling.&rdquo; Only inaction can lead to wealth, not frequent trading.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Optimistic:</strong> Investment is based on confidence in the long-term development of humanity.</li>
<li><strong>Independent Learning:</strong> Investment requires self-study, understanding the reasons behind the strategy and the then-current market environment, and not blindly following.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Question:</strong> The first step in investing is not what to buy, but <strong>how much cash needs to be retained</strong> to live securely and cope with emergencies. This is the most important thing.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Needs Determine Allocation:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Young People:</strong> First, prepare an emergency fund (e.g., NT$400,000/CNY100,000), and only invest surplus funds.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation Model Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>433 (Beta 1.0):</strong> 40% Index + 30% Leverage + 30% Cash. Requires 30% Cash &gt; Emergency Fund (e.g., NT$400,000), requiring total assets of NT$1.33 million to implement.</li>
<li><strong>424 (Beta 0.8):</strong> 40% Index + 20% Leverage + 40% Cash. Requires 40% Cash &gt; Emergency Fund (e.g., NT$400,000), requiring total assets of NT$1 million to implement. Illustrates that reducing Beta can lower the funding threshold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>High-Net-Worth Individuals:</strong> The principle is the same, determine the cash ratio according to personal comfort (potentially millions of RMB or hundreds of thousands of USD).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Beta is the Result, Not the Goal:</strong> First determine cash needs and risk tolerance, naturally forming the allocation ratio, and finally calculate the Beta value as a measurement tool. Don&rsquo;t set a target Beta from the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Allocation Irrelevant Factors:</strong> Asset allocation is <strong>unrelated</strong> to age, fund size, or market level, only related to how to prevent accidents and how much accident can be tolerated.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Tolerance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Young people have less experience, so risk tolerance may not be high, and should not blindly pursue high Beta (e.g., 442).</li>
<li>Wealthy people are usually more conservative, pursuing stability rather than extreme returns (Beta 0.5 may be sufficient).</li>
<li>Conclusion: Taking risks beyond your tolerance is foolish. Investment is like eating spicy food, do what you can handle.</li>
<li>Recommendation: Start conservatively. If you believe you can tolerate Beta 1.2, start with 1.0; if you believe you can tolerate 1.0, start with 0.8.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Leveraged Fund Usage Principles:</strong> The ratio of leveraged funds should not exceed the ratio of cash or the ratio of the original fund. This suggests that a 442 allocation (40% Index + 40% Leverage + 20% Cash) is not suitable for most people.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral Biases:</strong> Retail investors often feel sad when the market falls (regret buying early) and also sad when the market rises (regret not going all-in). The correct allocation should achieve &ldquo;happy when it rises, comfortable when it falls,&rdquo; maintaining &ldquo;immovability.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Individual Stock Risk:</strong> No company lasts forever (examples: Intel, Kodak, Blackberry), individual stock risk is high. Index funds mitigate individual stock risk through a mechanism of survival of the fittest.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing Risk:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safe Borrowing:</strong> Mortgages, credit lines (Han Xin Counts Soldiers), assuming income can cover monthly payments, unrelated to market fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Dangerous Borrowing:</strong> Margin trading, stock-pledged reinvestment. Market declines can lead to forced liquidation or even bankruptcy. <strong>These operations are strictly prohibited.</strong></li>
<li>James&rsquo;s pledge loan: Based on holding cash far exceeding debt, ensuring absolute security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Specific Funds Use Risk:</strong> Money earmarked for short-term use (e.g., down payment on a house) within a short period (e.g., 3 years) <strong>absolutely cannot</strong> be invested in the stock market. Someone recently defaulted because of this.</li>
<li><strong>Tax Risk:</strong> Tax planning is very important and can affect significant wealth. Rules need to be carefully studied (e.g., the application of the U.S. Wash Sale Rule across accounts).</li>
<li><strong>Spending Ability Mindset:</strong> True &ldquo;affordability&rdquo; means being able to easily repurchase an item if it breaks down, as in James&rsquo;s example of replacing a juicer. Large expenditures (e.g., buying a house) should also have this mindset, otherwise the risk is too high.</li>

<li>Sharing:
<ol>
<li>Observed that regardless of wealth, some people are keen on short-term trading, possibly due to addictive pleasure or a sense of accomplishment. Poor people may say they need quick returns, while rich people may enjoy the process.</li>
<li>Emphasized the strict prohibition of margin trading or stock-pledged reinvestment. Recently, with the market decline, someone was forced to liquidate and even became indebted because of it. Compared this to his own use of credit lines/mortgages for investment, stating that as long as he can afford the monthly payments, the market decline does not affect his survival.</li>
<li>Mentioned a senior who was forced to liquidate due to margin calls during the Kuo Wan-Jung incident (Taiwan stock market historical event) and has been in debt ever since, warning future generations.</li>
<li><strong>Important Reminder:</strong> When observing an investment portfolio, you should pay attention to the <strong>fluctuation range of the overall assets</strong> rather than just staring at the leveraged portion with the biggest decline, which helps manage emotions.</li>

<li>Has reached the retirement goal (50x annual expenses), but his current salary is equivalent to 6% of total assets.

Between 433 (30% cash + 2% withdrawal) and 442 (20% cash + no withdrawal), how to further think about the choice from the perspective of safety and applicability?</li>
<li>(Implicit question) Should he continue working for a sense of accomplishment, or retire early?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Regarding Purchasing the Car:</strong> Praised his use of &ldquo;non-own funds&rdquo; for consumption, pointing out that being able to borrow money is itself a manifestation of wealth, the key is controllable risk (sufficient cash).</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Retirement Choices:</strong> This is a classic question. Cited another case to illustrate that early retirement may bring huge benefits due to tax planning (such as Roth conversions). Suggested that Rui reflect: if work had no salary or recognition, would he still want to go? The value of work may change with stage, and there may be new pursuits in the future. Looking back from age 90, would he regret working several more decades? With financial freedom, the work mentality can be more relaxed.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding 433 vs 442 Safety:</strong> Assuming the market goes to zero, which is safer? The answer is the one with a higher cash ratio (433 has 30% cash, 442 has only 20%).</li>

<li>Question: Regarding whether the interest on the U.S. Pledged Asset Line (PAL, pledge loan) can be tax-deductible, and how to operate? Feels that the rules are complex and there are many restrictions.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: The money borrowed from PAL is mainly used for consumption, not reinvestment. The issue of interest tax deduction is complicated and may require adjusting the type of capital gains (e.g., converting long-term to short-term), relying on accountant operations. James himself does not pay attention to this operation because his strategy is to hold a lot of cash, making interest income far exceed PAL interest expenses, and PAL interest is close to zero. The more fundamental strategy is to achieve &ldquo;zero income, zero capital gains,&rdquo; so there is no need to consider tax deduction.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Revealed an American tax trap: the Wash Sale Rule may apply to all accounts (including 401k/IRA and other retirement accounts). If you sell a loss-making asset (such as QQQ) in a taxable account for Tax Loss Harvesting (TLH) and automatically buy a similar asset (such as an SP500 index fund) in a retirement account at the same time, the loss in the taxable account may be permanently disallowed (because retirement accounts are taxed at ordinary income rates when withdrawn, with no capital gains concept). This is especially important for high-tech employees, as they often hold a large number of RSUs and perform TLH.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: Tax issues are extremely important. Pointed out that TLH itself also has risks, such as the market rebounding after selling, making it impossible to buy back the original asset (QQQ) at an ideal price, or generating new capital gains when buying back. If James himself has no need (such as no capital gains without selling stocks), he tends to let the loss carry forward and deduct $3,000 of ordinary income each year, rather than use it to offset capital gains. However, for Julia, who needs to offset a large amount of RSU capital gains, TLH is a reasonable strategy and needs to be operated carefully. Discussed the problem of high tax rates in California. Re-emphasized the ultimate goal of pursuing a zero-tax state, and the value of tax planning far exceeds the salary itself.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: Asked about the risk of the Pacific War two years ago, at that time the teacher suggested reducing 50% of QQQ. Now that he has adopted the strategy of holding a large amount of cash (such as 433/424), can he withstand this type of risk, insist on holding it and rebalancing at the end of the year, without selling in the middle?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: The evolution of the strategy is because the introduction of leveraged instruments allows holding a large amount of cash more effectively. The core risk management issue is not specific events (wars, disasters, etc.), but <strong>whether it is possible to survive in extreme market conditions (such as closure/deep decline for 10-15 years)</strong>. If cash reserves are sufficient to support such a long time, there is no need to make predictive operations for specific events. Comparing risks: for young people, the risk of carrying a mortgage and facing unemployment + market decline may be more realistic and fatal than the risk of war. Buying a house should be as easy and stress-free as buying slippers to be considered affordable.</li>

<li>Sharing: Summarized two major investment risks:
<ol>
<li><strong>Choosing the wrong asset:</strong> The market is full of various temptations, choosing a high-quality asset for the long term (such as QQQ) is the foundation. Thanks to the teacher for continuing to emphasize this.</li>
<li><strong>Missing the upside:</strong> Statistics show that missing the 10 days with the biggest market gains (in the past 20 years) will cut total returns in half. These big rally days often occur during periods of extreme panic (such as 2008, 2020). This confirms the importance of the &ldquo;never sell&rdquo; strategy to avoid timing the market.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: Highly Agreed. Defined <strong>the real, permanent loss</strong> as <strong>the returns that should have been earned but were not</strong> (such as missing a 12% rally). Book losses caused by market declines are temporary and will recover. Compared buying QQQ at a high point (540) with buying at a low point (440), the difference in annualized returns after holding for 40 years is extremely small (11.98% vs 12.5%), indicating that the timing of the purchase is not important, but long-term holding is key. Use a long-term perspective (40 years later) to review current decisions.</li>

<li>Question: Approaching retirement, but savings have not reached the 30-50x target. There is a stable high income in the next 5 years, and Pension/Social Security will cover most expenses after retirement. Does not use pledging due to concerns about risk. Can I not retain 20% cash and take a 100% stock holding strategy, relying on future income, emergency fund, and future pledgeable options to accelerate asset growth?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: <strong>No.</strong> Risk tolerance decreases as retirement approaches, the time window is short, and you should be more conservative. Since the Pension already covers most of the expenses, the urgency for asset growth should be reduced. <strong>The most aggressive allocation for retirement or near retirement, without using pledges and without holding leveraged funds, is 80% QQQ + 20% cash.</strong> Pension should be regarded as a stable source of income, and when calculating the total amount of retirement funds required, the <strong>Pension portion should be deducted</strong> from annual expenses first, and then the remaining net expenditure needs should be multiplied by a multiple (such as 30 or 50 times). If you hold leveraged funds, you must sell them and deal with tax issues before retirement.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The first step in investing is not to say, ah, I come in and start, what should the teacher buy, how much leveraged funds should I buy&hellip; No&hellip; The first thing to invest in is how much cash you need, how much cash you need to keep, this is more important than anything.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Emphasizes the primacy of cash reserves in investment planning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our strategy has nothing to do with market volatility&hellip; What are investment plans or investments supposed to do? It is to be based on your own risk tolerance&hellip; How much cash is appropriate to keep, this is the first step in investing.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Explains the core concept of his investment strategy, which is not affected by short-term market sentiment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beta is naturally formed in the end, not set at the beginning&hellip; So you have to ask the first few questions, how much cash do you keep to feel comfortable&hellip; An accident may come in the next second.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Explains the role of Beta in asset allocation, which is a result, not a goal, emphasizing safety first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Young people should not take risks, because they lack experience, and rich people do not take risks much&hellip; Coming back to the point, taking risks is not very worthwhile, taking risks beyond what you can afford is just very stupid.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Refutes traditional concepts, pointing out that excessive risk-taking is not advisable, regardless of whether you are young or wealthy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t turn your tactics into a strategy&hellip; It seems that the emergency fund should have been so much, but you, ah, it&rsquo;s dropped so much, quickly buy it all in. That turns tactics into a strategy, you can&rsquo;t do that.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When commenting on student sharing, distinguishes the boundaries between strategic determination and tactical flexibility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What you should look at is not your single stock (referring to leveraged ETFs)&hellip; Drops a lot, you should look at the range of fluctuations in your entire asset&hellip; Don&rsquo;t pay too much attention to the part that is dropping the most.
&ndash; CAD (Student)</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Reminds that when holding leveraged ETFs, you should pay attention to the volatility of the overall investment portfolio rather than a single product, to stabilize your mentality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the real risk of the market? The real risk of the market is your investment return, the real risk is the returns that you should have earned but didn&rsquo;t, that you will never earn&hellip; A drop in losses is not a loss.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Redefines investment risk, emphasizing that opportunity cost (missing the upside) is the real permanent loss.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The risk of buying a house is higher than the risk of war&hellip; If you treat buying a house like buying slippers, then you can buy a house.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Responding to questions about geopolitical risks, compared and pointed out that for ordinary people, financial leverage (such as mortgages) may bring more direct and serious risks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t manage your finances and taxes well, you may pay 85% of your assets in taxes in this life, and you actually only get 15%&hellip; Saving taxes can save tens of billions.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When discussing tax planning, emphasizes its huge impact on long-term wealth accumulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because being poor is also right to do speculation&hellip; So it&rsquo;s also right that most people who speculate are poor&hellip; Many people who speculate don&rsquo;t even know it, they don&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know, which is very strange.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When discussing speculative psychology with his daughter, reflected on the relationship between poverty and greed, and that speculators often lack self-awareness.</p>

<p>This lecture once again consolidates James&rsquo;s core investment philosophy: <strong>taking sufficient cash reserves as a prerequisite for ultra-long-term (15+ years) holding of the Nasdaq 100 index fund.</strong> It emphasizes the priority of risk management, especially determining the cash ratio based on individual circumstances and building asset allocation based on this, rather than pursuing a specific Beta value or being driven by market sentiment. The differences in risk perception at different life stages and wealth levels were discussed, and the use of high-risk leverage (such as margin trading) for investment was strongly opposed. In addition, practical advice and warnings were shared on tax planning, retirement preparation, financial service selection, and consumption mentality. The Q&amp;A session delved into the specific problems encountered by students in practice, further clarifying strategy details and risk considerations, such as retirement fund calculation, the view on global diversification, and psychological management techniques (focus on overall portfolio rather than local volatility). Overall, this content revolves around the two words <strong>&ldquo;determination&rdquo;</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;safety,&rdquo;</strong> that is, maintaining strategic determination and financial security in a volatile market, and adhering to the correct principles.</p>

<p>This episode mainly discusses how to conduct reasonable asset allocation in the event of market fluctuations. The core idea is: <strong>Invest in the US Nasdaq Index Fund, hold it for the long term, ignore short-term market fluctuations, manage risks well, and adjust the asset allocation ratio according to your own circumstances.</strong> The core lies in establishing an investment mindset that is &ldquo;independent&rdquo; of market fluctuations, with the focus on asset allocation and risk tolerance that suit you.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concentration of Funds:</strong> Concentrate all investable funds into one account to avoid difficulty in grasping the overall asset situation due to scattered accounts. This includes bank deposits, stocks, funds, etc. James emphasizes that you should thoroughly count your assets like &ldquo;counting soldiers painstakingly,&rdquo; so that you know your situation well.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing for Investment:</strong> Actively use tools such as credit and mortgage-linked wealth management loans to use the borrowed funds for investment, and do not let the funds sit idle in the bank &ldquo;blowing cold air.&rdquo; The interest rates on credit and mortgage-linked wealth management loans are usually lower than the yield of US 00864B, so borrowing to invest can generate interest spread. Note:
<ul>
<li><strong>Restrictions on Stock-Pledged Loans:</strong> Should not be used directly for large-scale reinvestment, but can be used in small amounts (e.g., 2%) to supplement funds for &ldquo;beautiful (daily) transfers.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Assess Repayment Ability:</strong> Ensure that monthly available salary is stable for repayment to avoid excessive borrowing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> Include all investable funds (including borrowed funds) in the total assets for unified allocation. This provides a more comprehensive perspective for managing risk and optimizing returns.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Office Workers:</strong> It is recommended to adopt an asset allocation ratio of 442 or 433. These ratios represent a balance between risk and return, and are suitable for investors with different risk preferences. Among them:
<ul>
<li>442: 40% Index Fund (e.g., QQQ), 40% Leveraged Fund (e.g., QLD), 20% Cash. Suitable for investors with higher risk tolerance.</li>
<li>433 Beta 1.0: 40% Index Fund (e.g., QQQ), 30% Leveraged Fund (Beta 1.0, leveraged fund with lower volatility), 30% Cash. Suitable for investors seeking steady returns.</li>
<li>You can also choose a more conservative configuration of Beta 0.8 or Beta 0.5 to reduce volatility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Do it All at Once:</strong> Asset allocation should be done in one step, without procrastination, to avoid hesitation due to market fluctuations. Execute immediately and don&rsquo;t let &ldquo;hesitation&rdquo; become a stumbling block for investment.</li>
<li><strong>Annual Rebalancing:</strong> Conduct passive rebalancing once a year, instead of actively operating according to market fluctuations. Specific methods:
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Rises:</strong> Transfer one-third of the increased value of the leveraged fund to cash to lock in some profits and reduce portfolio risk.</li>
<li><strong>Market Falls:</strong> Take 2% of total assets from cash and invest in leveraged funds to increase investment during market downturns.</li>
<li><strong>Total Asset Benchmark:</strong> The benchmark for rebalancing is the initially set total asset amount, not the later increased amount, unless the asset allocation is re-evaluated and adjusted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ignore Market Fluctuations:</strong> All investment decisions are independent of market fluctuations, and adhere to a long-term investment strategy. Don&rsquo;t panic because the market is falling, and don&rsquo;t be greedy because the market is rising. James emphasizes that our investment &ldquo;ignores&rdquo; the existence of the market. No matter how the market fluctuates, we adhere to the established asset allocation plan.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Control:</strong> The only controllable risk is raising the cash position. Other systematic risks (such as war, economic crisis, etc.) cannot be controlled. Trying to control systematic risks is futile. Even Buffett can only cope by increasing cash reserves.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Tolerance:</strong> Test your own risk tolerance through market declines, and choose the Beta value that suits you. Market declines are the best time to test whether asset allocation is reasonable, and also a great opportunity to understand your own risk tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>Beta Value Selection:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Beta 1.2: High volatility, suitable for investors with high risk tolerance.</li>
<li>Beta 1.0: Moderate volatility.</li>
<li>Beta 0.8 or lower: Low volatility, suitable for investors with low risk tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>Drop Two Levels:</strong> If you feel too much pressure during a market downturn, it is recommended to drop two levels on the Beta value that you currently think is safe to ensure a more comfortable investment experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Chasing Highs and Selling Lows:</strong> After determining the Beta value, do not change it frequently to avoid chasing highs and selling lows. Frequent changes in the Beta value will lead to confusion in the investment strategy, which may eventually outweigh the benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> Regardless of the asset allocation adopted, the cash ratio should be maintained at 20% or higher. This provides a sufficient safety buffer to cope with emergencies.</li>

<li>It is recommended that everyone switch other individual stocks to the index funds recommended by the teacher when the decline is large. Provides practical advice for other investors.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Question: When withdrawing 2% of 50 times the annual spending, is inflation considered, and will the withdrawal ratio be increased due to inflation?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Inflation will not significantly increase the cost of living in the short term. If you feel pressure after five years, you can re-evaluate your assets and increase the withdrawal amount, but the maximum is 2% of the adjusted assets.

<li>Question: Some banks in Taiwan provide mortgage-linked wealth management loans that can be used cyclically for people under 75 years old. There are still 30 years left for 45 years old. Is there a better way to use this?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Borrow all the money you can borrow. As long as you persist long enough and are not affected by market fluctuations, investment cannot lose money for more than 15 years. It is recommended to assess your tolerance when the market falls by 20% before deciding on the loan amount. James emphasizes confidence in long-term investment and the importance of assessing risks.</li>

<li>Question:
<ol>
<li>401K company match, so 401K can transfer to traditional IRO. But if you want to earn ROS, you must be in a situation where the tax rate is very low, and there is no way to directly save. Is the logic correct that you can only transfer to rus to invest from there after we both retire?</li>
<li>If we just sell our cash property houses and cash, and then directly deposit that investment, is that right?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Try to allocate your 401K as much as possible and allocate it to R. Because the company&rsquo;s Dr has nothing to do with income. Whether you want to transfer your old traditional to R401K depends on your tax rate. Give you a number and calculate it with you now. You should convert how much each year. James emphasizes that you can determine whether to convert based on the calculation. Based on the current volume of 800,000 US dollars, if it is covered with an annualized return of 12% in 15 years, you need to convert 100,000 US dollars each year. If you retire five years later and use 220,000 US dollars for tax filing, the tax rate will be higher. You should retire early to do the convert.</li>
<li>You can put it in brokerage. You can just put it directly, right? It is still worth putting it. James suggests starting investing as soon as possible and not letting cash sit idle.</li>

<li>Sharing: Joined CLEC in September 2023. I am very grateful to the teacher for opening up my financial quotient. The 433 configuration has been completed, and I don’t feel anything about this wave of decline because I can do pledge and credit.

<li>Question: Mortgage-linked wealth management loans can be used to borrow new ones to repay old ones. 75 years old can continue to borrow cyclically. 45 years old still has 30 years. Is there a better way to use this? With 33 times the annual spending in assets, can selling rental houses to achieve 40 times allow you to stop working? A two-times leveraged QQQ in Canada has a small scale. Is it safe?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>You should just go and borrow it without hesitation, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t want me to repay it, or ask me to repay it after 40 years. As long as you invest for more than 15 years, you cannot lose money, so 30 years is guaranteed to have at least a 9% return, so there is no problem. The key is that you have to persist long enough and not be affected by market fluctuations, which is more important. How will you feel if the market you borrow from this mortgage-linked wealth management loan falls by 20% from today? Just ask yourself. If you are okay, then it is okay.</li>
<li>Living off 2-3% of your current QQQ and SPY (75% and 25%) is better than selling the rental house.</li>
<li>The safety of the ETF has nothing to do with its volume. As long as you can buy and sell it, it&rsquo;s fine.</li>

<p>The core of this investment philosophy is to establish an investment mindset that is &ldquo;independent&rdquo; of market fluctuations, avoiding investment decisions from being affected by market ups and downs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We ignore the existence of the market from beginning to end.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasizes a long-term investment strategy, do not try to predict the market, but adhere to the established asset allocation plan.</p>

<p>Encourages everyone to actively pursue financial freedom, get rid of working for money, and realize their dreams.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems that we have bought a lottery ticket for an amusement park. We come in with the entrance ticket and experience all the happiness inside, instead of repairing the machine there.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Encourages everyone to actively experience life and not miss opportunities because they are afraid of risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you borrow 10 million, then your cash position is 433, you will become one level lower. You don’t have to be 433. You can also be 523.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasizes the flexibility of asset allocation, which can be adjusted according to the actual situation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the market rebounds and comes up, maybe next week there is a chance for everyone to adjust the beta. At that time, the market rises, then you quickly lower the leveraged fund, or raise the cash, that&rsquo;s it.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is right to lower the beta when the market rebounds and rises. When the market falls, lowering it is to sell low.</p>

<p>Life is short, be brave to try and don&rsquo;t miss the opportunity to experience life because you are afraid of risk.</p>

<p>Stable growth is more important than you can&rsquo;t stand it.
