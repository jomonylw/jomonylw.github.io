<p>This book reveals a financial secret that everyone can learn but is rarely taught in school: <strong>You don&rsquo;t have to be a finance expert or a high-income earner to achieve financial freedom; prudent spending and rational investing are all it takes, even on a modest income.</strong></p>
<p>The author, Andrew Hallam, is a high school English teacher who started investing at age 19 and became a millionaire by age 38. He distilled his years of investment experience and wisdom he garnered from numerous financial wizards into nine simple and actionable principles. Supported by factual cases and personal anecdotes, he guides readers step-by-step towards financial freedom.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distinguish between &ldquo;wants&rdquo; and &ldquo;needs&rdquo;</strong>: Spend rationally, control unnecessary expenses, and avoid over-reliance on credit cards. Invest the money you save.
<ul>
<li>Example: In his youth, the author lived an extremely frugal life to pay off his student loans as quickly as possible, succeeding within a year and subsequently investing all his income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How to buy a car for less</strong>: Opt for low-mileage, easy-to-resell used cars instead of blindly pursuing luxury vehicles.
<ul>
<li>Example: The author purchased low-mileage used Japanese cars in his youth and sold them for the same or even higher price after a few years, turning a small profit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Buying a house: It&rsquo;s not about the down payment, but the interest rate</strong>:  Consider whether you can still afford the mortgage if the interest rate doubles to prevent financial strain due to rising rates.</li>
<li><strong>Start strong, don&rsquo;t rely on a &ldquo;rich dad&rdquo;</strong>:  Excessive financial support from parents can hinder a child&rsquo;s ability to create wealth independently. Teach them financial knowledge and skills, letting them learn how to earn, save, and invest on their own.
<ul>
<li>Example: Studies show that accountants who received financial assistance from their parents had 43% less average wealth than their self-made counterparts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>You don&rsquo;t have to live like a pauper, but spend like a millionaire</strong>: Frugality does not equate to a lower quality of life. It&rsquo;s about investing the money you save, allowing it to work for you instead of the other way around.</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leverage compound interest to accelerate wealth accumulation</strong>: The earlier you start investing, the longer the time horizon for compound interest to work its magic, leading to faster wealth growth.
<ul>
<li>Example: Investing $45 per month for 40 years yields significantly higher returns than investing $800 per month for only 25 years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Buffett&rsquo;s &ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark Principle&rdquo;</strong>: Invest early, just like Noah built the ark, don&rsquo;t wait for the &ldquo;flood&rdquo; to arrive before taking action.</li>
<li><strong>What to do when you get paid</strong>:  Keep track of your monthly expenses, calculate the amount available for investment, and transfer that money to your investment account on payday to avoid running out of funds at the end of the month.
<ul>
<li>Example: A couple the author knew, both teachers, realized their wasteful spending habits after tracking their expenses for three months. They subsequently allocated more money to investment, tripling their investment amount within two years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The stock market doesn&rsquo;t believe in tears, but it believes in time</strong>:  In the long run, the stock market rises with corporate earnings growth. Therefore, be patient and don&rsquo;t be intimidated by short-term market fluctuations. The author&rsquo;s stock market investments from 1990 had increased tenfold by 2016.
<ul>
<li>Example: Using Willy Wonka&rsquo;s chocolate factory as an analogy, the author explains the fundamentals of stocks, share prices, dividends, and the stock market in a simple and engaging way, highlighting the substantial returns from long-term investment.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Index funds: the secret to effortless wealth generation</strong>: Index funds track a specific market index, holding all or most of the stocks in that index to achieve the same return as the market. Their advantages lie in low costs, risk diversification, and stable returns.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;The Oracle of Omaha&rdquo; buys index funds</strong>:  Investment gurus like Warren Buffett, Paul Samuelson, and Daniel Kahneman all recommend index funds because they provide market-average returns at the lowest cost, outperforming the vast majority of actively managed funds over the long term.
<ul>
<li>Example: Buffett suggests putting 90% of one&rsquo;s funds into an ultra-low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>78% of active fund returns go to the advisors&rsquo; pockets</strong>:  The high fees (management fees, transaction costs, commissions, etc.) of actively managed funds will eat up most of the investors&rsquo; gains. Generally, their returns underperform index funds over the long run.
<ul>
<li>Example: The author&rsquo;s wife could have earned an extra $20,000 if she had invested in index funds instead of actively managed funds, as recommended by her financial advisor, over the past five years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t bother picking &ldquo;top actively managed funds&rdquo;</strong>: There is no reliable method to consistently pick actively managed funds that will outperform index funds. Even if a fund has a history of exceptional performance, it doesn&rsquo;t guarantee future success. Their returns tend to revert to the average or lower in the long run.
<ul>
<li>Example: Investors in Morningstar&rsquo;s five-star-rated funds often experience lower long-term returns compared to index fund investors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;International citizens&rdquo; should opt for index funds</strong>:  Actively managed funds are significantly more expensive outside of the US. Therefore, &ldquo;international citizens&rdquo; should choose index funds to lower their investment costs.</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stay rational, earn 10% returns even in a bear market</strong>: Don&rsquo;t let fear and greed dictate your investment decisions. Don&rsquo;t panic sell in a falling market or chase rising prices in a bull market. Stick to regular investment and buy more cheap stocks in a bear market to achieve higher returns in the long run.
<ul>
<li>Example: During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, investors who steadily invested in index funds at the lows ultimately reaped higher returns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t try to time the market</strong>:  No one can accurately predict short-term market trends; don&rsquo;t try to beat the market by timing it. Market timing often causes you to miss the best investment opportunities, leading to lower investment returns.</li>
<li><strong>Earning 150%? Be wary of tech stocks</strong>:  Don&rsquo;t be fooled by high-growth, high-valuation stocks. Stock prices eventually revert to the level justified by corporate earnings. Blindly chasing hot stocks can easily lead to losing your entire investment.
<ul>
<li>Example: The dot-com bubble burst in 1999, causing countless investors to suffer heavy losses. The author himself lost nearly half of his money due to investing in Nortel Networks stock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Falling stocks: a buying opportunity</strong>:  A bear market is the best time to invest. Seize the opportunity to buy more cheap stocks when prices are low. In the long run, stocks rise with corporate earnings growth.</li>
<li><strong>Young people should be excited when stocks rebound</strong>: Young investors have more time to allow compound interest to work its magic. They should actually hope for market declines to buy more low-priced stocks. Over the long term, stocks bought at a discount offer higher returns.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Buy bonds as insurance for your stocks</strong>:  Bonds offer lower returns than stocks but have lower volatility, reducing the overall risk of your portfolio. They act as a buffer when the stock market falls.
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-term bonds: a safe haven for your money</strong>:  Short-term bonds are less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and are more suitable as a &ldquo;safety cushion&rdquo; for your portfolio.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Adjusting your portfolio to profit from market crashes</strong>:  Determine the appropriate mix of stocks and bonds based on your age and risk tolerance. Rebalance your portfolio regularly (e.g., review it annually), selling bonds to buy stocks in a down market and selling stocks to buy bonds in a bull market.
<ul>
<li>Example: Before the 2008 financial crisis, the author created a portfolio with a 35% bond allocation. During the downturn, he consistently increased his stock holdings. Consequently, he achieved higher returns when the market rebounded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Globalize&rdquo; your investment</strong>: Don&rsquo;t limit yourself to the domestic market. Diversify your investments across the globe to further reduce risk and access a wider range of opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Lazy portfolio&rdquo;: adjust once a year for annual returns</strong>:  Allocate your portfolio equally between stocks and bonds, rebalance once a year. This simple strategy delivers impressive long-term returns without demanding excessive time or effort.
<ul>
<li>Example: Following the &ldquo;Lazy Portfolio&rdquo; strategy allowed investors to achieve positive returns even during the 2008 financial crisis.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>ETFs: Access Global Markets with One Account</strong>:  Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a convenient way to invest in index funds. They are traded on stock exchanges like individual stocks and cover a wide array of global markets.
<ul>
<li><strong>How to buy ETFs?:</strong> The author details the steps involved in buying ETFs: opening a brokerage account, finding the ETF ticker symbol, determining the price per share, and setting the investment amount, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Limit orders vs. market orders:</strong> The author explains these two common ETF order types and recommends using limit orders to avoid losses due to price fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>US Indexes: Strategic Allocation for Optimal Returns</strong>:  For US investors, a portfolio split equally between a US stock market index, a global stock market index, and a US bond market index, with annual rebalancing, is recommended for stable long-term returns.
<ul>
<li>Example: The author&rsquo;s friend, Chris, following this approach, grew his portfolio by 73.09% in 10 years despite experiencing the 2008-2009 financial crisis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Canadian Indexes: Minimize Costs for Maximum Returns</strong>:  Canadians can build a low-cost, diversified global portfolio using TD Bank&rsquo;s &ldquo;e-Series&rdquo; index funds or ETFs.
<ul>
<li>The author uses personal anecdotes to illustrate that Canadian financial advisors are more inclined to recommend actively managed funds while overlooking low-cost index funds.</li>
<li>He uses the example of Air Force Technician, Felix, to demonstrate how investors can build a low-cost, diversified portfolio through TD&rsquo;s &ldquo;e-Series&rdquo; index funds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>UK Indexes: Avoid High Fees, Optimize your Portfolio</strong>:  UK investors should be wary of high-fee index funds. Building a diversified portfolio using low-cost index funds or ETFs provided by Vanguard or iShares is recommended.
<ul>
<li>The author cites Virgin Money as an example to demonstrate how high fees and tracking errors can significantly affect index fund returns.</li>
<li>He then uses the case of software engineer, Paul, to illustrate how investors can utilize iShares and Vanguard ETFs to build a low-cost, diversified portfolio.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Australian Indexes: Multi-Asset Portfolios, Lower Fees with Higher Investments</strong>:  Australians can opt for Vanguard&rsquo;s multi-asset LifeStrategy funds or utilize platforms like Stockspot and Ignition Wealth to build ETF portfolios.

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Singapore indexes: Low cost, smart allocation</strong>:  Singaporean investors should also be cautious of high-fee index funds. Building a diversified portfolio using low-cost ETFs offered by Vanguard is recommended, but it&rsquo;s important to avoid ETFs traded on US exchanges to avert US estate taxes.
<ul>
<li>The author utilizes the example of &ldquo;Fundsupermart&rsquo;s&rdquo; &ldquo;S&amp;P 500 index&rdquo; fund to illustrate how high fees significantly impact long-term investment returns.</li>
<li>He further uses the case of a professor couple to show how investors can construct a diversified portfolio using ETFs traded on Singaporean and Canadian exchanges, thus avoiding US estate taxes.</li>

<li><strong>Why do index investors lag behind the index?:</strong> Many investors fall prey to their emotions, making irrational decisions during market fluctuations, or are swayed by investment predictions, ultimately hindering their returns.
<ul>
<li>Example: Some investors panic sell during market downturns and chase rising prices in a bull market, resulting in returns far lower than the index itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>US Robo-Advisors: Let the Smart Investors &ldquo;Win&rdquo; Effortlessly</strong>: Robo-advisor platforms can help investors create and manage low-cost index fund portfolios, rebalancing them regularly, and preventing investors from damaging their accounts.
<ul>
<li>Example: Vanguard&rsquo;s Target Retirement Funds offer a one-stop solution at a very low cost, suitable for those who prefer a hands-off approach to investment.
<ul>
<li>The author uses his wife as an example to highlight the advantages of Vanguard Target Retirement Funds: achieving positive returns even without investment knowledge.</li>

<li><strong>Vanguard&rsquo;s Comprehensive Financial Advisory Services:</strong> Vanguard provides comprehensive financial planning services at a low cost, making it a good option for investors seeking professional advice.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Guidance Training Services:</strong> Mark Zoril of PlanVision offers training services that guide investors to open low-cost brokerage accounts and build their own index fund portfolios.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Enhancement Services:</strong> Scott Burns of AssetBuilder provides investment enhancement services, using Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA) index funds to help investors build a &ldquo;Lazy Portfolio&rdquo;.

<li><strong>Betterment, Rebalance IRA, SigFig, and Wealthfront:</strong> These companies also offer robo-advisory services, building and managing portfolios consisting of index funds or ETFs for investors.</li>

<li><strong>Canadian Robo-Advisors: Lower Cost and More Targeted:</strong> Robo-advisor platforms in Canada, such as WealthBar and Wealthsimple, offer lower-cost, personalized services, tailoring portfolios to suit client risk tolerance and investment goals.
<ul>
<li>The author uses personal experiences to demonstrate that Canadian bank advisors still favor actively managed funds over low-cost index funds.</li>
<li><strong>Tangerine:</strong> Tangerine bank provides Canadian investors with a financial product that encompasses a diversified index fund portfolio. Low cost makes it suitable for those who prefer to invest small sums regularly.

<ul>
<li><strong>Identifying Financial Advisors&rsquo; Tricks:</strong> Financial advisors use various tactics to persuade investors to buy actively managed funds, such as claiming that &ldquo;index funds are more dangerous during downturns&rdquo; or that &ldquo;index funds can only achieve average returns,&rdquo; both of which are misleading.
<ul>
<li>Examples:  When the author and his friend sought advice from financial advisors, they were aggressively steered towards actively managed funds without mention of their high fees or lower returns. One advisor even claimed index funds were riskier and that actively managed funds were better suited for navigating bear markets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Index Fund Returns Outshine &ldquo;Financial Elites&rdquo;</strong>: Even seasoned investment professionals like pension fund managers struggle to beat index fund returns. Many pension funds have started shifting towards indexed investments, allocating a significant portion of their funds to index funds.
<ul>
<li>Example: A study by US consulting firm FutureMetrics revealed that less than 30% of large corporate pension funds outperformed a diversified portfolio holding 60% S&amp;P 500 index and 40% corporate bond index.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Accidentally Become a &ldquo;Second-Rate Investor&rdquo;</strong>:  Don&rsquo;t be fooled by financial advisors&rsquo; sales pitches. Trust the data and facts - index funds are the most reliable way to profit in the stock market. Advisors&rsquo; interests are often at odds with those of their clients; they prioritize commission income over investor returns.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stock Picking Scams: Do their stock recommendations really work?:</strong>  Investment newsletter predictions are often inaccurate, and their recommended stocks are likely to lead to financial ruin. Their primary goal is to attract subscribers, not to help investors make money.
<ul>
<li>Example: The author invested in stocks recommended by &ldquo;The Gilder Technology Report&rdquo; and suffered significant losses.  The author of that report continues to publish similar reports, using the lure of high past returns to attract investors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Investing in Emerging Markets: Don&rsquo;t be fooled by GDP</strong>: High economic growth does not necessarily translate into high stock market returns. Be cautious when investing in emerging markets. They are more volatile and risky, and their long-term returns may not surpass developed markets.
<ul>
<li>Example: While China&rsquo;s GDP grew rapidly from 2008 to 2016, its stock market performance was lackluster, with investors in a large-cap Chinese stock ETF experiencing a 30% loss.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Gold speculation&rdquo;: It&rsquo;s not investing</strong>: Gold has a low long-term return rate with high price volatility, making it unsuitable for long-term investment. &ldquo;Gold speculators&rdquo; attempt to profit from price differences by buying low and selling high, a risky strategy that cannot guarantee stable long-term returns.
<ul>
<li>Example: $1 worth of gold purchased in 1801 would only be worth $73 in 2016, whereas a $1 investment in the US stock market during the same period would turn into $16.24 million.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Investment Magazines: The Untold Truth</strong>:  Investment magazines rely heavily on advertising revenue, leading them to cater to their advertisers rather than prioritize investors&rsquo; needs. They often recommend high-fee actively managed funds while neglecting low-cost index funds.
<ul>
<li>Example: In April 2009, &ldquo;SmartMoney&rdquo; magazine recommended bond funds and gold, ignoring the investment opportunity presented by low-priced stocks amidst the financial crisis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hedge Funds: Picking the Pockets of the Rich</strong>: Hedge funds charge exorbitant fees and carry significant risks, with long-term returns that are often no better, and sometimes even worse, than index funds. Their reported performance is often skewed by &ldquo;survivorship bias&rdquo; and &ldquo;backfill bias.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Example: Hedge funds struggle to achieve an average annual compounded return of even 1%.  Only one out of the top 20 largest hedge funds has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t buy currency-hedged ETFs</strong>: Currency-hedged ETFs  aim to eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on investment returns. However, the hedging mechanism itself incurs costs, decreasing a portfolio&rsquo;s returns.
<ul>
<li>Example: Research indicates that non-currency-hedged ETFs generally outperform their currency-hedged counterparts over the long term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t fall for smart beta funds</strong>: These hybrid funds fall somewhere between active and index funds, attempting to achieve excess returns with specific strategies. Their effectiveness is debated, and their fees are generally higher.
<ul>
<li>Example:  Studies show that the market capitalization growth of smart beta funds has been primarily due to valuation increases, not corporate earnings growth, suggesting potential decreases in future returns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t blindly buy into small-cap stocks</strong>:  Small-cap stocks, those of smaller companies, offer high growth potential, but also carry higher risk. Investing in them requires careful consideration and risk tolerance; avoid chasing high returns blindly.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a financial expert; even with a moderate income, you can achieve financial freedom through prudent spending and rational investing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This encapsulates the core message of the book:  financial management and investment are not exclusive to the wealthy; ordinary people can also achieve financial freedom through learning and practical application.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Time is money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This emphasizes that time is our most valuable asset. The earlier you start investing, the longer the time horizon for compound interest to work its magic, leading to faster wealth accumulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A successful investor should follow two principles: the first is to never lose money and the second is to never forget the first principle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote highlights the importance of risk management and capital preservation in investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The investor&rsquo;s task is to focus on the horse, not the jockey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that investors should prioritize a company&rsquo;s intrinsic value over the fund manager&rsquo;s individual ability. Over the long run, a company&rsquo;s profitability is the most important factor determining its stock price.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you plan to live off hamburgers for the rest of your life, but you don&rsquo;t own any cattle, would you want beef prices to go up or down?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Buffett used this analogy to illustrate that stocks represent ownership in a company. When share prices fall, long-term investors should view it as an opportunity to buy more shares.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most insidious devil is the high cost associated with holding certain actively managed funds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote emphasizes that investment costs are one of the most important factors affecting investment returns. Choosing low-cost index funds maximizes gains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How much you can accumulate in your lifetime depends not on how much you can earn, but on how you invest. Money finds people more effectively than people find money. Let your money work for you, not the other way around.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Buffett stresses the importance of investment and financial management, pointing out that wealth accumulation relies not only on income but also on how you manage and invest your money.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Too much money can harm investment returns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seemingly paradoxical statement highlights a critical principle: avoid over-diversification and the blind pursuit of high returns. Concentrating your investments in a few high-quality assets and holding them for the long term often yields better results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In stock investing, luck inevitably plays a role, but in the long run, good luck and bad luck offset each other. For sustained success, skills and sound principles are essential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This emphasizes that the key to successful investing lies in mastering the correct investment philosophy and principles and adhering to them in the long term, rather than relying on luck.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let time and money work for you; you just need to sit back and wait for the results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This emphasizes the power of long-term investment and compound interest. By choosing the right investment method and being patient, significant returns will follow.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Emotions are the biggest enemy in investing. You need to avoid being influenced by news and information, stay rational, and refrain from chasing rising or falling markets.</li>
<li>Investing requires a long-term perspective, aiming for a timeframe of 40 years or more. Warren Buffett acquired 99% of his wealth after the age of 50, demonstrating that patience is key to wealth creation.</li>
<li>Choose investment targets that are consistently stable and provide high returns. Index funds are the best option, especially QQQ, which boasts a long-term annualized return of 14%.</li>
<li>Adhere to the &ldquo;never sell&rdquo; strategy to allow assets to continue appreciating. Avoid selling stocks unless absolutely necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scam Avoidance Guide:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Be wary of various investment traps. Do not trust any projects that guarantee high returns, especially those that require you to sell existing assets for new investments.</li>
<li>Do not readily believe any investment or financial management information received via phone, text messages, or online platforms. Any information involving bank accounts or government departments must be verified through official channels.</li>
<li>Be cautious of aggressive sales tactics from financial institutions. Stick to your investment plan and avoid being lured by various fancy financial products.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Real Estate Investment:</strong>
<ul>
<li>James advises against homeownership for average working individuals, believing it turns them into &ldquo;mortgage slaves&rdquo; burdened with heavy loan pressure, hindering wealth accumulation.</li>
<li>He advocates for a &ldquo;rent instead of buy&rdquo; approach, suggesting using a stock pledge loan to rent high-quality housing at lower interest rates, then investing the saved funds for higher returns.</li>
<li>Consider purchasing real estate only when your assets reach a certain scale and you can comfortably afford the payment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New Trends in China&rsquo;s Economy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The People&rsquo;s Bank of China recently introduced a series of potent fiscal policies, including reserve requirement ratio and interest rate cuts, injecting funds into banks, and encouraging stock purchases, to stimulate economic growth.</li>
<li>These policies will contribute positively to stabilizing China&rsquo;s real estate market, boosting consumer confidence, and promoting global economic recovery.</li>
<li>Investors should pay attention to developments in the Chinese market and seize new investment opportunities.</li>

<p><strong>IM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Through conversations with individuals of different age groups, IM discovered that most people have insufficient awareness of long-term savings and are often constrained by mortgages and other factors. By comparing the returns of index funds in different countries and regions with those of fixed deposits and pensions, IM illustrated the advantages of long-term investment in index funds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>INGYNYING:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: INGYNYING&rsquo;s mother wanted to sell all her assets to purchase a house but, after persuasion, realized that this would lead to losing opportunities for asset appreciation. Many of INGYNYING&rsquo;s friends are afraid of change, preferring to endure the hardships of their current situation rather than attempt new investment methods.</li>
<li>Question: How to convince family members to accept new investment concepts?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: Utilize data and case studies for illustration, such as comparing the long-term returns of fixed deposits and index funds, and sharing success stories of investors. It&rsquo;s also important to respect family members&rsquo; choices and refrain from forcing them to accept new ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Questions:  Should someone with assets worth 50 times their annual living expenses use their salary to pay for a car? How can a couple combine their stock accounts for collateral purposes?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: It is recommended to utilize Tesla&rsquo;s official website loan to purchase a vehicle, then use funds from a stock pledge loan to repay the car loan. Dedicate your salary entirely to investment. Couples can combine their accounts through a joint account for collateral, sharing the limit, while their accounts remain individually managed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Eric&rsquo;s mother is visiting the US and is concerned about medical expenses. How should this be  handled?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer:  Purchasing travel insurance is advised, but excessive worry is unnecessary. Most non-emergency situations can be treated back home. If encountering extremely high medical costs, attempting negotiation with the hospital or seeking alternative solutions is possible. Due to the specific circumstances of foreign nationality and lack of income, the hospital may choose not to pursue the medical expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dean:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Dean purchased a new car using Tesla&rsquo;s website loan and a stock pledge loan, conserving a significant amount of capital. Learning about investing boosted Dean&rsquo;s confidence to decline a high-paying job and choose to stay home with their child.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Questions: How to secure a loan from Tesla&rsquo;s official website for a car purchase? Can funds from 401k or IRA accounts be used for collateral? What are the options if QQQ is not available in their company&rsquo;s 401k plan?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: To apply for a car loan through Tesla&rsquo;s website, choose the desired model and configuration, click &ldquo;Order Now&rdquo;, and select &ldquo;Finance&rdquo;. Funds in retirement accounts cannot be used as collateral; it is recommended to transfer part of those funds to a brokerage account for collateral purposes.  Alternative options include choosing an S&amp;P 500 index fund or inquiring with the company about the possibility of Blockage Link to invest in QQQ.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EVA:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: As a single, middle-aged woman with limited savings, how to balance work and investment? Should selling the house be considered for investment purposes?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: Continue working diligently while consistently making monthly investments. Even small amounts will accumulate over 8-9 years, reaching the threshold for collateral, allowing you to leverage and accelerate wealth growth. Selling a house for investment is an option but requires careful consideration based on personal circumstances.  If renting is more cost-effective, choose to rent and allocate the funds to investments yielding higher returns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Questions:  Any knowledge regarding the latest Roth SEP IRA policy?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: The policy information is quite recent, and the accuracy of the $69,000 limit requires verification. Consulting with professionals like a financial advisor at Chase or Lisa is recommended. As it is a new product, not all institutions may offer it.</li>
<li>Sharing: Jenny shared a personal experience of being scammed, reminding everyone to exercise caution and avoid trusting any investment information, particularly those spread through unofficial channels.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Haoqing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Haoqing relayed the experiences of close friends falling victim to scams, lamenting that scam tactics are constantly evolving and are hard to guard against, even for highly educated individuals.</li>
<li>Question: How can investment concepts be better conveyed to people around us to prevent them from being deceived? Is there a need to explain professional investment knowledge?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: Avoid explaining intricate investment knowledge; simply emphasize the core principle of long-term investment in index funds. Excessive professional details may confuse them, making them more susceptible to being misled by other investment information and ultimately falling prey to scams.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Recounted an NFT scam incident encountered on Clubhouse, warning everyone to be wary of risks in the cryptocurrency world. Expressed gratitude toward James&rsquo; investment philosophy for helping them avoid such traps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Amy shared personal encounters with scams, including impersonations of government departments and courier companies. She emphasized the importance of relying only on written communication and ignoring any investment information delivered through phone calls or text messages. Amy suggested that, when in doubt, contact official channels for clarification.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Becky:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Suggestion: Avoid answering calls from unfamiliar numbers, set up spam filters, and use a less important email address when necessary to share personal information to minimize the risk of scams.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: What are your thoughts on China&rsquo;s most recent economic policies? Are they sustainable?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: The People&rsquo;s Bank of China has introduced powerful policies that are having a positive impact on economic confidence. Investors should keep an eye on these developments. Although the policies appear to be heading in a positive direction, their sustainability remains to be seen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Julia:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question:  Any updates on the Roth SEP IRA policy? Are there any financial institutions already offering related products?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: The policy information is fairly new, and the $69,000 limit&rsquo;s accuracy is debatable. Consulting with a professional is advised. Being a new product, not all institutions might offer it yet.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>“You have enough money when you have enough.&quot;
&ndash; Many people</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many individuals believe that having just enough to get by is sufficient. This is a mistaken notion, as money is never truly enough. True financial freedom lies in possessing the power of choice – going wherever you want, doing whatever you desire – instead of being constrained by finances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Never borrow money for investments.&rdquo;
&ndash; Many people</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many believe that borrowing for investment is unwise; however, this viewpoint is overly cautious. True investors, like Warren Buffett, skillfully leverage debt. Following the principle of &ldquo;borrow for consumption, invest for asset growth&rdquo;, the correct approach is to use borrowed money for expenses and personal money for investment. This enables rapid wealth accumulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All investment information received through phone calls, text messages, or online platforms is not trustworthy.”
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nowadays, numerous scams operate through these channels. It&rsquo;s crucial to exercise caution and avoid blindly believing any financial advice or information. Anything involving bank accounts or government departments must be verified through official sources. Additionally, seeking guidance from qualified professionals is essential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Investment must be consistently stable over the long term, which is why index funds are the only viable option.&quot;
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within the complex investment landscape, index funds stand out as a few reliable options capable of offering consistent stability and high returns. Index funds are like living organisms; they will never die, whereas all individual stocks will eventually disappear within a century.  If you&rsquo;re looking for generational wealth, index funds are the way to go.</p>

<p>This session focused on the nature of capitalism and a brainless investment strategy.

<ul>
<li><strong>The Essence of Capitalism:</strong> James likened capitalism to a massive AI, with complex and opaque operating mechanisms that can easily lead to confusion. He argued that capitalism is not inherently evil but a tool, the key being the user&rsquo;s mindset and approach. Similar to the emergence of AI, capitalism also evolved from simple buy-and-sell relationships, its complexity making it difficult to predict and understand.</li>
<li><strong>Brainless Investing Strategy:</strong> &ldquo;Buy when you have money, and never sell.&rdquo;  He emphasized index fund investing, particularly the Nasdaq-100 index fund (QQQ), as the core investment vehicle. He opposed over-diversification, believing that focusing on the US market is more effective due to its fairness, justice, and openness.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Asset Allocation:</strong> Asset allocation is the core of investing, and it&rsquo;s crucial to develop a suitable strategy based on individual circumstances. James provided relevant links and video resources to help the audience learn more. A safe and sound asset allocation should be able to cope with market fluctuations, ensuring that even if the market drops to zero, one can still maintain their lifestyle for many years.  He highlighted the concept of &ldquo;being able to live comfortably for over a decade regardless of market fluctuations.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>The True Meaning of Financial Freedom:</strong> True financial freedom is not just about possessing wealth but also about &ldquo;knowing how to spend.&rdquo; This means understanding one&rsquo;s asset situation and knowing how much can be freely spent annually and monthly.  He emphasized the concept of &ldquo;knowing what to spend and spending it freely when desired.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Parenting and Responsibility:</strong> He encouraged young people to have children and cultivate their sense of responsibility and financial awareness from a young age, enabling them to be self-reliant. He shared his experience of educating his daughter, emphasizing the importance of letting children bear the consequences of their actions, starting with small things.</li>
<li><strong>The Meaning of Learning:</strong> The purpose of learning is not just for monetary gain but for ultimate enlightenment. One should absorb knowledge like a sponge, cultivate thinking abilities, and ultimately reach the state of &ldquo;decreasing knowledge to gain wisdom.&rdquo; He used the example of martial arts manuals to illustrate that learning is a process from having something to having nothing.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Spending money is moral.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spending money should not be seen as negative; knowing how to spend and being willing to spend is the only way to truly enjoy the freedom that wealth brings. Also emphasized taking advantage of credit card benefits, points, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more we know, the greater the risks we don&rsquo;t know.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As our knowledge increases, we need to be more cautious in identifying and assessing potential unknown risks. The real risk is the unknown risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The class of those who know and those who don&rsquo;t.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a disparity in information and knowledge in capitalist society, leading to class differentiation between those who know and those who don&rsquo;t. Wealth and capital are concentrated in the hands of a few.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I may not know where I&rsquo;m sailing, but I know there are some paths I can no longer take.
&ndash; Sam</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the road of life, clarifying what you don&rsquo;t want is more important than knowing what you want.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Advantages of Index Funds:</strong> Long-term index fund investing eliminates the need to follow short-term market fluctuations, international affairs, financial reports, and economic data.  Focus on asset allocation and consistent investment.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Compounding:</strong> James uses several examples to illustrate the magic of compounding:  A monthly investment of 1000 TWD can grow to 17.3 million TWD in 40 years; a lump-sum investment of 100,000 TWD can reach 18.8 million TWD in 40 years;  starting early is crucial, as a 10-year delay significantly impacts final returns; one share of QQQ at 500 USD will become 25,000 USD in 30 years and 94,000 USD in 40 years.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Asset Allocation:</strong> Asset allocation is more critical than any market commentary. James recommends deleveraging and reducing debt for those nearing retirement, holding a larger cash position.  For younger individuals with stable income, leveraging can be considered. He suggests using a beta of 1.0 as a benchmark, reducing beta when the market is overheated, and increasing it back to 1.0 during market downturns.  For cash allocation, he references Buffett and suggests a sample allocation (Scenario 3): 40% index funds, 30% 2x leveraged funds, and 30% cash.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of Investment Scams:</strong>  Don&rsquo;t trust investment information from unknown accounts or websites. Choose legitimate financial institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Give Money Directly to Children:</strong> James uses personal anecdotes and case studies to caution against putting assets directly in children&rsquo;s names, as this may discourage their initiative or cause family conflicts.  However, investing children&rsquo;s &ldquo;lucky money&rdquo; (red envelopes) for them is recommended as an educational fund.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Real Estate Investment:</strong> James reiterates his advice against early homeownership for young people, arguing that real estate is illiquid, high-risk, and ties up capital that could be used for other investments.  He highlights the added risk in Taiwan, where mortgage debt remains even after foreclosure.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended Learning Resources:</strong> He recommends a YouTube channel called &ldquo;什么值得读&rdquo; (What&rsquo;s Worth Reading) for valuable content on value investing.</li>
<li><strong>Emergency Fund:</strong> Maintain a cash reserve equivalent to six months of living expenses in a money market fund account. Investing this emergency fund in stocks is not recommended.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Cat:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shares: A listener holding 35 million TWD in 00662 still finds the 2% withdrawal rate insufficient. Discusses the spending needs and inheritance considerations of single individuals.</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response: Different indices have different volatility and dividend yields, requiring adjustments to withdrawal rates. For higher withdrawals, consider ETFs with higher dividend yields, such as 0056, which yields around 4-5%.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>H:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question:  High rental costs for young people, should they buy a house?  Mortgages offer tax deductions, while renting does not.  Concerned about insufficient funds for leveraged investing.</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response:  Recommends watching the &ldquo;30 Years of Different Destinies&rdquo; video, which analyzes the pros and cons of renting versus buying.  Young people should prioritize investing in index funds to build wealth through compounding and consider buying a house later.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Yonglin:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Should money be invested in children&rsquo;s names for long-term holding?  Should a mortgage-free house be sold to invest in index funds after retirement?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response:  Advises against putting money directly in children&rsquo;s names.  Retirees should deleverage, and selling a mortgage-free house to invest in index funds is a viable option.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shares: Success story of investing his children&rsquo;s education fund in QQQ.  Gives the example of Taoyuan Language in Taiwan, suggesting potential leveraged investment through real estate mortgages.</li>
<li>Question: How to establish a family trust and manage generational wealth like the Rockefeller family?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response:  Recommends contacting Lisa for trust advice when assets reach a certain level and age. For now, focus on investing. Trusts can be considered around 70-80 years old. Single individuals or those without children should rely on trusts, appointing guardians and executors.  Those with children can consider Trust 2.0, with the bank as executor and children as supervisors.  Family foundations managed by professional institutions are also an option.  Recommends the Walmart family&rsquo;s living trust as a model.</li>

<p><strong>Becky, Jessie, and Other Participants:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Becky: Difficulties of renting at an older age.</li>
<li>Jessie: How to balance saving for an emergency fund, paying off a mortgage, and investing simultaneously.</li>
<li>Other Participants: Questions about real estate investment, cash management, insurance, Bitcoin, and Japanese government bonds.</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response:  Addresses each question and reiterates his investment philosophy.  For example, young people should avoid real estate and insurance due to high risks; long-term bonds and municipal bonds are not suitable for emergency funds.</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Investment Objective:</strong> Identify high-quality investment targets, such as market-capitalization-weighted index funds, and hold them for the long term. Avoid chasing high-return investment targets, as excessive volatility may lead to an inability to hold, ultimately hindering returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Risk Control:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not overestimate your risk tolerance, as market downturns often exceed expectations.</li>
<li>Selling leads to permanent losses; the only mistake in the market is selling.</li>
<li>Investing is a process that goes against human nature, requiring the overcoming of fear and greed.</li>
<li>Always ensure survival in extreme market conditions, meaning possessing sufficient cash flow to sustain living expenses.</li>
<li>Holding cash is crucial for mitigating risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investment Mindset:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Investors should remain perpetually optimistic, believing that the market will eventually rise.</li>
<li>Be patient, as wealth accumulation takes time.</li>
<li>Do not be swayed by short-term market fluctuations; adhere to a long-term investment strategy.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to predict the market, and ignore market noise.</li>
<li>Keep investing simple: buy when you have money and hold for the long term; avoid excessive trading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Allocation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The highest guiding principle of asset allocation is: you can still survive under extreme market conditions.</li>
<li>Retirees need to hold more cash and can utilize leveraged funds to enhance returns while reducing risks.</li>
<li>Employed individuals can choose different asset allocation plans based on their circumstances, but ensure a certain proportion of cash holdings.</li>
<li>Do not alter your asset allocation based on market ups and downs, as this constitutes short-term trading behavior.</li>
<li>Asset allocation needs to be adjusted based on individual situations. For example, when significant events like retirement or purchasing a house occur, reassessment and adjustment of the asset allocation plan are necessary.</li>
<li>Leverage initially carries higher risk, which gradually decreases as the market rises.</li>
<li>It is recommended that retirement accounts comprise at least 30% of total assets to effectively avoid taxes during rebalancing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Market Efficiency:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The market is efficient; it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to find opportunities for consistent excess returns.</li>
<li>Do not readily believe investment strategies claiming to achieve excess returns, as they are often unsustainable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Role of Wall Street:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wall Street&rsquo;s primary roles are to provide liquidity and investment products, establish the framework for investment transactions, and lower the barriers to entry, allowing ordinary investors to participate.</li>
<li>Investors need to understand how Wall Street operates to avoid falling into its traps.</li>
<li>Market makers are a crucial part of Wall Street. They profit by providing bid-ask spreads while also offering liquidity to the market.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>IM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Black swan events remind us that people are forgetful, easily becoming optimistic during market upswings and panicking during downturns.</li>
<li>Question: How to control optimism and avoid overconfidence leading to bankruptcy?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response: Remember the highest guiding principle of asset allocation, ensuring survival under extreme conditions. Cash is the lifeline for survival.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sunny:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: How to persuade people around me not to purchase insurance and financial products?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response: By calculating the annualized return rate of insurance products and comparing it with the return rates of other investment products, you can demonstrate that insurance and financial products offer lower returns. You can compare the return rates of insurance products with the long-term returns of index funds and point out that the income source for insurance companies and insurance agents is the premiums paid by customers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Experienced Apple Vision Pro and found its spatial computing capabilities impressive, but currently, it has limited functionality and applications, along with a high price tag.</li>
<li>Question: If investing is so simple, what is the role of Wall Street experts?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response: Wall Street&rsquo;s role primarily lies in providing liquidity, investment products, and the trading infrastructure, lowering the barriers to entry, enabling ordinary investors to participate in the market. Market makers are an essential component of Wall Street, making profits by providing bid-ask spreads while also offering liquidity to the market.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: How can employed individuals utilize the asset allocation plan in Scenario 9?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response: Scenario 9 is suitable for retired individuals with loans. If you are employed and have substantial loans, such as a mortgage, you need to adjust the plan based on your circumstances. For example, pay off a portion of the loan before proceeding with asset allocation. Moreover, leverage carries higher risk initially, which gradually decreases as the market rises.</li>
<li>Question: How to allocate and rebalance assets between a 401K account and a Roth IRA account?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response: It&rsquo;s recommended that retirement accounts comprise at least 30% of total assets for effective tax avoidance during rebalancing. Due to the limited investment options within a 401K account, direct purchase of QQQ may not be possible. You can use similar alternatives or transfer funds to a Roth IRA account for more flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Yingying:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: What&rsquo;s the difference between QQQ and QQQM?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response: The market is efficient. There won&rsquo;t be a significant difference in the long-term returns of QQQ and QQQM. Choose QQQ, which has lower fees.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Should I convert 0066 to 00670L during a market downturn?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s response: Do not change your asset allocation based on market fluctuations, as this constitutes short-term trading behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using Fatality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s response: Charles Schwab is recommended because it is both a brokerage and a bank, offering higher security. Fidelity only has brokerage services and lacks a banking license, potentially facing risks during financial crises.</li>
</ul>
