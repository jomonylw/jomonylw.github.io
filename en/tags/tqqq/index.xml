<p>The core of this session is the mindset and strategy investors should adopt in an ever-innovating market. Teacher James emphasizes that the market&rsquo;s long-term trend is upward, and one should enter as early as possible and hold on. At the same time, he deeply analyzes two common yet high-risk assets: real estate and leveraged funds. He argues that real estate is not a good investment and carries extremely high risk. As for leveraged funds, while their short-term returns are tempting, their violent fluctuations can lead to a total loss of investment. Therefore, it is essential to control risk and lock in profits through &ldquo;smart rebalancing.&rdquo; Ultimately, only index funds are quality assets that can be passed down through generations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James once again recommended &ldquo;The Bible of Wealth Management,&rdquo; published in 1996, believing its philosophy is still highly relevant today and is a national treasure of a book.</li>
<li><strong>Core Philosophy</strong>: &ldquo;Buy anytime, buy casually, don&rsquo;t sell.&rdquo; This strategy, similar to buying and holding the entire market, aligns perfectly with the philosophy of index funds.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Compounding</strong>: The book gives an example: investing just 1200 yuan a month at a 20% rate of return can grow to 100 million in 40 years. This demonstrates the astonishing power of long-term investment; the key to wealth is investing, not saving or having a high income.</li>
<li><strong>The Root of Wealth Inequality</strong>: The book also mentions that wealth inequality stems from a lack of financial education, which aligns closely with the mission of this channel. If you don&rsquo;t have enough funds to retire at 65, the problem lies in your personal investment failures, not society.</li>

<ul>
<li>The teacher clearly states that from a return on investment perspective, a house is not a good investment and is extremely risky.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Risk</strong>: A 30-to-40-year mortgage is like a chain. If you face a crisis like mid-life unemployment, you risk foreclosure. Without a mortgage, this worry doesn&rsquo;t exist.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Risk</strong>: Natural disasters like earthquakes and fires are frequent. Even with insurance, the process of rebuilding and relocating is filled with pain and inconvenience, like carrying a &ldquo;powder keg.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Judgment Standard</strong>: The teacher offers a vivid analogy: <strong>&ldquo;You should only buy your first house when you have the ability to buy two.&rdquo;</strong> Buying a house should be like buying slippersâ€”if they break, you can easily get a new pair. Only then is it not a risk.</li>
<li><strong>The Correct Path</strong>: First, work hard on investing to become wealthy. When your wealth reaches a certain level (e.g., 100 million, 500 million), then use borrowed funds (e.g., borrow 20 million, 100 million) to easily buy a house, achieving a &ldquo;no-money-down&rdquo; acquisition.</li>
<li><strong>Index Funds are the True &ldquo;Real Estate&rdquo;</strong>: Compared to physical property that depreciates and has holding costs (like management fees, property taxes), only index funds are quality assets that can last for a century, be passed down through generations, and become more stable over time.</li>

<ul>
<li>The teacher referenced a chart from the &ldquo;JSON Model Lab&rdquo; channel to show the extreme risk of TQQQ (3x leveraged QQQ).</li>
<li><strong>Historical Simulation</strong>: The simulation shows that one dollar invested in TQQQ in 1985 would have grown to $3,510 at the peak of the 2000 dot-com bubble, but then crashed to $1.13 in the subsequent bear market, a staggering drop of 99.96%, nearly wiping it out.</li>
<li><strong>The Trap of Long-Term Returns</strong>: Over the long period from 1985 to the present, due to decay from market volatility, TQQQ (18.28% annualized) performed worse than the 2x leveraged QLD (19.39% annualized).</li>
<li><strong>The Long Recovery Period</strong>: After the 2000 crash, QQQ reached a new high around 2014, and QLD broke even around 2022. However, if you held only TQQQ, it could take over 22 years to recover your losses, which would be devastating to any retirement plan.</li>
<li><strong>The Only Solution for Risk Control: Smart Rebalancing</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: To prevent TQQQ from dropping over 99% from its peak, which would wipe out a lifetime of investment.</li>
<li><strong>Method</strong>: At the end of the year or the beginning of the next, transfer one-third of this year&rsquo;s profits from the leveraged fund to a cash position to lock in profits and reduce risk.</li>
<li><strong>Warning</strong>: The decline of a leveraged fund is instantaneous; it might go to zero before you have a chance to rebalance. Therefore, the amount invested must be money you can afford to lose completely. The teacher does not recommend leveraged funds for beginners or those unfamiliar with their characteristics. A 70/30 (QQQ/cash) allocation is relatively stable.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pledged Asset Line (PAL) Fund Flow Warning</strong>: For investors at Charles Schwab in the US, the teacher warned that their software is now very intelligent and can track the flow of funds borrowed through a PAL. Even after multiple transfers, if the funds eventually end up in a brokerage account and are used to buy stocks, the system will detect it. You might receive a warning the first time, and subsequently, your PAL privileges could be revoked. Be careful to avoid such operations.</li>
<li><strong>View on Financial Professionals</strong>: The teacher pointedly noted that the experts and financial professionals who talk loudly in the market mostly fall into two categories:
<ol>
<li><strong>Ignorant</strong>: &ldquo;Demons and monsters&rdquo; who don&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: How to distinguish between necessary expenses and deferrable pleasures? For example, how to decide whether to buy a car or travel abroad? Is there a metric to avoid impacting future wealth through overspending?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a great question that can be solved with planning.
<ol>
<li><strong>Set a Goal</strong>: First, clarify your retirement goal, for instance, how much money you want in 20 years (e.g., 60 million).</li>
<li><strong>Calculate Required Investment</strong>: Use an investment calculator. Based on your current assets and expected rate of return (e.g., 14%), calculate how much you need to invest each month to reach your goal.</li>
<li><strong>Spend Freely</strong>: After deducting the required monthly investment from the money you can save, the remainder can be freely spent, used for travel, or put into a travel fund.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Adjustment</strong>: This calculation is dynamic. For example, if you have 10 million now and your goal is 60 million in 20 years, the calculator might show that you can even spend 66,000 per month and still reach your goal.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Don&rsquo;t save all your money; learn to spend it. You should start planning your consumption from a young age. As long as your retirement plan is not affected, you should enjoy life. Otherwise, earning a lot of money becomes meaningless. The teacher added that if you are going to spend, the memories from travel are eternalâ€”a form of spiritual consumption more valuable than material goods that depreciate.</li>

<li>Sharing: After listening to the teacher&rsquo;s classes for three months, she cleared out over a dozen miscellaneous stocks in her Canadian Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) and switched everything to TQQQ and QLD. She convinced her husband they could retire because their assets were sufficient. She is now allocating cash and QQQ in her taxable account (IBKR).</li>
<li>Question: In the future, with new TFSA contribution room each year (e.g., C$7,000 per person) and new funds coming in monthly, how should she invest? Should she buy according to the target allocation (e.g., 40% QQQ, 35% cash, 15% TQQQ), prioritize building up the cash position, or decide based on the beta value at the time?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Account Separation</strong>: Leveraged funds (TQQQ/QLD) should be in the tax-free account (TFSA); QQQ and cash should be in the taxable account (IBKR).</li>
<li><strong>Tax-Free Account</strong>: When new contribution room is available, just buy more leveraged funds. Only rebalance if the leveraged funds become an excessively large portion of your total assets.</li>
<li><strong>Taxable Account</strong>: For new monthly funds, you can simplify the process. For example, in a year with 12 months, you could designate that the savings from 4 of those months go directly to cash, and the savings from the other 8 months are used to buy QQQ. This ensures the cash position grows, and you can review and do a major rebalancing at the end of the year.</li>

<li>Sharing: Responding to the previous student&rsquo;s question about consumption, he used to be someone who saved fanatically and was afraid to spend. After listening to the teacher, he understood that if you want to buy a car, for example, you can do so as long as you ensure you still have an equivalent amount of money to continue investing in QQQ. Between memories and material things, one should invest more in creating memories (like travel).</li>
<li>Question: He received an email and a call from QQQ about a special meeting to vote on changing the fund structure from a &ldquo;Unit Investment Trust (UIT)&rdquo; to an &ldquo;Open-End Fund.&rdquo; He wanted to ask for the teacher&rsquo;s opinion on this.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a normal and positive change. The vast majority of ETFs today (like QQQM) are already open-end funds. This change allows the fund to have its own board of directors for management, freeing it from bank trusteeship, which can lower fees and increase management flexibility. My personal recommendation is to vote &ldquo;approve.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Sharing: A client of his, a cardiologist from a wealthy family, was outbid for a luxury mansion by a woman. This woman offered a higher price and had 150 million USD in cash in her bank account, wealth that came entirely from early investments in stocks like Nvidia. This story illustrates that the wealth created by successful equity investing can easily surpass the accumulation of several generations of elite professionals.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: This is very normal. For someone who understands investing, 100 million USD is the minimum threshold. Your professional income doesn&rsquo;t determine your ultimate wealth; only long-term, stable financial investment is the key to riches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: Why was the market reaction negative when the US government initially proposed to exchange subsidies for equity in companies like TSMC, but the stock price rose after the company refused? Aren&rsquo;t government subsidies the people&rsquo;s money? What&rsquo;s wrong with letting the government (the people) share in the profits?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You have to look at this from the perspective of shareholder interests.
<ol>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s Bad for Companies Not Lacking Cash</strong>: For a company with ample cash flow like TSMC, it doesn&rsquo;t need the money. Accepting government funds and issuing new shares to the government would dilute the equity of existing shareholders, which is detrimental to them. If the government wants to own TSMC stock, it should buy it on the open market, not ask the company to print shares for it.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s Good for Companies on the Brink of Bankruptcy</strong>: However, for companies in financial crisis like Ford and General Motors (GM) at the time, they desperately needed funds to survive, so they were willing to accept the government&rsquo;s terms for taking an equity stake. This was a bailout, not a normal business investment.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A healthy company has no reason to sacrifice shareholder interests to take government money.</li>

<li>Question 1: The teacher says pledged loans should not exceed 20% of total assets. Is there a percentage limit for non-pledged debt like personal loans and mortgages? His current debt of this type is about 40% of his total assets. Is this too high?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t worry at all. Personal loans and mortgages are completely different from pledged loans. They don&rsquo;t have market volatility risk and won&rsquo;t trigger a Margin Call if stock prices fall. As long as your salary plus the 2% withdrawal from your pledged line of credit can comfortably cover the interest and principal payments, this debt is safe. A 40% ratio is very healthy, far safer than someone with zero assets but a 9 million mortgage.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I recommend taking out the personal loan first. A personal loan is a loan without market volatility risk, making it relatively safer. You can take out the personal loan to invest in the market and then use the cash flow from your stock pledge (e.g., 2% annually) to pay off the interest and principal of the personal loan. Don&rsquo;t start by borrowing a large sum (like 20%) from your investment portfolio to reinvest; that would increase the risk associated with market fluctuations. Safety first.</li>

<li>Question 1: All her leveraged funds are in a Roth IRA account, and she plans to leave them untouched for another 15 years. Is a Beta value of 1.3 acceptable?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Absolutely not! 15 years is too short a time for a high-leverage allocation. If you encounter a major bear market (like in 2000), your assets might not recover before you retire. Historical data shows it took QLD (2x) 22 years to break even. A Beta of 1.3 is far too risky; you might not be able to retire smoothly. You must lower it immediately, do not exceed 1.0.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Sell it immediately, right now! This is more important than anything.

<li><strong>Financial Priority</strong>: The huge financial difference is the primary consideration.</li>
<li><strong>Value of Time</strong>: The saved commuting time is for rest, relaxation, and enjoying life, not for taking on more work.</li>
<li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: While working, you can rent a cheap place in the countryside. When you actually retire, you can move back to the city. At that point, you can choose to rent or buy, giving you complete freedom. Don&rsquo;t sacrifice a huge present benefit for an uncertain future. Procrastinating is losing money.</li>

<li>Question 1: If the stablecoin bill (Genius Act) is so good, why is its implementation delayed until January 28th of next year?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: After any major bill is passed, it takes a few months for the executive branch to prepare the related regulations, website systems, registration processes, etc. This is a normal administrative preparation period, not an intentional delay.</li>

</li>
<li>Question 2: Elon Musk criticizes the government for inefficient spending, but according to Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), the more the government spends, the better it is for the economy. How does the teacher view this contradiction?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: From an investor&rsquo;s perspective, as long as the government is willing to spend money, whether it&rsquo;s spent wisely or not, it&rsquo;s a good thing. This is because money flowing stimulates the economy, which will ultimately be reflected in stock prices. The passage of the stablecoin bill will greatly increase market liquidity. When the Treasury issues a $1 bond and a bank buys it, the bank can then issue a $1 stablecoin using the bond as collateral. This effectively doubles the liquidity in the market, making capital extremely abundant. This is a huge positive for the stock market; stock prices will soar.</li>

In contrast, RWA (Real-World Asset tokenization) and 24-hour trading will be another revolution, greatly promoting capital flow.</li>

<li>Question: With the development of AI and the massive liquidity from stablecoins, is it possible for QQQ&rsquo;s annualized return to accelerate from the current 18% to 30% in the future?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: It&rsquo;s very possible. I expect the annualized return to increase from 18% to at least 20% or more. The development of AI is exponential, and the productivity revolution it will bring is beyond imagination. Individuals and companies that do not understand or use AI will be eliminated. Investing in QQQ means you are standing at the forefront of this revolution, riding the wave with the best companies. The future growth will be astonishing, beyond all our imaginations.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The market has no peak; it will only go higher. So if you don&rsquo;t get into the market quickly, you are losing a lot of opportunities.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: At the beginning of the session, Teacher James commented on the market continually hitting new all-time highs, encouraging investors not to be afraid of heights and to enter the market as soon as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the funds to retire at 65, the problem is not with society, but with you.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Quoting a viewpoint from &ldquo;The Bible of Wealth Management,&rdquo; emphasizing that personal responsibility in investing and financial planning is key to a wealthy retirement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should only buy your first house when you have the ability to buy two. Buying a house should be like buying slippersâ€”if they break, you just get a new pair. Only then is buying a house not a risk.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When explaining the huge risks of real estate, the teacher used a vivid analogy to define what constitutes a &ldquo;risk-free&rdquo; purchase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only index funds can be considered real estate; they can last for a hundred years without spoiling, and the longer you hold them, the more stable they become. This is the asset that can be passed down for generations.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Comparing index funds to traditional real estate, emphasizing their superiority as long-term core assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leveraged funds can go to zero in an instant, you have to know they can go to zero in an instant. So you should only buy them with funds you can afford to lose, and even after buying, you still must practice smart rebalancing.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: After showing the astonishing historical decline of TQQQ, the teacher repeatedly emphasized the risk of leveraged funds going to zero and pointed out the absolute necessity of smart rebalancing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are only two kinds of financial professionals: one is ignorant, and the other is fraudulent. There probably isn&rsquo;t a third kind.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: The teacher&rsquo;s sharp commentary on the nature of most financial experts and professionals in the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who run businesses won&rsquo;t become rich; you have to understand what is called financial operation.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Responding to Hao Qing&rsquo;s sharing, pointing out that it is difficult to achieve great wealth through labor income alone; financial tools (investing and borrowing) are the key.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you only know how to invest but not how to borrow, you will still end up poor.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Further emphasizing that on top of knowing how to invest, learning to use leverage (borrowing) wisely is the advanced path from being well-off to being truly wealthy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The government&rsquo;s debt is the people&rsquo;s savings.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Citing the core idea of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) to explain why government spending and national debt growth are good for the economy and investors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Individuals and businesses without AI will perish or become poor.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When forecasting future economic growth, the teacher asserted the disruptive power of AI technology, stating that those who do not embrace AI will be left behind by the times.</p>

<p>This session covered a rich and profound range of topics, from macroeconomic market trends and investment philosophy to specific asset risk analysis and practical personal financial planning. Teacher James once again reinforced the core strategy of long-term holding of index funds and provided an in-depth analysis and risk warning for two highly tempting yet perilous assets: real estate and leveraged funds. Through the specific method of &ldquo;smart rebalancing,&rdquo; he offered a clear risk control path for investors wishing to use leverage. The Q&amp;A session tightly integrated theory with real-life situations, providing clear guidance on everything from consumption and debt management to understanding new financial legislation. Overall, this was an invaluable lesson that reminds us to stay clear-headed in a bull marketâ€”to be brave in embracing growth while always respecting risk.</p>

<p>The theme of this episode is &ldquo;Investing and Financial Management, Wealth is a Gift.&rdquo; The core viewpoints  are: <strong>Wealth is innate, but one must be informed to realize it; investing and financial management is an important way to accumulate wealth; index investing is an effective method to achieve long-term stable growth; rational asset allocation and risk control are the keys to investment success; and overcoming psychological barriers in investment and solidifying the long-term investment philosophy are crucial to ultimately achieving financial freedom.</strong></p>

</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth is a Gift:</strong> Wealth is innate, and being informed of this fact makes a huge difference. While successful entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are a minority, most people need to be told that &ldquo;wealth is a gift,&rdquo; and they need to learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Index Investing and Compound Interest:</strong> Index investing is an effective way to achieve long-term stable returns, and its compounding effect is astonishing. For example, investing $1,500 per month for 40 years with a 14% annualized return will yield $2.6 million. <strong>Even small amounts of money can accumulate considerable wealth through consistent long-term investment.</strong></li>
<li><strong>High Risk, High Return?</strong>: High risk doesn&rsquo;t necessarily lead to high returns. Whether you can bear the risk determines whether you can ultimately achieve high returns. Don&rsquo;t overestimate your risk tolerance. Your risk appetite should be determined by an asset allocation that you can withstand even if your investment goes to zero. <strong>For example, if you cannot afford the risk of TQQQ going to zero, you should not invest in TQQQ.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Choosing Investment Targets</strong>: It is recommended to invest in the global Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ). Those with insufficient funds or who are already retired can consider investing in SPY or high-dividend ETFs. Avoid investing in individual stocks because they tend to disappear over the long term, while index funds can continue to exist. <strong>The half-life of individual stocks is 10 years; out of 100 stocks, there may be less than three left after 50 years.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Investment Mindset</strong>: The market will eventually rise, and investment requires patience. Always stay optimistic, even if the investment goes to zero. Learning about investing and financial management requires continuous thinking, like peeling an onion, layer by layer, to elevate the energy of the spiritual level. <strong>Investing is like the Yellow Mountain, eternally unchanging, yet different every day; every learning experience will bring new insights.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation</strong>: Asset allocation is like building a house; it is a big project that requires comprehensive planning, not something simple. It is necessary to consider many factors, such as whether you are retired, your age, income, debt, and cash flow, to formulate a reasonable asset allocation plan. <strong>You need to carefully study the articles and videos on asset allocation provided by James to develop a plan that suits you.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do Not  Blindly Trust External Information</strong>: Financial professionals often only consider their interests, so do not easily believe their advice. Think independently, study carefully, and do not be swayed by external information and noise. <strong>Most of the outside information is garbage; do not be affected by it, focus on learning James&rsquo; investment philosophy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Balancing Risk and Reward</strong>: Do not excessively pursue high returns or completely risk-free investments; balance risk and reward. Avoid changing investment strategies easily to prevent additional costs due to frequent trading. <strong>James&rsquo; investment methods can guarantee asset appreciation and relative safety, avoiding extreme situations.</strong></li>

<p><strong>IM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing: Learning about investment is like peeling an onion; at first, the amount of information is overwhelming, but as you learn more, you will gradually understand the core idea and ultimately reach the realm of &ldquo;the great Dao is simple.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: What do you think about the idea that &ldquo;investing is simple&rdquo;?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Such views often mistake ignorance for inaction and do not truly understand the complexity and risks of investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: How should we communicate with friends who don&rsquo;t understand index investing?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can start by briefly introducing the concept and advantages of index investing and suggest that they watch related videos to learn. Don&rsquo;t force them to accept it, everyone has their own choices. <strong>Just like preaching, we can only try our best to spread the message; whether it&rsquo;s ultimately accepted depends on the individual.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LAN:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: How to calculate Beta? What is the actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can refer to the link to the article on Beta calculation on the message board. The actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF may deviate from the theoretical value due to factors such as market volatility and friction costs. <strong>When market volatility is large, the wear and tear of leveraged ETFs will be more serious, resulting in an actual Beta value lower than the theoretical value.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Why is there a huge difference in final return between scenario 3 and scenario 4.1 in the 005 topic?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Scenario 4.1 is where no money is withdrawn from the investment, so the final return will be higher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: How to adjust Beta in a rising market?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response:  The adjustment of Beta should be determined by your own risk tolerance, not by the market trend. <strong>Do not try to predict the market, just keep a fixed Beta value.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 4:  For investments in Taiwan, should I choose Q2D or 00670L?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: 00670L is recommended because it includes New Taiwan dollar hedging, which can reduce the risk caused by exchange rate fluctuations. <strong>Don&rsquo;t change investment targets frequently, choose one that suits you and hold it for the long term.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nai Xin:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Wealth is a gift, just as self-confidence is a gift; everyone has potential, but it needs to be stimulated. The key to investing and financial management lies in learning. Once you have mastered the correct investment method, you can focus on your own career and life and let wealth grow naturally over time. <strong>Overcome fear, build confidence, and you can realize your potential, gain wealth, and achieve success.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Understanding &ldquo;buy whenever you have money,&rdquo; but still finding it difficult to overcome psychological fluctuations when the market rises or falls sharply.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response:  Overcoming psychological fluctuations takes time and experience. You can try to make a small number of trades, experience the impact of market fluctuations, and gradually adapt to market changes.</li>
<li>IM Supplement: You can overcome psychological barriers by imagining starting to invest two years later and understanding that &ldquo;money arrives at different points in time.&rdquo;<strong>Don&rsquo;t worry about buying at the lowest point; as long as you stick to long-term investment, you can get good returns.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hai Rui Ji:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thank you James for selflessly sharing your investment philosophy; students learn from each other and make progress together.</li>
<li>James&rsquo; investment philosophy requires continuous learning and understanding to grasp it fully. &ldquo;Never sell&rdquo; does not mean you cannot sell, but that you should develop a reasonable investment strategy based on your own situation. ** &ldquo;Never sell&rdquo; refers to mentally ignoring market fluctuations and adhering to a long-term investment philosophy.**</li>
<li>Investment philosophy needs to keep pace with the times and adjust investment strategies according to changes in the environment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question: Already answered in the video.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Li Zi:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: To overcome psychological barriers to investment, manage accounts separately, using one part for long-term investment and the other for tentative operations, such as selling covered calls. This satisfies the desire to trade and avoids losses due to frequent trading.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You only know what is best after you have experienced it. Experience in trading can lead to a firmer commitment to a long-term investment strategy. <strong>Trying different trading strategies can help you understand the advantages of long-term investment and ultimately achieve the state of &ldquo;daily reduction for the Dao.&rdquo;</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>T:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Why has the capital market in mainland China performed poorly for a long time?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Emerging markets take time to mature. The Chinese market is like the Taiwanese market 50 years ago. It has the potential to rise in the long term, but its return may be lower than that of the US market. <strong>Investment should focus on sustainable development markets. The US market has advantages in terms of systems and industries.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Under foreign exchange control, how do I invest in US index funds? Are there any risks?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can invest by purchasing ETFs listed in China that track US index funds, such as 513100. Foreign exchange controls mainly restrict the physical flow of funds, and buying ETFs is not restricted. The current scale of such investment is small and will not trigger a quota limit. <strong>Even with foreign exchange control, it is still possible to allocate global assets through legal channels.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is a Gift
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone has the potential for wealth, but they must be informed to realize it and learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning Increases Daily, the Dao Decreases Daily
&ndash; IM</p></blockquote>
<p>Learning about investing and financial management is a process of continuous improvement. At first, you will be exposed to a large amount of information, but as your understanding deepens, you will gradually simplify your investment strategy and eventually reach the state of &ldquo;the great Dao is simple.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Difficult to Return to After Seeing a Vast Ocean
&ndash; Li Zi &amp; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Only after experiencing something can you know what is best. In investing, only after actually operating and experiencing market fluctuations and the impact of different investment strategies can you more firmly choose the long-term investment strategy that suits you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The More Money You Borrow, the More Money You Have
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Understand and control risk, not avoid it. Understanding how to use leverage can accelerate wealth growth, but only with proper risk management, such as building a solid asset allocation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cash is Air
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Cash is very important and you must keep enough cash to deal with market fluctuations and emergencies.</p>

<p>This session focuses on the philosophy of long-term investing, emphasizing the importance of independent thinking and risk management. James reiterates his long-held investment philosophy: choose the right investment target (such as QQQ), buy in early and hold for the long term, ignoring short-term market fluctuations, and ultimately achieve steady wealth growth. In addition, he discusses how to maintain a positive mindset, deal with stress and anxiety that may arise during the investment process, and how to choose a reliable brokerage to ensure account security.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth is accumulated slowly, and enjoying the process of wealth accumulation is the meaning of life.</strong> Getting rich overnight or quickly is not the best way. Slowly accumulating wealth and enjoying it allows you to experience the true meaning of life and learn and grow from it.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t blindly pursue high returns while ignoring risks.</strong> Many people pursue quick riches and hope for super high returns, but often overlook the risks involved, which may ultimately lead to losses outweighing gains. Learn to assess risk and choose an investment strategy that matches your risk tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>Investing requires finding a definite eternity, ignoring market noise, and maintaining inner peace.</strong> Index fund investing is a definite and eternal strategy that does not require painstaking research and operation. Simply holding for the long term can yield considerable returns.</li>
<li><strong>Investment is a loser&rsquo;s game, not seeking to win, but seeking not to lose.</strong>  In investing, avoiding mistakes is more important than pursuing victory. Index fund investing can help investors reduce mistakes and ultimately achieve victory.</li>
<li><strong>Buying in a lump sum at any time and holding for the long term is superior to other investment methods.</strong> Investing early and holding for the long term maximizes returns and delivers the best investment returns.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to distinguish between what can be done, what is effective, what can be worried about, and what is not worth worrying about.</strong> Focus your energy on important and solvable issues, ignore those that are irrelevant or beyond your control to improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t work too hard, let your money work for you.</strong> Put your money into the market and let it create wealth for you instead of devoting all your energy to work. Learn to utilize investment tools to achieve passive wealth growth.</li>
<li><strong>All pressure comes from expectations, and all worries come from not having a solution.</strong> Lower your expectations and actively seek solutions to relieve stress and anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to transfer pressure to those who can bear it and think about solutions for the worst-case scenario.</strong> Don&rsquo;t bear the pressure alone, learn to seek help, and think in advance about solutions to the worst-case scenario to calmly deal with challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain inner peace, focus on the important things, and ignore the insignificant things.</strong> Stick to simple things, don&rsquo;t get involved in complex things, to maintain inner peace and focus on what really matters in life.</li>
<li><strong>Account security is the primary issue in investing. Choose a large, reputable brokerage to open an account and avoid using online brokers.</strong> Online brokers have security risks, such as account theft and asset freezing. Choosing a large, reputable brokerage can better protect your account security.</li>

<p><strong>Dave:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
Shared the results of James&rsquo; TQQQ simulation backtest and raised the question of how to avoid the risk of a sharp TQQQ drawdown.</li>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
James believes that it is impossible to predict the market and avoid all risks completely. The important thing is to control risk exposure and avoid over-betting. If you are worried about the volatility of TQQQ, you can choose a more conservative investment strategy, such as QQQ. James also reminds everyone to distinguish between personal thinking and public advice, and not to be easily swayed by the thoughts of others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minjianlian:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
Shared his experience of investing in stocks through his company&rsquo;s savings association, as well as discussions about the MAGS fund and emergency funds.</li>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ol>
<li>About the MAGS fund: James believes that it is uncertain whether the MAGS fund can outperform QQQ in the long term. Investment should choose targets that have been tested by time, such as QQQ or SPY.</li>
<li>About emergency funds: James believes that emergency funds are a personal responsibility and government policies cannot be relied upon entirely. Everyone should prepare sufficient emergency funds according to their own circumstances to cope with contingencies.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Learn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
Regarding the performance of 00670L, James explained the performance difference caused by USD hedging and how to solve it by investing in QLD through sub-brokerage. He emphasized that Beta and ROI are different concepts. Beta represents volatility, not ROI. The investment model in Taiwan needs to be adjusted according to specific circumstances, such as  maintenance margin requirements and exchange rate fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>JJU:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
Shared his insights on market unpredictability and the importance of mentors and friends. He believes that investing, in addition to selecting good targets, is more about maintaining inner peace and enhancing one&rsquo;s spiritual level.</li>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ol>
<li>About the difference between reinvest and buy share: James explained the difference between reinvesting and buying shares. The former automatically invests dividends or capital gains into the investment target, while the latter uses new funds to buy shares.</li>
<li>About the fund ratio of Roth IRA and Individual Brokerage Account: It is recommended to maximize the Roth IRA limit if possible.</li>
<li>About real estate mortgage investment: It is recommended to sell the property if possible to reduce the risk of investing in real estate. Otherwise, consider a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) for investment, but pay attention to risk control and ensure that you can repay the loan on time. HELOC is a revolving credit line, similar to a credit card, which can be withdrawn and repaid at any time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Draft down:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
Proposed the possibility of leveraging 0% interest credit cards for investment and using the box spread strategy to increase capital utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ol>
<li>About credit card investment: James believes that credit card limits are limited and there is a risk of not being able to renew the loan, making it unsuitable as a main source of investment funds. It is only suitable for short-term turnover of small amounts of funds.</li>
<li>About the box spread strategy: James believes that the box spread strategy is too complex and risky and is not recommended for ordinary investors.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ol>
<li>How to overcome short-term pain in the investment process: James suggested lowering expectations, not pursuing perfection or getting rich quickly, finding solutions to problems, and transferring the pressure to those who can bear it, such as superiors or more experienced individuals. Think about solutions for the worst-case scenario, such as job loss or investment losses, and maintain a positive mindset, believing that the problem will eventually be solved.</li>
<li>About non-US tax resident investing in US stocks: James believes that non-US tax residents can use their passports to open brokerage accounts in the US without a Social Security Number. It is recommended to choose large, reputable brokers, such as Charles Schwab, and avoid using online brokers, such as Webull and Robinhood, as online brokers have security risks and imperfect regulations.</li>

<p>This session&rsquo;s theme focuses on the <strong>mindset and discipline of long-term investing</strong>. Teacher James&rsquo;s core message is that the vast majority of people (99.9999%) lack the ability for short-term market timing. Acknowledging one&rsquo;s own ignorance and holding for the long term is the correct path to wealth. He uses the &ldquo;Cave Allegory&rdquo; to illustrate the limited vision of short-term investors, emphasizing that the investment timeframe should far exceed one&rsquo;s working years. Successful investing requires overcoming the fear gene inherent in human nature, practicing &ldquo;anti-human nature,&rdquo; and abandoning erroneous asset concepts (like real estate worship) to ultimately achieve a &ldquo;life of hundreds of millions&rdquo; through disciplined investing.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Contradiction Between Investing and Working Years</strong>: People are willing to work for 40 years but view investing with the short-sighted perspective of a few days, months, or even a year. This is extremely irrational. The teacher sharply points out that this behavior means &ldquo;there&rsquo;s something wrong with their eyes, or their brain is flooded.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>The Cave Allegory</strong>: Short-term investors are like people living in a cave, satisfied with their own narrow cognition and making excuses for their poverty (such as claiming long-term investing is high-risk). No matter how you try to persuade them, it is difficult for them to step out of their cognitive cave; this is &ldquo;destiny.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>The Essence of Wealth</strong>: Wealth is a gift that comes automatically, but many people dare not accept it due to fear and a scarcity mindset.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Longevity and Investing</strong>: In the future, the average human lifespan may exceed 100 years. For those who don&rsquo;t invest, longevity is a tragedy; for those who understand investing, longevity means having more time to create enormous wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Compound Interest Calculation Examples</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Investing NT$10,000 (approx. US$300) per month at a 12% annualized return</strong>: Results in NT$9 million (approx. US$300k) in 20 years, NT$30 million (approx. US$1 million) in 30 years, and NT$100 million in 40 years.</li>
<li><strong>Investing NT$20,000 (approx. US$700) per month at a 12% annualized return</strong>: Results in NT$18 million (approx. US$600k) in 20 years, NT$60 million (approx. US$2 million) in 30 years, and NT$200 million (approx. US$7 million) in 40 years.</li>
<li><strong>Investing NT$20,000 (approx. US$700) per month at a 15% annualized return (like QQQ)</strong>: Results in NT$26 million (approx. US$800k) in 20 years, NT$110 million (approx. US$3 million) in 30 years, and NT$460 million (approx. US$15 million) in 40 years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: As long as one adheres to long-term investing, everyone should have a life of immense wealth. Even if you start at 40 or 50, you still have 40 years of investment time if you live to 90.</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wrong vs. Right Investment Duration</strong>: It&rsquo;s very strange that people are willing to take on a 30-year mortgage for a wrong asset (a house) yet use an extremely short timeframe to measure a right investment (an index fund).</li>
<li><strong>The Huge Risks of Real Estate</strong>: Houses face physical risks like fire, floods, earthquakes, and tornadoes, as well as quality issues like sea-sand concrete structures. Furthermore, liquidity is extremely poor, and job loss could lead to the property being auctioned off by the bank.</li>
<li><strong>Overcoming the Fear Gene in Human Nature</strong>: Our ancestors survived by running at the slightest disturbance while hunting. This DNA of &ldquo;running at the sight of risk&rdquo; has been passed down, causing investors to panic sell during market volatility.</li>
<li><strong>The Key to Successâ€”Go Against Human Nature</strong>: To succeed in investing, one must overcome this genetic defect and &ldquo;go against human nature,&rdquo; not treating money as money. You must learn on your own; listening to the teacher is important, but without self-study and practice, you cannot succeed.</li>
<li><strong>The Correct Mentality for Buying a House</strong>: There is no risk only when you can buy a house like you buy a pair of slippersâ€”if it breaks, you can easily get a new pair. Renting allows you to always live in the newest house, while holding on to a small, old, shabby one is meaningless.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Politics is for the Poor</strong>: The rich usually don&rsquo;t discuss politics; they focus more on studying and utilizing the rules of the capitalist system (like tax laws) to create wealth for themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Time Allocation</strong>: Spending time talking about politics reduces the time you have to manage your own assets. Instead of protesting on the streets, it&rsquo;s better to spend time on asset planning and tax-saving strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He and his nearly 20-year-old son studied Teacher James&rsquo;s course #00451 together and had in-depth discussions; the son showed great interest. He plans to open an account for his son with startup capital and set up monthly investments, allowing him to witness the miracle of compounding from a young age. He also wants to help his relatives&rsquo; children in a similar way to guide them towards financial freedom.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This is an excellent approach. Learning and discussing with your children is the best form of education. Teaching children about investing and financial management is more important than worrying about their studies or job. Once the problem of wealth is solved, 99% of life&rsquo;s difficulties are also solved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: Besides the 4-2-4 part of his asset allocation, he also casually invests US$1,000 in TQQQ every month. He worries that this part will become enormous in twenty or thirty years. If a major bear market like in 2000 or this year occurs, causing a 90% crash, how should he handle it? Should he just leave it there, or should he convert a portion to cash at a certain stage (e.g., upon reaching 10 or 50 million)?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Those who hold leveraged ETFs <strong>must perform a &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; once a year</strong>. When a leveraged ETF rises, you must move a portion of the profits (say, one-third) to cash. When it falls, you can use this cash to buy back in, which will actually improve long-term performance. Don&rsquo;t assume that holding without any action yields the highest return; one major crash can bring you back to square one. This operation is very important, or you will face the risk you&rsquo;re worried about.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2 (Follow-up)</strong>: Does this small monthly investment in TQQQ also need to be part of the rebalancing?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Yes. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how you invest each month. The key is to look at the total profit of the entire TQQQ account at the end of the year. Treat the monthly investments and the existing TQQQ assets as a single portfolio, calculate the total profit at year-end, and then perform the rebalancing operation.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: His wealth recently hit a new high, and he still feels excited, unlike the teacher who remains calm. He feels he still needs to cultivate his mindset. He believes this desire to celebrate shows he hasn&rsquo;t completely shed his attachment to gains and losses.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: He shared his observation of tourists at a restaurant (from Ukraine, Utah) who flew in for trivial matters. They lived happily but seemed to have no concept of investing. This made him reflect on how his own mindset still fluctuates with the market index.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: How can one cultivate a mindset like the teacher&rsquo;s, remaining completely unfazed by wealth growth?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: First, you must foresee your future wealth. Your assets will have two more zeros added to them, going from 10 million to 1 billion US dollars. When you have 1 billion, what&rsquo;s spending 200 million? You must learn to see your current wealth from a future perspective and learn to spend money. Second, pay attention to your health. He shared some personal dietary insights (e.g., oat milk raises blood sugar; don&rsquo;t be afraid to eat healthy fats and meats, but control carbs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: What kind of significant changes will the bill on digital currencies passed by the US House of Representatives bring to the financial market?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is a crucial step for the US to seize and consolidate control in the digital currency space.
<ol>
<li><strong>Regulate Stablecoins</strong>: Stablecoins like USDT and USDC are essentially digitized US dollars. The US must bring them under regulation (e.g., KYC) to maintain the dollar&rsquo;s credibility and hegemony. Otherwise, if tech companies are allowed to run wild and a collapse occurs, it will severely damage the dollar&rsquo;s reputation.</li>
<li><strong>Control Core Digital Assets</strong>: Besides USD stablecoins, mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have emerged. The US must acquire and control large reserves of them, just as it controls gold. Otherwise, in the future digital world, the dollar will lose half its influence. Trump&rsquo;s push to include Bitcoin in reserves follows this logic. In the future, Real World Assets (RWA) will also be on-chain, making it even more necessary for the US to control the underlying technology and core assets.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3 (Follow-up)</strong>: Would it cause chaos if other countries also issue stablecoins? If Bitcoin&rsquo;s price soars to an astronomical level, will it decouple from the US dollar?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: No. Other countries&rsquo; stablecoins are like their fiat currencies; they lack international usability and mainly circulate domestically. Globally, people will still choose stablecoins pegged to the US dollar. The essence of USDT/USDC is a &ldquo;digital US dollar bill,&rdquo; primarily used for large, fast transfers and to help people in third-world countries avoid the devaluation of their local currency. It has little impact on the average person&rsquo;s life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 4</strong>: Netflix&rsquo;s recent earnings were good, but its stock price fell. The market&rsquo;s interpretation is that this was due to increased overseas revenue from a depreciating dollar, not substantial growth. What is your view on the impact of this phenomenon on other global companies in QQQ?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: First, Netflix has risen nearly 90% in the past year, far outpacing QQQ, so its valuation might have been a bit high, making a pullback normal. The news interpretations are just post-hoc rationalizations; don&rsquo;t take them seriously. A 5% drop is nothing; a real plunge is a 20% drop at the open.</li>
<li><strong>Jumin&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This could be the financial circle manipulating stock prices for profit, a phenomenon of &ldquo;fleecing retail investors.&rdquo; The drop doesn&rsquo;t need a reason.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: He has been through two bear markets. The first time, he had no cash reserves, panic-sold at the bottom, and suffered heavy losses. The second time, he learned his lesson, held on, and his assets have now reached a new high. He has also started to build a 20% cash reserve. He emphasized the gap between theory and practice and the importance of overcoming bad habits.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: Using the Morningstar tool, he analyzed that from the beginning of 2005 to the present day, including dividend reinvestment, QQQ returned 16.5x, SPY 6.79x, and gold 6.3x. This data powerfully demonstrates that investing in technology (QQQ) is far superior to investing in the S&amp;P 500 and gold.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 3</strong>: He warmly invited Teacher James and classmates to visit Point Reyes National Seashore, north of San Francisco, offering to be their guide.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Regarding rebalancing, suppose the initial allocation is 70% QQQ, 10% QLD, and 20% cash. After a bull market, it becomes 75% QQQ, 17% QLD. At this point, if you only sell one-third of the profits, the cash percentage will not return to the initial 20%. How should this be handled?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: For retirees, the core focus is the <strong>absolute amount of your cash reserve, not its percentage of total assets</strong>. Your goal is to have enough cash to cover 15 years of living expenses. As your total assets grow, even if the cash percentage drops from 30% to 25%, it&rsquo;s fine as long as its absolute amount is sufficient to cover 15 years of expenses (or even more). Therefore, the purpose of rebalancing is to ensure you have a sufficient cash &ldquo;moat,&rdquo; not to mechanically maintain a fixed percentage. For young people, it is advisable to try to maintain a 30% cash allocation from the beginning.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: She feels very relaxed after adjusting her asset allocation to 80% invested + 20% cash.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Her husband&rsquo;s (Angel&rsquo;s) account makes up 1/5 of their total assets. She wants to configure this account with 50% vanilla ETFs + 50% leveraged ETFs. Is this advisable?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: It is not advisable to look at it separately; you should treat the family&rsquo;s assets as a single entity. Her current overall allocation is approximately 74% vanilla, 10% leveraged, and 16% cash. If they plan to retire, 16% cash may not be enough to cover 15 years of expenses. <strong>The correct approach is: first, set aside enough cash from the total assets to cover 15 years of expenses. Then, allocate the remaining funds to vanilla and leveraged ETFs proportionally.</strong> The cash reserve is the first priority.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: She detailed her emotional journey following the teacher&rsquo;s investment advice, from individual stocks to QQQ, and then to trying TQQQ. She feels confused and dissatisfied with the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s policies, believing they have caused unnecessary market volatility that has affected her TQQQ investment.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: With limited funds and in the wealth accumulation phase, how should one correctly handle TQQQ? She is unsure if TQQQ can truly outperform QQQ in the early stages and is confused about when to add more funds and how to rebalance.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Ignore Macro Noise</strong>: The Federal Reserve&rsquo;s policies, the economic situation, etc., are all irrelevant to our investments. Don&rsquo;t worry about them.</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Leverage Are Not Contradictory</strong>: Holding cash and rebalancing does not result in a worse long-term rate of return. By allocating a certain percentage to leveraged ETFs (like TQQQ/QLD), your total portfolio&rsquo;s Beta value (risk exposure) can still reach or even exceed 1.0, even while holding 30% cash.</li>
<li><strong>Discipline is Key</strong>: Don&rsquo;t try to time the market. When you have money, buy according to your predetermined allocation. Rebalance once at the end or beginning of the year. If TQQQ is profitable, sell a portion of the profits and convert it to cash. If it&rsquo;s at a loss, you can use a small portion of cash to add to your position (but be extremely cautious not to deplete your cash).</li>
<li><strong>The Risk of TQQQ</strong>: TQQQ takes longer to recover after a bear market. The risk is extremely high without sufficient cash and discipline.</li>

<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is an excellent question. The key to preserving wealth is to enhance your &ldquo;spiritual energy.&rdquo;

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: In Canada, there are multiple ETF versions of QQQ. In a tax-free account (TFSA), is there still a point in investing in a non-distributing version like HXQ?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Yes, HXQ is a good choice in any account due to its fee and tax structure advantages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: If my company provides a Defined Benefit Pension, can I consider it as part of my cash allocation in retirement, thereby eliminating the need to hold a large amount of cash?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: <strong>Absolutely not</strong>. A pension is a cash flow, not a large sum of cash you can withdraw at any time. If you face an emergency (like your house collapsing and needing US$500,000 to rebuild), the pension cannot meet that need. You must maintain a sufficient cash reserve.</li>

<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: I&rsquo;m confused about Beta calculation. Why does Yahoo Finance show QQQ&rsquo;s Beta as 1.41, while the teacher&rsquo;s system uses 1.0? How do I convert it?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Don&rsquo;t look at external data. Different systems use different reference points. Yahoo Finance usually uses the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) as the reference (Beta=1.0), whereas our system uses QQQ as the reference (Beta=1.0). It&rsquo;s just like using meters versus feet as units of measurement; the standard is different. Please use our calculation method: QQQ=1, QLD=2, TQQQ=3, Cash=0.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>You will only succeed in investing when you are not human.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: This statement was made by Teacher James when explaining why investing requires overcoming human weaknesses. He believes that the innate fear gene in humans (like the instinct to avoid risk while hunting in ancient times) is the main cause of investment failure. Therefore, one must &ldquo;go against human nature&rdquo; to remain rational during market fluctuations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I write a prescription for Lucy or someone else, you can&rsquo;t take it; you&rsquo;ll be poisoned.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: At the end of the course, Teacher James sternly warned students that asset allocation is highly personal. He emphasized that one cannot blindly copy the allocation ratios he suggests for a particular student (like 4-3-3 or 6-1-3). Everyone&rsquo;s situation is different and requires a customized plan; otherwise, it&rsquo;s as dangerous as taking someone else&rsquo;s prescription medicine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should have this kind of capability when buying a house&hellip; if the house collapses, I&rsquo;ll just buy a new one&hellip; If you would be ruined if the house collapsed, then why would you buy a house?
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When comparing real estate and stock investments, the teacher used this vivid example to illustrate risk tolerance. He believes that you are only truly capable of holding an asset when its loss would not cause a devastating blow to your financial situation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Politics is for the poor&hellip; The rich don&rsquo;t talk about politics; they only use policies to get rich.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: This point aims to illustrate that energy and time should be invested where they are most effective. The teacher believes that instead of spending time on political issues that one cannot change, it is better to study and utilize the existing economic and legal rules to create wealth for oneself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your wealth can only be as great as your spiritual energy is high.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When answering a philosophical question about how to preserve immense wealth, the teacher presented this core idea. He believes that the capacity to hold wealth is directly related to one&rsquo;s inner cultivation and spiritual realm, which needs to be continuously enhanced through learning, meditation, and other practices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slow is fast.
&ndash; Jumin</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: A student used this philosophical phrase in the comment section in response to the discussion about TQQQ, emphasizing that moving forward steadily and not taking shortcuts in investing is ultimately the faster way to reach the destination.</p>

<p>This session was a deep &ldquo;baptism&rdquo; into the investment mindset and discipline. With his characteristically sharp and direct style, Teacher James condemned the irrationality of short-term speculation and repeatedly demonstrated the necessity and superiority of long-termism from the perspectives of human nature, history, and mathematics. The &ldquo;Cave Allegory&rdquo; vividly depicts how cognitive limitations lead to poverty, while overcoming human fear and establishing a correct view of assets are necessary steps on the path to wealth. The Q&amp;A session was exceptionally active, addressing core investor pain points from the risk control of leveraged ETFs and the dynamic adjustment of asset allocation to cash requirements for retirement planning and the philosophical considerations of managing immense wealth. Ultimately, all discussions converged on a single core idea: <strong>Investment success is not just a victory of technique and strategy, but a comprehensive victory of cognition, mindset, and discipline.</strong></p>
