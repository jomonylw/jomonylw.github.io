<p>The core message of this lecture is that <strong>&ldquo;The Key to Successful Investing is Inaction.&rdquo;</strong> Teacher James emphasizes that investors should minimize decision-making and ignore all market noise, such as economic data, international situations, and interest rate hikes or cuts, as these are irrelevant to long-term investing. The correct approach is to do nothing after buying quality assets. However, the prerequisite for &ldquo;inaction&rdquo; is a deep understanding of market risks. One must prepare for the worst-case scenario (e.g., an 85% asset decline lasting for ten years). Only through rigorous asset allocation and maintaining sufficient cash flow can one ensure survival in this prolonged test.</p>

<li><strong>Course Number</strong>: The number for this sharing on YouTube is <code>00539</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Scam Alert</strong>: The teacher once again called out a scam account (ID changed to <code>James.James.1</code>), reminding everyone that he would never engage in any form of proxy trading, charge fees, or ask for money transfers. Anyone doing so in his name is a scammer.</li>
<li><strong>Munger Wisdom Video Recommendation</strong>: The teacher highly recommended a video (1 hour and 23 minutes) about Charlie Munger&rsquo;s life wisdom. The video focuses more on interpersonal, family, and marital relationships and life philosophy rather than just investing, and the teacher found its content to be very accurate and profound.</li>
<li><strong>Encouraging Content Creation</strong>: The teacher shared the example of a student, &ldquo;Wen Yan,&rdquo; who used an AI tool (notebooklm) to turn a two-hour lecture video into a ten-minute short, which achieved excellent reach on Xiaohongshu and Bilibili. The teacher encouraged everyone to use the channel&rsquo;s public materials for secondary creation and dissemination to promote correct investment philosophies.</li>

<li><strong>The Fewer Decisions, the Better</strong>: In investing, the most successful strategy is to &ldquo;make no decisions.&rdquo; When the market panics and everyone is discussing various macroeconomic issues, the best response is to ignore them.</li>
<li><strong>The Core of Investing</strong>: The most important and difficult thing in investing is to &ldquo;stay put&rdquo; after buying, which requires immense discipline. Any attempt to operate, change, or predict the market is almost destined to lower final investment performance.</li>
<li><strong>Practicing &ldquo;Inaction&rdquo;</strong>: The core skill to practice in investing is &ldquo;inaction.&rdquo; Your feelings are worthless in the face of the market, even &ldquo;garbage.&rdquo; You must be emotionless to invest successfully.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Duality of the Market</strong>: In the long run, the market will inevitably hit new highs (there is no highest, only higher), which is a natural consequence of human societal development. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean the market won&rsquo;t fall.</li>
<li><strong>The Inevitability of Extreme Risk</strong>: In an investor&rsquo;s lifetime, they will inevitably encounter an extreme situation where the market drops 85% from its peak, and this downturn could last as long as ten years.</li>
<li><strong>Qualification for Investing</strong>: You are only truly qualified to invest when you can face an 85% drop in your assets without a rebound for ten years, still adhere to the principle of &ldquo;never sell,&rdquo; and live a normal life. If you cannot accept the decline, you should not invest.</li>
<li><strong>The Only Antidote to Risk</strong>: The only way to combat this extreme risk is <strong>asset allocation</strong>. You must assume the worst-case scenario will happen tomorrow and allocate your assets accordingly, ensuring you have enough cash (e.g., enough to live on for ten years) to get through the crisis.</li>

<li><strong>Designed Laborers</strong>: Teacher James pointed out that the entire capitalist society educates the public to be diligent laborers, not capitalists. The financial system and government operations are essentially designed to make the masses work hard, pay taxes, and take out loans for housing, thereby tying them firmly to their jobs.</li>
<li><strong>The Trap of Traditional Financial Advice</strong>: Following the traditional path of &ldquo;work hard, save in the bank, buy insurance&rdquo; will ultimately lead to poverty. Savings are eroded by inflation, and money earned through labor and time can never achieve true financial freedom.</li>
<li><strong>A Shift in Mindset</strong>: The purpose of this channel is not just to teach how to get rich, but to awaken a &ldquo;capitalist consciousness.&rdquo; Once you establish a capitalist mindset, even without great wealth at present, you are already on the path to riches and can achieve inner liberation and happiness.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He has recently been studying Charlie Munger&rsquo;s wisdom in depth and advises everyone to listen to the views of wise people rather than getting caught up in whether the market is at a high point. He believes that in a bull market, investors should examine their own capabilities and risk control to avoid excessive borrowing.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Charlie Munger repeatedly warns against using leverage and borrowing money to invest. This seems to differ from the channel&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;pledging assets for a loan to invest.&rdquo; How does the teacher view this difference?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: What Munger opposes is the kind of leverage that could cause you to <strong>lose your freedom or go bankrupt</strong>. For example, a property developer who bets everything and goes bankrupt due to soaring interest rates, or an ordinary person who takes out a loan for a luxury house beyond their means to save face, ending up trapped by the loan and losing the freedom to quit their job. Munger&rsquo;s core idea is &ldquo;don&rsquo;t lose your freedom because of debt.&rdquo; The borrowing we advocate is based on extremely strict risk control: you must be able to assume that the stock market could drop to zero and stay there for 15 years, and you would still be fine. Only then can you borrow that money. This requires investors to have adequate asset allocation and cash flow and is not suitable for those nearing retirement. Therefore, the core spirit of both views is consistent: emphasizing survival and freedom in the worst-case scenario.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He mentioned that a legislator in Taiwan is recently promoting an investment plan for infants aged 0-10, where the government and parents would each contribute 4,000 TWD/month into an ETF.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This direction is correct, but requiring parents to contribute places a huge burden on young families, which is a flaw. He suggested a better way would be for all listed companies to increase their capital by 1% annually, inject these shares into a &ldquo;Taiwan ETF pool,&rdquo; and then distribute them to newborns. This way, neither the government nor the parents have to pay; the capitalists invest in the country&rsquo;s future, which would face less resistance.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: He believes the current AI development is just the beginning of a great era, far from being a bubble. He is willing to endure short-term fluctuations of 20-30% in exchange for potentially 10x returns in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: He shared his transformation from an &ldquo;employee mindset&rdquo; to a &ldquo;capitalist mindset.&rdquo; In the past, society taught us to pursue high income, then buy a nice car and a nice house, but this is actually a trap that keeps you working for capitalists. He shared how he once sold a luxury car and invested the 2 million TWD into an index fund, a decision that became one of the best of his life.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: There&rsquo;s recent discussion in Taiwan about calculating the supplementary health insurance premium based on total annual dividend income. How does this affect investors in high-dividend ETFs like 0056? What are the teacher&rsquo;s suggestions?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: First, he criticized the unfairness of this tax system, as it specifically targets vulnerable groups who rely on dividends, while capital gains are not taxed. He believes all income should be taxed fairly. Second, he proposed a solution: where there&rsquo;s a policy, there&rsquo;s a countermeasure. If dividend taxes or premiums become too high, investors can consider investing in US-listed high-dividend ETFs, such as <strong>JEPQ</strong> or <strong>QQQI</strong>, through a &ldquo;sub-brokerage&rdquo; service. The income from these would be considered overseas income, which has a high tax exemption threshold in Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>Follow-up Discussion</strong>: A student pointed out that dividends from products like JEPQ purchased through a sub-brokerage might be subject to a 30% withholding tax, and some brokers (like Cathay) do not assist with tax refunds. Therefore, the teacher emphasized that before undertaking such an operation, one <strong>must</strong> confirm the tax policies with their broker. If the tax is withheld and cannot be refunded, it is not a suitable investment.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He started investing in 2021, experienced a 20-30% paper loss but held on, and has now not only recovered but also seen good returns. This has built his confidence in long-term investing.

<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Helping those around you is great, but you must also know when to &ldquo;let go.&rdquo; For those who cannot be persuaded, don&rsquo;t force it.

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: He has seen families turn against each other over inheritance. He is puzzled why wealth can harm families and asked for the teacher&rsquo;s perspective on the phenomenon where the first generation strives, the second is harmonious, but by the third, disagreements and conflicts arise in wealth succession.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Property disputes usually happen when the heirs are in dire need of money. For them, any slight injustice is magnified. The most troublesome assets are illiquid ones like real estate. For elders who wish to distribute their assets according to their will, they must plan ahead while alive through <strong>trusts</strong> or <strong>gifts</strong>. Once a person passes away, everything can only be distributed according to the law. As children, the best approach is to follow legal procedures to avoid disputes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: He observed that even business owners work like laborers, constantly working and expanding. Others who are financially free dare not stop, feeling useless without work. Is this the result of capitalist indoctrination?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: As long as a person needs to go to work every day, even if it&rsquo;s their own company, they are still a &ldquo;laborer,&rdquo; and they even bear the risk of their own capital, which is a double risk. A true capitalist has no responsibilities and lets money work for them. This &ldquo;workaholic&rdquo; mindset is shaped by decades of education and work environment and is indeed hard to change. Munger also reminds us not to neglect family for the sake of making money, or you might win wealth but lose at life.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He shared the story of his 78-year-old American landlord. The landlord placed all 13 properties he built into a family trust, managed jointly by his descendants, to maintain family cohesion and wealth. He compared this model to the teacher&rsquo;s preferred QQQ model and marveled at how wise his decision was to sell his property and switch to QQQ, which has freed him from excitement or fear over market fluctuations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The landlord&rsquo;s approach was one of &ldquo;necessity.&rdquo; Holding a large amount of real estate presents problems like difficulty in division and high inheritance taxes. Setting up a trust for descendants to manage essentially turns them into &ldquo;laborers,&rdquo; bound by these properties for generations. If he had held QQQ, wealth succession would be much simpler, easily done through annual gifts, and his descendants wouldn&rsquo;t have to toil to manage the assets, allowing them to truly enjoy the freedom that wealth brings.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To succeed in investing, the fewer decisions you make, the better. Making no decision is the best decision.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: At the beginning, the teacher explained his core investment philosophy, emphasizing that in an environment of information overload and market volatility, maintaining &ldquo;inaction&rdquo; is the best path to success.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You must assume that the market will start falling tomorrow, that it will fall by 85%, and that it will last for 10 years. Only if you can still make your investments and asset allocations under this assumption&hellip; are you qualified to invest.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: When discussing risk control, the teacher proposed an extremely harsh psychological and financial test. Only investors who can pass this &ldquo;stress test&rdquo; are truly prepared.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Your feelings are garbage as far as the market is concerned. So in the market, don&rsquo;t talk about feelings. You should have no feelings to be able to invest.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The teacher sharply pointed out that investing is a rational domain, and any judgment based on personal feelings or emotions is worthless, or even has negative value, in the face of Mr. Market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In a capitalist society, everyone is educated to become a diligent laborer. The banks and the government essentially want to empty your pockets so you can work hard for the country.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The teacher offered a profound critique of the current socioeconomic system, arguing that it encourages people to become laborers who are then systematically &ldquo;harvested.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What Munger is talking about with borrowing is that you will lose your freedom&hellip; You must not lose your freedom because of borrowing, this is very important.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: In explaining Munger&rsquo;s opposition to leverage, the teacher grasped its core message—the biggest risk of leverage is not financial loss, but the potential loss of personal freedom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Saving is a very bad thing. So if you put your money in the bank, it gets thinner and thinner with inflation. How can you possibly become rich? It&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The teacher challenged conventional wisdom, pointing out that in an era of inflation, keeping money in a bank is tantamount to asset depreciation and is a major obstacle to wealth creation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As long as you need to get up and go to work every day, even if it&rsquo;s your own company, you are a laborer.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: When answering a student&rsquo;s question about whether a boss is a capitalist, the teacher gave a clear definition: a true capitalist makes money work for them, not the other way around.</p>

<p>This lecture, starting from the core investment philosophy of &ldquo;inaction,&rdquo; builds a complete system of investment thought. Teacher James not only emphasized the importance of long-term holding and ignoring noise but also spent a significant amount of time analyzing the most critical and often overlooked aspect of investing—risk awareness. He demanded that every investor confront the market&rsquo;s cruelest possibilities and build their investment portfolio based on that benchmark. In the Q&amp;A session, through in-depth interaction with students, the lecture&rsquo;s content was greatly enriched and deepened. Whether it was the interpretation of Munger&rsquo;s &ldquo;no borrowing&rdquo; wisdom, or discussions on wealth succession and tax planning, the session was full of practical guidance and thought-provoking philosophy. Ultimately, the lecture returned to a fundamental question: we invest and manage our finances to achieve true freedom, not to be enslaved by wealth.</p>

<p>This session delves into the &ldquo;Flexible Smart Rebalancing&rdquo; optimization strategy. Its core idea is to add a &ldquo;cash years&rdquo; criterion to the traditional smart rebalancing framework. When cash reserves fall below a preset number of years (e.g., 15 years), market downturns will no longer deplete cash. Instead, the underlying fund (e.g., QQQ) will be used to buy more of the leveraged fund to protect cash flow and enhance the portfolio&rsquo;s security. Concurrently, for retirees with higher cash flow needs, an alternative solution of allocating to high-dividend ETFs (such as JEPQ) is proposed.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strategy Background</strong>: This strategy was optimized and back-tested by student Peng, based on Teacher James&rsquo;s smart rebalancing concept, with the goal of increasing the maintenance rate (security).</li>
<li><strong>Core Mechanism</strong>: It introduces a customizable &ldquo;cash years&rdquo; variable (e.g., 15 years) as a threshold for switching strategies.
<ol>
<li><strong>When Cash Level is Below 15 Years</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>During a Market Upturn</strong>: Profits from the leveraged fund are moved into cash, with the goal of replenishing cash reserves to over 15 years as quickly as possible. Consider transferring 30%, 40%, or 50% of the profitable portion to accelerate cash accumulation.</li>
<li><strong>During a Market Downturn</strong>: <strong>Do not use cash</strong>. Instead, sell the underlying fund (e.g., QQQ) to buy the leveraged fund (e.g., TQQQ) to maintain the Beta value while protecting precious cash reserves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>When Cash Level is Above 15 Years</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The strategy reverts to traditional smart rebalancing. During a market downturn, cash can be used to buy more of the leveraged fund.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Strategy Version Evolution (1.0 vs. 2.0)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Version 1.0</strong>: The core is to reduce downside risk. During upturns, profits from the leveraged fund are converted to cash.</li>
<li><strong>Version 2.0</strong>: With sufficient cash (above the threshold), it increases upside potential. During upturns, profits from the leveraged fund can be moved into the underlying fund (QQQ) instead of cash. This slows down the decrease in Beta, allowing for the capture of more upside opportunities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Back-testing Conclusion</strong>: Data shows that under different Beta settings, the &ldquo;Flexible Rebalancing&rdquo; strategy, especially when using the appropriate version for different Beta values, generally provides a higher minimum maintenance rate than traditional smart rebalancing, meaning higher security.</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationship Between Beta and Withdrawal Rate</strong>: The recommended annual withdrawal rate varies with the portfolio&rsquo;s volatility (Beta):
<ul>
<li>Beta 1.0: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.0%</li>
<li>Beta 0.9: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.2%</li>
<li>Beta 0.8: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.4%</li>
<li>Beta 0.7: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.8%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Solution for High Withdrawal Rates</strong>: When the required withdrawal rate <strong>exceeds 3%</strong>, traditional asset allocation becomes riskier. It is recommended to introduce high-dividend assets to supplement cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Introduction to High-Dividend ETFs (JEPQ &amp; JEPI)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>JEPQ</strong>: Annualized dividend yield of about 10%. Approximately 80% of its assets are in QQQ, with the other 20% generating cash flow by selling covered calls. Its Beta is about 0.78, making it less volatile than QQQ and suitable for retirees needing high cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>JEPI</strong>: Annualized dividend yield of about 8.37%. It operates based on SPY and has a lower Beta of about 0.57.</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: These ETFs are primarily suitable for investors who are <strong>already retired, have insufficient principal, and are highly dependent on stable cash flow</strong>. They are not recommended for young investors still in the asset accumulation phase, as their long-term capital appreciation potential is far lower than QQQ.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Principles</strong>: Even if you don&rsquo;t understand the complex strategy details, grasp these key principles:
<ol>
<li><strong>Cash is King</strong>: If using a stock pledge loan, maintain a cash position of at least 30%.</li>
<li><strong>15-Year Cash Goal</strong>: Strive to maintain cash reserves equivalent to at least 15 years of living expenses as an important safety buffer.</li>
<li><strong>Beta Control</strong>: Keep the overall portfolio Beta below 1.0 to navigate market fluctuations smoothly.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Assets and Inflation</strong>: Stocks are real assets, and their intrinsic value is not eroded by inflation. When currency depreciates, the price of assets (stock prices) will rise to reflect their value. Therefore, do not sell quality assets (like QQQ) due to fears of inflation or short-term market volatility. Selling at any time is a mistake.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing:
<ol>
<li><strong>Inspiration for Flexible Rebalancing 1.0</strong>: It originated from Teacher James&rsquo;s mention that when cash is less than 15 years, one should not use cash to buy leveraged funds during a down year. Based on this, he conducted quantitative back-testing and tested different cash-year thresholds (13, 14, 15, 16 years) and the effect of transferring different percentages (30%, 40%, 50%) of profits to cash during upturns.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration for Flexible Rebalancing 2.0</strong>: Inspired by a strategy shared by student Lin. He pondered whether, when the cash position is sufficient, profits from the leveraged fund could be moved to the underlying fund (instead of cash) to slow the decline in Beta, thereby capturing more future upside potential.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Version 1.0 aims to &ldquo;reduce downside risk,&rdquo; while Version 2.0 builds on this to &ldquo;increase upside potential.&rdquo; He emphasized that the current back-testing period is limited and this is still his personal exploration, not to be taken as a final conclusion. However, the general direction is that a higher cash position leads to a higher maintenance rate.</li>

<li>Question: Why do you recommend withdrawing 2% annually instead of borrowing the full 20% of the pledge limit from the start?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a critical risk control issue. If you borrow 20% at once and the market experiences a major crash like in 2000 (an 85% drop), your assets would fall from $1 million to $150,000, but your debt would still be $200,000. you would go bankrupt immediately. By withdrawing 2% annually, even if the market declines for three or four consecutive years, you would have only used 8% of your total assets, and your assets would still be far greater than your liabilities, allowing you to survive the crisis safely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing: He observed that QQQ&rsquo;s annual return (23.29%) has surpassed VT&rsquo;s (19.92%), refuting an influencer&rsquo;s previous claim that VT would crush QQQ.

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Two things are especially important in investing: first, clarifying your investment Purpose, and second, setting a matching Target. The most dangerous situation is a mismatch between purpose and target. For example, investing with a mindset of entertainment (gambling) but expecting a stable cash flow or high returns will inevitably lead to disaster. Many friends around her made this mistake by engaging in all sorts of frantic trading during a bull market.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Very well said. It&rsquo;s like someone who does drugs and stays up all night but expects to be healthy—an impossible task. The actions of most people are contrary to their ultimate goals, but they don&rsquo;t realize it themselves. This is a lifelong tragedy.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your situation is excellent. Since your basic living expenses are covered by this $100,000 stable cash flow, you don&rsquo;t need to reserve that many years of cash. Depending on your comfort level, you can keep, for instance, 5 years of cash or 10% of your total assets in cash as a backup. The rest of your funds can be confidently invested in QQQ and leveraged funds.</li>

<li>Question 1: Most of her funds are in a US retirement account (a Rollover IRA from a 401k) and she was told she cannot use them for a stock pledge loan. This might prevent her from retiring early. How should she handle this?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a common trap. He does not recommend over-contributing to retirement accounts (like the Mega Backdoor Roth). The remedy now is: immediately stop contributing more money to the retirement account and focus all your efforts on building a personal brokerage account. At the same time, you should start converting funds from your Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA annually as soon as possible. Within the IRA, you can also allocate: put a small amount in a Roth IRA to buy TQQQ, so the high-growth portion is tax-free; keep the majority in the Traditional IRA holding QQQ or cash, which will reduce the tax burden during conversion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Are JEPQ and JEPI meant to be replacements for QQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Not replacements. They are tools for a specific group of people (retired, insufficient principal, need high cash flow). Those still in the asset accumulation phase should not touch them. The funding allocation order for retirees should be: 1. Meet cash flow needs (JEPQ), 2. Set aside an emergency fund, 3. Only if there is money left over, consider investing in QQQ for growth.</li>

<li>Question 1: In the event of future hyperinflation, which is a better store of value, real estate or stocks? Can the stock market withstand the test?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Stocks are assets. Inflation means money is worthless, but the value of the asset remains. At that time, the price of the asset (stock price) will rise to reflect its real value. Short-term market drops are due to human fear, not value destruction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Is the 10% dividend from JEPQ fixed? If the principal drops from $500,000 to $300,000, will the dividend also decrease proportionally?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Its dividend amount is relatively stable; it does not fluctuate strictly as a percentage of the principal. It&rsquo;s more like an annuity, designed to provide a steady stream of cash flow. So even if the market value drops, the dividend amount you receive will not decrease proportionally.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: It was because of a specific case: a 72-year-old student with only $600,000 in principal who needs $40,000 a year for living expenses. To help solve his problem, I researched high-dividend products and found JEPQ and JEPI to be relatively stable options. This is because they are not purely derivatives; they hold a large amount of real assets (80% index components), so they can be considered. This is to solve the cash flow problem for seniors, not a recommendation for the average investor.</li>

<li>Sharing: He shared the story of a 78-year-old relative in his family who is in financial difficulty due to kidney failure, requiring dialysis three times a week. He advised the relative to sell a piece of ancestral land that generated no cash flow and invest the funds into Taiwan&rsquo;s high-dividend ETF 0056. This would generate nearly 600,000 TWD in annual cash flow (50,000 TWD per month), completely solving her living expenses and allowing her to live with more dignity. He believes that the form of an asset can be changed; converting land into a stock asset that continuously generates cash flow can also be passed down to future generations.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: There is much suffering in the world, but the number of people we can help is limited. You gave excellent advice, but if she is unwilling to sell the land, that is her choice. We can only help those who are willing to be helped. At the same time, he also reminded everyone to protect their kidney health, drink more water, and stay away from junk food and sugary drinks.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>You think what you&rsquo;re doing is moving you towards your goal, but in reality, you&rsquo;re just moving further away from it, and you still think you&rsquo;re heading towards your goal. This is the most frightening thing.
&ndash; Lin</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote profoundly points out the disconnect between the actions and goals of many investors. They engage in speculative, trend-chasing, and other entertainment-like operations, yet expect to achieve long-term, stable financial objectives. Ultimately, they often end up going in the opposite direction, wasting precious time and capital.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stocks are assets&hellip; How much they sell for is determined by you, the asset owner&hellip; As long as you sell (QQQ), you are wrong. Selling at any time is wrong because you are selling too low.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to concerns about inflation, Teacher James emphasized the nature of quality stocks as real assets. Their long-term value will continuously grow, and short-term price fluctuations should not affect the determination to hold. Selling quality assets is equivalent to giving away huge future potential at a low price.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can&rsquo;t save the poor&hellip; 99.99% of people are fated to be poor, it can&rsquo;t be helped. So you should just&hellip; let go.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>While this statement may sound blunt, it reflects a reality in investment education: we can only influence those who are willing to accept and change. For family or friends who are stubborn and dominated by fear, it is better to let go and focus on one&rsquo;s own growth than to persuade them in vain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When people get old, if you don&rsquo;t have money, others might see you as a kind of &rsquo;lower-class elderly&rsquo;.
&ndash; Haoqing</p></blockquote>
<p>This point raised by Haoqing in his sharing very realistically highlights the importance of financial independence in old age. Having a stable cash flow is not just for survival, but for maintaining dignity, avoiding dependency on others, and being at their mercy in one&rsquo;s later years.</p>

<p>This session provided a significant optimization to the smart rebalancing strategy from a more refined and secure perspective, introducing the concept of &ldquo;Flexible Rebalancing.&rdquo; The core idea is to protect cash as a lifeline, preferring to exchange underlying assets for leveraged assets rather than easily tapping into cash reserves when they are insufficient. At the same time, the course demonstrated strong practicality by offering concrete and viable solutions, such as allocating to high-dividend products like JEPQ, for groups facing real-life difficulties (like insufficient retirement funds). Overall, this session not only deepened the theory of asset allocation but also closely integrated the practical financial needs of different life stages, once again emphasizing the core investment principles of long-term holding, risk control, and cash is king.</p>

By contrasting the vast difference between borrowing for consumption versus spending principal, he explains the wealth-magnifying effect of using leverage wisely. Additionally, for retirees and near-retirees, he stresses the core role of maintaining a cash flow reserve for over 15 years. Through two real-life family financial case studies, he analyzes the pitfalls of bank-offered wealth management products and how to make safer, smarter asset allocations for elders and oneself.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<lite-youtube videoid="XIN4vZYlGFc" playlabel="XIN4vZYlGFc" params=""></lite-youtube>

<p>The core of this session is to build an <strong>&ldquo;antifragile&rdquo;</strong> investment system. Teacher James points out that true financial freedom comes not from predicting the market, but from establishing a robust structure that can withstand and even benefit from market changes. This includes cultivating a long-term mindset that &ldquo;the market has no top, it will only go higher,&rdquo; and understanding that the permanent loss of missing out on gains is far greater than the risk of temporary downturns. Through specific examples and calculations, the teacher demonstrates the immense impact of using leverage wisely (such as credit loans, stock pledges) versus spending down principal on long-term wealth. He also provides clear guidance on cash reserves and asset allocation for different life stages, especially for those approaching retirement, aiming to help everyone evolve their investment cognition and achieve true financial security and freedom.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fearlessness Towards Market Volatility</strong>: Market shocks and international situations are irrelevant to long-term investors. The market has no peak; it will continuously set new highs. The biggest risk for an investor is not a short-term decline, but missing out on long-term growth due to hesitation, the latter being a permanent loss.</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Snowball Effect&rdquo; of Investing</strong>: The essence of Warren Buffett&rsquo;s &ldquo;long runway and thick snow&rdquo; is persistence. The initial years of investing (the first 4-5 years) may not show significant results, which is the most difficult stage. But once the asset &ldquo;snowball&rdquo; grows larger, the subsequent growth is astonishing. The key is to adhere to the principle of &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, and never sell,&rdquo; regardless of market conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of Scams</strong>: The teacher once again called out a scam account with the ID &ldquo;Pan,&rdquo; which impersonates him to contact students privately and has very few subscribers (35). The teacher emphasized that he would never initiate private contact with anyone, and any unsolicited contact offering managed account services is a scam.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Definition of &ldquo;Antifragility&rdquo;</strong>: Antifragility refers to a system&rsquo;s ability not only to withstand risks but also to benefit from drastic environmental changes and disasters.</li>
<li><strong>The Fragility of Professions</strong>: Many seemingly stable, high-paying professions, such as engineers and doctors, are actually fragile. The more specialized a profession, the harder it is to transition. Once a disruptive change occurs in the industry (like the emergence of AI), they may face the risk of unemployment.</li>
<li><strong>Investing is the Ultimate Antifragility</strong>: In contrast, capital is antifragile. It works 24/7 and cannot be fired. Therefore, everyone should evolve through investing to possess the ability to withstand unknown risks. The biggest risk in investing is &ldquo;the risk of not knowing that risk exists.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Thought Experiment</strong>: Assume you have a principal of $5 million with an 18% annualized return over 40 years.
<ol>
<li><strong>Borrowing for Consumption Model</strong>: Borrow $100,000 annually for living expenses at a 6% interest rate. After 40 years, the $5 million principal will grow to $375 million, while the total debt will be approximately $16 million. The final net worth would be a staggering <strong>$359 million</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Spending Principal Model</strong>: Spend $100,000 from the principal each year. After 40 years, the assets will only grow to <strong>$189 million</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In the long run, those who borrow to spend have nearly double the assets of those who spend their principal. The longer the time frame, the larger the gap. This reflects the hierarchical difference between being &ldquo;tycoon-level rich&rdquo; and merely &ldquo;wealthy.&rdquo; For young people, using credit to invest (like &ldquo;Han Xin gathering his troops&rdquo;) could add an extra hundred million to their future assets.</li>

<li><strong>Cash is the Cornerstone of Antifragility</strong>: An ample cash reserve means you won&rsquo;t be forced to sell assets during a market crash and can weather the crisis safely—this is antifragility.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamically Replenish Cash</strong>: In years when the market goes up, you should convert part of your investment profits into cash to continuously fortify your cash reserve. Survival is everything; don&rsquo;t chase high returns while neglecting safety.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Case One: The Trap of a NT$300 Million Land Plot</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: Land inherited from an elder appreciated to NT$300 million, but the family had no cash flow. A bank stepped in and designed a complex financial plan: mortgage the land for a NT$170 million loan, use part of the funds to buy high-risk bonds from an Arabian oil company, then pledge the bonds, set up a trust, have the brothers take out another NT$30 million loan, etc., in a layered structure.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: The entire family was trapped by the bank&rsquo;s scheme, burdened with huge debts, yet still generated no cash flow. Their assets faced a massive risk of being hollowed out by the bank.</li>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Advice</strong>: Immediately terminate the cooperation with the bank and redeem everything. The simplest and most direct method is for the elder to sell the land to a developer and get NT$300 million in cash. After taxes, there would still be about NT$200 million in liquid assets. This money could be allocated as 70% stocks and 30% cash. This would not only generate cash flow but also allow for easy handling of inheritance tax in the future through &ldquo;in-kind payment,&rdquo; avoiding being exploited by the bank layer by layer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Case Two: Financial Planning for a Near-Retiree</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: A 62-year-old friend with a mortgage-free house, NT$40 million in cash (later clarified to have total assets of NT$60 million), and annual expenses of NT$1 million, was considering a &ldquo;Wealth Management Mortgage&rdquo; (Home Equity Loan) for investment.</li>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Advice</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Strongly Opposed</strong>: For those near or in retirement, borrowing with a short-term wealth management mortgage (e.g., renewed every 2-5 years) is extremely risky. If the bank refuses to renew the loan and demands repayment during a market downturn, it would lead to catastrophic consequences.</li>
<li><strong>The Only Exception</strong>: If you must take out a loan, it must be a long-term one with a contract period of at least 15 years (for example, some banks like DBS offer loans until age 75). This is because a 15-year cycle is long enough for the market to recover from any low point.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion for This Case</strong>: The friend has NT$60 million in assets and annual expenses of NT$1 million, resulting in a withdrawal rate of only 1.67%. This is entirely sufficient for living; there is absolutely no need to take the risk of borrowing. If you have enough money, don&rsquo;t borrow. If you don&rsquo;t have enough, you shouldn&rsquo;t borrow either. Older individuals should prioritize being conservative.</li>

<li>Sharing:
<ol>
<li>As a 30-year-old, she shared her journey from having no concept of financial management to a complete mindset shift after reading and watching the teacher&rsquo;s videos. A project suspension last year gave her a lot of free time, during which she began exploring personal and spiritual growth and was introduced to basic financial knowledge.</li>
<li>She believes the biggest change was a &ldquo;shift in thought.&rdquo; Teacher James&rsquo;s philosophy, &ldquo;Wealth is a birthright, happiness is a human right,&rdquo; first requires establishing a new belief system. Many people don&rsquo;t believe ordinary individuals can achieve financial freedom because their old beliefs limit them.</li>
<li>She observed that the mentality of seeking quick results through short-term trading is rooted in the same &ldquo;sense of scarcity&rdquo; as the anxiety of rushing to find a job and being unable to tolerate career gaps. Stepping back and slowing down, however, can lead to more valuable methods.</li>
<li>After accepting the mindset that &ldquo;I am already a millionaire,&rdquo; she found her words and actions became more composed, and she no longer felt a sense of material lack. She believes that before learning the specific operational details, it is crucial to first mentally accept that one can be &ldquo;both wealthy and free.&rdquo;</li>

<li>He started following the teacher&rsquo;s lessons around 2019-2020. At the time, he believed in the philosophy but didn&rsquo;t have much capital. He owned three rental properties in the US, which had low cash flow and soaring maintenance costs after the pandemic.</li>
<li>Inspired by the teacher&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;selling the houses,&rdquo; he made a firm decision and sold all three properties within 22 months. Although he paid a substantial amount in capital gains tax, he viewed tax as a cost and felt a sense of relief after selling.</li>
<li>He invested the proceeds into a brokerage account, not getting bogged down in precise calculations but following the principle of being &ldquo;vaguely right.&rdquo; Last December, while traveling, he casually checked his account and was astonished to find his assets had reached 50 times his annual expenses. He decided to officially retire this year.</li>
<li>His takeaways are: be patient, as the market is generous; dare to sell rental properties; and continue learning, because the teacher&rsquo;s instruction is also constantly evolving.</li>

<li>Question: He shared backtesting data on an &ldquo;elastic rebalancing&rdquo; strategy. The strategy involves, when cash reserves are less than 15 years, not using cash in a down year but instead converting a portion of a standard ETF (like QQQ) into a leveraged ETF. In an up year, a portion of the leveraged ETF is converted back to cash. His conclusion was that the backtest didn&rsquo;t reveal a single optimal parameter. The most stable strategy remains, at the start of retirement for a given Beta value, to allocate the highest possible percentage to cash.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The conclusion is correct. For the same Beta value, always choose the allocation with the higher cash percentage. Rebalancing should be &ldquo;vaguely right,&rdquo; not overly precise. When the market is doing well, move more profits into cash to &ldquo;build your fortress walls higher&rdquo; to defend against future risks.</li>

<li>She discovered the teacher&rsquo;s channel in 2022 and took to heart the lesson, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay in a broken elevator.&rdquo;</li>
<li>At the time, her husband was day-trading in his retirement account, resulting in a $200,000 loss. He refused to sell, believing &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a real loss until you sell.&rdquo;</li>
<li>She eventually took matters into her own hands, sold all the stocks that were down 80%, and invested the entire amount into QQQ and TQQQ. In just one year, she not only recovered the $200,000 loss but also made an additional $80,000.</li>

<li>He has been practicing &ldquo;Han Xin gathering his troops&rdquo; by investing with credit loans and is currently approaching the credit limit in Taiwan.</li>

<li>Question: His mother is expected to have about NT$10 million after selling her house. Her annual expenses are not high, but the amount isn&rsquo;t sufficient to support living off a pledged loan. How should this money be allocated for his mother&rsquo;s living expenses? Is it feasible to invest it all in a high-dividend ETF like 0056?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I recommend keeping NT$1 million as an emergency fund and investing the remaining NT$9 million entirely into 0056. Assuming a 6% dividend yield, that&rsquo;s NT$540,000 a year, or NT$45,000 a month, which is much higher than rental income. This way, the elder has money to spend, feels secure, and will be happier and live longer. Moreover, converting real estate into liquid assets will make handling inheritance much simpler in the future.</li>

<li>Question: A 60-year-old friend has NT$7.5 million in cash and NT$18 million in high-dividend ETFs (yielding NT$1.6 million annually). Annual living expenses are NT$2 million. They are considering a 70/30 or 433 allocation and using a NT$7 million line of credit from a wealth management mortgage.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Absolutely not. First, your assets are insufficient to support NT$2 million in annual spending. At a 6% dividend yield, you would need a NT$33 million principal to generate NT$2 million in cash flow; your total assets are only NT$25.5 million. Second, you are already 60 years old; you absolutely must not use a wealth management mortgage, the risk is too high. Your only option is to keep about NT$1.5 million in cash and invest the remaining NT$24 million entirely into a high-dividend ETF like 0056. Live off the dividends, and spend only what you have.</li>

<li>Question: He finds leveraged fund rebalancing strategies a bit complex and worries if he can execute them strictly in his old age, or if he can teach them clearly to the next generation. Furthermore, when he does rebalance, he feels internal conflict, thinking, &ldquo;What if the market keeps going up?&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This method is not complex at all; what&rsquo;s complex is your mind. You struggle because &ldquo;your mind abides in something&rdquo; (心有所住), clinging to potential outcomes, which &ldquo;gives rise to inner demons&rdquo; (心生魔障). The solution is spiritual practice, to achieve a state where you can &ldquo;let the mind arise without abiding anywhere.&rdquo; This is just simple arithmetic; do what needs to be done.</li>

<p>&ldquo;Downturns are always temporary; only uptrends are forever. So your loss might be momentary&hellip; but if you miss out on the gains, that&rsquo;s a permanent loss.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This view emphasizes that in long-term investing, the opportunity cost (missing the upside) is far more detrimental than the paper losses from short-term market corrections.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The more specialized your profession, the more fragile you are&hellip; The only thing that is antifragile is investing.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This view explains the concept of &ldquo;antifragility,&rdquo; pointing out that highly specialized careers are very risky in the face of industry disruption, whereas capital investment has the inherent ability to continuously adapt to change.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The unfolding of our lives is actually based on our own mindset. Whatever you believe the world to be, that is what it will become for you.&rdquo;
&ndash; Mao Mao</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This insight shares the importance of personal mindset transformation, suggesting that believing you can be wealthy is the first step toward achieving financial freedom.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay in a broken elevator. We need to find a good one.&rdquo;
&ndash; TBOS (quoting Teacher James)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This metaphor illustrates that in investing, one should decisively abandon underperforming individual stocks (the broken elevator) and move to index funds with long-term upward trends (the good elevator).</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Tax is not the point. The point is that the assets should be able to appreciate, and the elders should be able to spend the money.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This point, made when discussing how to handle elders&rsquo; assets, suggests that the core goals should be increasing asset value and improving the elders&rsquo; quality of life, rather than being overly fixated on potential future inheritance taxes.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Because your mind abides in something, your mind is attached, and thus demons will arise.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This view responds to a student&rsquo;s concern about strategy complexity from a philosophical perspective, pointing out that fear and indecision in investing stem from internal attachments, not from the strategy itself.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The house collapses, but the mortgage payments continue.&rdquo;
&ndash; Fu You Shi Tian Fu &amp; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This statement, drawn from a real disaster case, reveals the immense risk of real estate as an asset. Not only can its value drop to zero, but the associated debt does not disappear with it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Usually, people who say they don&rsquo;t keep cash are the poor ones&hellip; Cash is air.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This vivid analogy emphasizes the critical importance of cash reserves for investment survival, especially in retirement planning, where it serves as a lifeline against risk.</p></blockquote>

<p>This gathering provided a deep dive into the core elements of building an &ldquo;antifragile&rdquo; investment system. From macro-level mindset to specific operational tactics, Teacher James once again stressed the belief and discipline required for long-term investing. By comparing the case of borrowing for consumption versus spending principal, he clearly illustrated the vast difference in wealth growth paths. For investors at different stages, especially near-retirees, the teacher offered prudent advice on cash reserves and loan risks, using two vivid family financial cases to expose the traps and enlightened paths in the financial market. The students&rsquo; sharings were also exceptionally insightful, ranging from transformations in personal journeys and the practical application of selling property to invest, to the integration of Zen meditation with investment philosophy, fully demonstrating the community members&rsquo; shared growth in both wealth and spirit. The entire discussion was not just a lesson in investment strategy but a profound exchange on life planning and spiritual cultivation.</p>

<p>The core theme of this session is <strong>constructing a robust asset allocation strategy for retired or near-retired individuals with &lsquo;survival&rsquo; as the primary goal</strong>. The central idea is that financial planning in retirement should prioritize the stability and longevity of cash flow over maximizing investment returns. Teacher James explains in detail how to set the portfolio&rsquo;s risk exposure (Beta value) based on different levels of cash reserves (30%, 40%, 50%) and, accordingly, determine a safe annual withdrawal rate. The aim is to ensure one can weather even extreme market conditions, such as a 15-year-long bear market.</p>

<p>Teacher James proposed three cash-based asset allocation models for retirees with different financial situations and risk tolerances:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>30% Cash Allocation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highest Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 1.0)</strong>: The remaining 70% of assets can be allocated as 40% in an index fund (like QQQ) and 30% in a leveraged fund (like TQQQ).</li>
<li><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate</strong>: With this allocation, a maximum of <strong>2%</strong> of total assets can be withdrawn annually for living expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.7)</strong>: If the portfolio consists of 70% in an index fund with no leverage, the withdrawal rate can be increased to <strong>3%</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: The higher the asset volatility, the lower the withdrawal rate must be to prevent excessive asset depletion during a market downturn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>40% Cash Allocation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.9)</strong>: The remaining 60% of assets can be allocated with a maximum of 30% in an index fund and 30% in a leveraged fund.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate</strong>: With this allocation, a maximum of <strong>3%</strong> can be withdrawn annually.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.6)</strong>: If the portfolio is 40% index and 20% leveraged, the withdrawal rate can be increased to <strong>4%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>50% Cash Allocation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.7)</strong>: The remaining 50% of assets can be allocated with a maximum of 30% in an index fund and 20% in a leveraged fund.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate</strong>: With this allocation, <strong>4%</strong> can be withdrawn annually.</li>
<li><strong>No-Leverage Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.5)</strong>: If the allocation is 50% cash and 50% index fund, the withdrawal rate can be increased to <strong>5%</strong>.</li>

<li>The most ideal state is to hold enough cash at a market high to cover living expenses for the next 15 years. Considering that cash itself earns interest (e.g., 3.5%), one might only need to prepare 12-13 years&rsquo; worth of principal to last for 15 years.</li>
<li>If this cannot be achieved initially, cash can be gradually accumulated through rebalancing when the market goes up until the 15-year goal is met or exceeded.</li>
<li>Only when cash reserves exceed 15 years of living expenses can the surplus be used to buy the dip during a market downturn, ensuring that &ldquo;survival&rdquo; remains the top priority.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investing is Learned, Not Taught</strong>: James quotes the concept of &ldquo;The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao,&rdquo; emphasizing that investment philosophy must be personally contemplated, understood, and practiced to be truly internalized. Like riding a bicycle, no amount of reading can replace getting on the bike and trying. He encourages everyone to use their hands and minds to explore and comprehend for themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Rethinking Stock Pledging</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Evolution of Concept</strong>: In the past, to avoid sacrificing returns by holding cash (used for pledging), it was recommended to pair it with leveraged funds. Now, the emphasis is more on &ldquo;stability&rdquo; and &ldquo;survival.&rdquo; Therefore, even without chasing the highest returns, a no-leverage portfolio of 50% cash and 50% index fund can still be used for a pledged-asset line of credit.</li>
<li><strong>Pledging Risk Warning</strong>: The teacher used an example to explain why even a seemingly low borrowing ratio (e.g., 10%) could lead to bankruptcy. Suppose you borrow $100,000 against $1 million in assets. During a prolonged bear market of 10 years (like 2000-2009, when the market fell 85%), the $100,000 loan plus interest could grow to $160,000, while your assets might shrink to just $150,000, at which point you would be insolvent. This highlights the importance of holding sufficient cash (e.g., 30%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow is the Lifeline</strong>: An anecdote about an individual with over 100 million TWD in assets who fell into a cash flow crisis after buying a 75 million TWD mansion serves as a warning that regardless of asset size, a lack of cash flow management can lead to bankruptcy risk.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: She started listening to the teacher&rsquo;s classes in April 2021. Although she&rsquo;s a slow learner, she has saved $100,000 in the past 20 months despite a modest salary, which makes her very surprised and happy. She has already reduced her portfolio&rsquo;s Beta from 1.3 to around 1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Her car is in poor condition. Should she spend $1,000 to fix it and drive for a few more years, or buy a Tesla to improve her quality of life? Although she&rsquo;s tempted, she feels she is still in the early stages of wealth accumulation.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: He advises spending the $1,000 to fix the car. Since her total assets are not yet substantial, buying a fifty or sixty-thousand-dollar car would be too high a percentage of her total assets. At this stage, she should continue to invest her funds. The teacher suggests she cleverly use credit cards, such as an Apple Card or American Express with 2%-3% cash back, and invest all the rewards into TQQQ, thereby &ldquo;getting richer as you spend.&rdquo; At the same time, he shared a personal regret. Due to his frugality, when he took his mother to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, she hesitated to take more dishes to be considerate of him, a memory that he later deeply regretted. Therefore, while buying a car is not recommended, one should not be overly frugal on crucial matters like showing filial piety to parents.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: After listening to a Buddhist dharma talk, she associated Teacher James&rsquo;s teachings with helping people &ldquo;escape the cycle of poverty,&rdquo; which filled her with a &ldquo;mind of reverence.&rdquo; She shared her recent action: she resolutely terminated a losing insurance policy, got back $24,000, and immediately invested it using the teacher&rsquo;s method. She believes that although it&rsquo;s a short-term loss, it&rsquo;s more important to cut losses in time and get on the right &ldquo;elevator,&rdquo; as she can earn it back in the coming years. She also began to ponder the deeper meaning of the teacher&rsquo;s emphasis on &ldquo;reserving 15 years of cash,&rdquo; understanding it&rsquo;s to ensure that one can both live without worry and navigate through a long bear market via rebalancing.</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: He explained the &ldquo;15 years of cash&rdquo; concept in detail. It is mainly for retired individuals with no source of income. The calculation is: annual expenses minus fixed income (like social security), then multiply the amount you need to cover by 15. For example, if you need to provide $50,000 yourself annually, you need to prepare $750,000 in cash. This standard is based on the historical experience of 2000-2015, where the market might have taken 15 years to return to its high. For those still working, they can dynamically replenish cash with their monthly salary and don&rsquo;t need to strictly sell stocks for rebalancing.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is a &ldquo;veteran student&rdquo; who has been following the teacher since 2011. He believes that new students today are very fortunate because the teacher&rsquo;s current investment strategy (indexing, long-term holding, automation) has evolved to its &ldquo;most perfect moment.&rdquo; He recalled that in the early years, the teacher&rsquo;s methods included individual stock picking and active trading. While it was possible to avoid major crashes, it was difficult for ordinary people to follow, and the after-tax returns were not ideal. Many old students missed out on the later, more optimized strategies because they didn&rsquo;t continue learning. He himself, based on the teacher&rsquo;s latest retirement calculation method in late 2023, found that he had enough to retire. He officially retired in January 2024 and now lives a wonderful life, with his investment income even exceeding his previous salary.</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: He thanked Dr. An for his sharing. He compared his early investment teaching to an &ldquo;expeditionary force,&rdquo; with heavy casualties and few who could keep up. Now, because online teaching doesn&rsquo;t allow for real-time command of tens of thousands of students, the strategy had to evolve into a &ldquo;space force&rdquo;—a fully automated model with no manual intervention. The pandemic accelerated this transformation. He praised Dr. An for not only keeping up but also implementing advanced operations like stock pledging and Roth conversions.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: With this conflicting mindset of &ldquo;wanting to accelerate&rdquo; yet knowing &ldquo;safety comes first,&rdquo; how should he adjust his asset allocation and mentality?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Since he is nearly 10 years away from retirement, he can absolutely adopt a more aggressive strategy. He can maintain a Beta of 1.0 and &ldquo;not rebalance&rdquo; for the next few years, letting his profits run. This might naturally increase his Beta to 1.3 or even 1.5. When he is about 5 years from retirement, he can start &ldquo;hitting the brakes&rdquo; by gradually increasing his cash position and reducing risk.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: At the age of 30-something, how can one better &ldquo;exchange money for spiritual energy&rdquo;?

<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The core of spiritual energy is &ldquo;vision&rdquo; and &ldquo;capacity of mind.&rdquo; You should practice a mindset: imagine you suddenly have 20 billion. If your lifestyle and mentality remain unchanged, then your spiritual energy is strong enough. True financial freedom is when &ldquo;money&rdquo; disappears from your life. It becomes like air, natural. When you consume, you no longer consider the price, only the value and experience. This is what frees you from trivial matters, allowing your spiritual energy to grow stronger.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is a new student who just found the channel two weeks ago and lost sleep for a few days due to the sheer volume of information.

<li><strong>Question</strong>:
<ol>
<li>If, after retiring and starting to withdraw via pledging for 3 years, his cash reserves reach the 15-year level, does he need to prepare 18 years of cash to be safe, considering the 3 years of living expenses already borrowed?</li>
<li>When the teacher retired at 42, did he already have the concept of living off a pledged-asset line of credit? What was the inspiration for this idea?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>No, it&rsquo;s not necessary. Because after a few years of market growth, your total asset size will be much larger than at the beginning. The growth in assets will be more than enough to cover the borrowed portion, making your safety cushion even thicker.</li>
<li>It was an evolutionary process. He didn&rsquo;t know about it when he retired; he discovered it later. In 2018, he needed money but didn&rsquo;t want to sell stocks and pay high taxes, so he proactively emailed his brokerage to ask if he could borrow against his stocks. The brokerage immediately set up a pledged-asset loan for him. He pointed out that this is a &ldquo;secret&rdquo; of the financial industry because regulations restrict brokerages from proactively marketing such banking services to clients unless the client asks first.</li>

If the market goes up, let your cash reserves naturally grow to, say, 20 years. When the market falls, use the portion above your 15-16 year baseline to buy stocks.</li>

<li>As long as you have sufficient cash reserves, a Beta over 1 doesn&rsquo;t need to be addressed.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: She plans to return to China in 6 years and understands that Hong Kong is the most favorable place for stock pledging. However, there is an annual foreign exchange quota of only $50,000, making capital transfer slow. How should she plan for this?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: First, pledging assets in the US carries risks for non-long-term residents, as the account could be closed. Therefore, gradually moving funds to Hong Kong is the right direction.

<li><strong>Mother</strong>: Sell everything and buy 0056 (a Taiwanese high-dividend ETF). Live off the dividends, and reinvest any surplus.</li>
<li><strong>Yourself and Husband</strong>: Sell all stocks (the 30+ holdings) and bonds. Create a portfolio of 70% 00662 (Fubon NASDAQ) and 30% 00865B (Cathay 20-Year US Treasury Bond ETF).</li>
<li><strong>Son</strong>: Just started working with a stable income. All spare cash should go into 00662. There is no need to hold cash at this stage.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-sale Home</strong>: The best strategy is to sell it as soon as possible after taking possession. If for self-occupancy, try to pay only the interest on the mortgage, not the principal.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Sub-brokerage Accounts</strong>: He recommends liquidating them all. Using Taiwanese sub-brokerage accounts to hold US stocks could face US estate tax issues in the future, and there is also the alternative minimum tax system for overseas income.

<blockquote>
<p>For retirement, what matters is cash flow, not rate of return. Return is secondary; survival is the most important thing.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This viewpoint was a common thread throughout the session and is the cornerstone of this asset allocation strategy, reminding retirees to place financial security above return growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. &hellip; The true Tao is the one you comprehend for yourself. Everything spoken is just the surface, the written words of a martial arts manual.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher emphasizes the importance of independent thinking and personal practice in investing. Knowledge must be internalized to become true wisdom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A peanut for your parents while they&rsquo;re alive is worth more than a whole pig on the altar after they&rsquo;re gone. (Taiwanese proverb)
&ndash; Teacher James (Quoted by Jenny during her sharing)</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher uses this vivid metaphor to stress that filial piety and care should be expressed while loved ones are still alive; their value far exceeds lavish memorials after they have passed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don&rsquo;t reduce volatility by changing your investment vehicle; you reduce volatility by holding cash. Low long-term return is the real risk.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>A concise point made by the teacher when answering his daughter&rsquo;s question, pointing out that the correct way to handle market volatility is to adjust the cash ratio, not to sacrifice long-term returns by choosing a less volatile asset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to first tell yourself that he is right, and I am wrong. &hellip; Why would someone who is wrong be so loud? This will make you reflect.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher&rsquo;s method for practicing patience, shared when answering how to maintain it. By first acknowledging the other person&rsquo;s validity, one can effectively de-escalate one&rsquo;s own emotions and achieve more peaceful communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never pay back borrowed money. This is very important. If you intend to pay back the money from a pledged-asset line, you shouldn&rsquo;t have borrowed it in the first place.
&ndash; Benson &amp; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Benson&rsquo;s sharing and the teacher&rsquo;s confirmation highlight the core essence of stock pledging: the borrowed money is a tool for living expenses or reinvestment. The goal is to ensure the cash-flow-generating asset is never depleted, thus &ldquo;repaying the principal&rdquo; is an incorrect operation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When investing doesn&rsquo;t exist, the market doesn&rsquo;t exist, and money doesn&rsquo;t exist, that&rsquo;s when your spiritual energy is at its peak.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher describes the highest state of financial freedom. When wealth is so abundant that one no longer needs to think or worry about money itself, one can attain true spiritual freedom.</p>

<p>This session was an extremely profound and practical lesson on retirement financial planning. Teacher James has evolved from his previous focus on &ldquo;the highest return under safe conditions&rdquo; to a more conservative strategy centered on &ldquo;absolute safety,&rdquo; providing a clear and actionable guide to asset allocation and withdrawal rates for those approaching or in retirement. Through the detailed breakdown of the 30%, 40%, and 50% cash allocation models, individuals in different financial situations can find a suitable &ldquo;survival&rdquo; plan. The numerous student sharings in the Q&amp;A session, from the &ldquo;then and now&rdquo; comparisons of veteran students to the &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moments and practical applications of new students, vividly demonstrated how this investment philosophy can change the financial destinies and life outlooks of different people. The entire session was not just a transmission of investment techniques but a deep exchange on views about wealth, risk, and life wisdom.</p>

<p>The core theme of this session is <strong>the flexibility of asset allocation and the survival rule for long-term investment</strong>. Teacher James emphasizes that asset allocation is not about rigid, unchanging numbers but should be dynamically adjusted based on an individual&rsquo;s cash needs, capital size, and risk tolerance. The central idea is that investors should first determine their cash holding ratio, which will dictate the risk exposure (Beta value) range of their portfolio and their sustainable annual withdrawal rate. For long-term investors, the most important goal is to &ldquo;survive,&rdquo; ensuring they can endure the long-term fluctuations of the market, rather than blindly pursuing the highest rate of return.</p>

</h3>
<p>Teacher James focused on explaining two pages from the handout on asset allocation, emphasizing their flexibility and core principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Cash Ratio Determines Everything</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your asset allocation should first be determined by your <strong>cash ratio</strong>, which will set the Beta value range of your portfolio and the percentage of your annual withdrawable amount.</li>
<li><strong>Basic Principle</strong>: The position in leveraged funds should not be higher than your cash position, nor should it be higher than your position in the underlying ETF (QQQ). For example, a 433 allocation (40% QQQ, 30% leveraged, 30% cash) is considered quite aggressive.</li>
<li><strong>Examples of Allocations and Withdrawal Rates for Different Cash Ratios</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>30% Cash</strong>: Beta range between 0.7 and 1.0.
<ul>
<li>With a Beta of 1.0 (e.g., 433 allocation), the maximum annual withdrawal is <strong>2%</strong>.</li>
<li>With a Beta of 0.7 (e.g., 703 allocation), the annual withdrawal can be <strong>3%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>40% Cash</strong>: Beta range between 0.6 and 0.9.
<ul>
<li>With a Beta of 0.9 (e.g., 334 allocation), the annual withdrawal can be <strong>3%</strong>.</li>
<li>With a Beta of 0.6 (e.g., 604 allocation), the annual withdrawal can be <strong>4%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>50% Cash</strong>: Beta range between 0.5 and 0.7.
<ul>
<li>With a Beta of 0.5-0.6 (e.g., 505 or 415 allocation), the annual withdrawal can be <strong>5%</strong>.</li>
<li>With a Beta of 0.7, the withdrawal rate should be reduced to <strong>4%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic Management of the &ldquo;15-Year&rdquo; Cash Reserve</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ideal State</strong>: Hold enough cash to cover 15 years of living expenses to safely navigate any market downturn and consolidation period, while waiting for the investment portion to double.</li>
<li><strong>Practical Application</strong>: If you don&rsquo;t have a 15-year cash reserve initially (e.g., only 10 years), you should adopt the following strategy:
<ul>
<li><strong>When the market rises</strong>: Convert profits from investments (especially leveraged funds) into cash to gradually build your cash reserve up to the 15-year level. Once the 15-year mark is reached, there&rsquo;s no need to add more.</li>
<li><strong>When the market falls</strong>: <strong>Absolutely do not</strong> invest your only 10 years (or less) of cash into the market. You cannot predict how long a bear market will last, and exhausting your cash too early will force you to sell stocks at a market low, leading to investment failure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Core Philosophy</strong>: The most important thing in long-term investing is <strong>to survive</strong>, not the rate of return. A slightly lower rate of return is acceptable; over a long period, your wealth will still be substantial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>Recognize the Nature of Financial Practitioners</strong>: There is a conflict of interest between bank wealth managers, insurance agents, and their clients. Their goal is to sell products, not to maximize the client&rsquo;s interests. Investors need to strengthen their own financial literacy and use the bank&rsquo;s services (like loans) rather than buying the financial products they push.</li>
<li><strong>Advice for the Elderly</strong>: Older friends (e.g., 70-80 years old) should spend more money to enjoy life rather than making asset growth their primary goal. With allocations like 505, 415, or even 316, the annual withdrawal rate can be increased to 5-6%.</li>
<li><strong>Be Greedy When Others Are Fearful</strong>: Looking back at the market bottom in October 2022 (QQQ around $260, lowest at $254), there was extreme panic in the market, but it proved to be an excellent buying point. Investors need to train themselves to remain greedy when others are fearful.</li>
<li><strong>Ignite a Capitalist Awakening</strong>: Teacher James believes that the essence of capitalism is the exploitation of labor and emerging nations by capitalists and developed countries through the system. We must learn their &ldquo;strong ships and powerful cannons&rdquo; of financial operations to change the destiny of ourselves, our families, and even our nation.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: My son is a senior in college and invests NT$1,500 monthly into 00670L (a 2x leveraged QQQ ETF). He just started two months ago. I&rsquo;m wondering if he needs to rebalance now, given the small amount, or at what amount should he start?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: With a small initial amount, just keep investing. When the market value of 00670L accumulates to about NT$1 million, he can start asset allocation, for instance, by shifting to a 433 (40% underlying, 30% leveraged, 30% cash) portfolio. As his salary increases, he can continue to invest and perform a smart rebalancing once a year at year-end. Additionally, the teacher encouraged young people, noting that they live in an era of rapid technological development where investment returns are higher than in the past. As long as they know how to invest, their future will be brighter.</li>

He fully agrees with the teacher&rsquo;s entire system (asset allocation, smart rebalancing, stock pledge) and aims to retire at 40 with NT$30 million. He quoted the ancient text <em>Discourses on Salt and Iron</em>: &ldquo;Wealth lies in strategy, not in physical labor; profit lies in market conditions, not in diligent farming,&rdquo; to affirm the importance of financial knowledge.

<li><strong>About Destiny</strong>: An astrological chart tells you your life&rsquo;s lessons and risks to be aware of, not a fixed outcome. A &ldquo;fate of solitude&rdquo; is a reminder to overcome this issue by making more friends and building good relationships, not by resigning to it.</li>
<li><strong>About Love</strong>: The core is to <strong>&ldquo;become someone worthy of being loved.&rdquo;</strong> Don&rsquo;t set conditions for your partner; improve yourself first to become that person. True love is unconditional giving (&ldquo;I do&rdquo;). Learn to listen to your partner and don&rsquo;t keep score. If you first become a person worthy of love, your partner will naturally love you.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He discussed Trump&rsquo;s proposed $100,000 application fee for H1B visas. He believes this reflects that America now needs the &ldquo;elite of the elite,&rdquo; as many basic jobs will be replaced by AI. However, he thinks that even if one cannot come to the US to work, it&rsquo;s fine. We can invest in QQQ/00662 and become the &ldquo;bosses&rdquo; of these American geniuses, which might be a better choice.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: First, he corrected the understanding of the policy, explaining that the $100,000 fee is mainly for direct overseas hires whom the company doesn&rsquo;t know, not for graduates who studied in the US. This actually benefits international students in the US. More importantly, he stressed the importance of philosophical thinking: before judging an opinion, first stand in the other person&rsquo;s shoes to understand why they say it, instead of immediately refuting it. Finally, he humorously taught him how to express love to his wife, starting with silently chanting it to himself as a form of self-hypnosis.</li>

<p><strong>Sharing</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Regarding the H1B news, he noticed that the Chinese-American community initially shared it frantically without understanding the facts. The subsequent clarification from the White House stated the policy mainly targets outsourcing companies. This validates the teacher&rsquo;s point that &ldquo;market information is garbage, ignore it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Learning financial literacy requires patience. <strong>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry.&rdquo;</strong> He observed that the pace of life in the US is slow and encouraged everyone to learn slowly, one step at a time.</li>
<li>Borrowing is a great tool, but it requires accumulated financial wisdom. When your capital is large enough, banks will chase after you to lend you money. At that point, you won&rsquo;t haggle over a 2.1% versus 2.5% interest rate, because your investment return will far exceed it.</li>
<li>He offered a brilliant analogy: <strong>&ldquo;Strive to become the &rsquo;eternal QQQ&rsquo; in your partner&rsquo;s words,&rdquo;</strong> someone they will hold for the long term and never sell.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Strongly agreed. &ldquo;Surviving is the most important thing, don&rsquo;t be in a hurry.&rdquo; He warned those who have suffered heavy losses in short-term trading or futures not to expect to quickly recover their losses using our method, as this is very dangerous. For those nearing retirement, he also advised against borrowing money to invest due to the high dual risks of repayment pressure and market volatility.</li>

<li>I&rsquo;m interested in Zi Wei Dou Shu (Chinese astrology). What do the stars &ldquo;Di Kong&rdquo; and &ldquo;Di Jie&rdquo; in the self-palace represent? And is &ldquo;synastry&rdquo; (comparing charts) for couples useful for determining fate?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Allocate the money after it arrives.</strong> Don&rsquo;t act in advance, as anything can happen in the process. There&rsquo;s no need to predict.</li>
<li><strong>About Astrological Charts</strong>: Don&rsquo;t worry too much about minor stars like Di Kong and Di Jie. The most critical thing to look at is which palace the &ldquo;Huà Jì&rdquo; (Transforming Envy/Doom) star is in. Huà Jì represents your life&rsquo;s lesson and weakness, something you need to work hard to overcome, not your destiny. For example, if Huà Jì is in the marriage palace, it&rsquo;s a reminder to put effort into managing your marital relationship. Looking at your partner&rsquo;s chart is not for &ldquo;synastry&rdquo; but to understand their weaknesses and challenges, thereby fostering more empathy.</li>

<li><strong>A feasible method</strong>: You can suggest they start with a small amount of money they can afford to lose and explain the long-term nature of it. You could even verbally promise that if they still have a loss after ten years, you&rsquo;ll cover it.</li>

This fully demonstrated that the learning atmosphere of the CLEC community has transcended mere investment management, entering a higher level where investment philosophy is integrated into all aspects of life.

<ul>
<li>Teacher James begins with the experience of a friend&rsquo;s family, strongly urging everyone to prioritize health, especially the early screening for lung cancer.</li>
<li><strong>Core Recommendation</strong>: Friends over 40 in Taiwan should pay for a low-dose computed tomography (Low-Dose CT, LDCT) scan out-of-pocket (around NT$5,000-6,000). Lung cancer is the &ldquo;king of cancers&rdquo; in Taiwan, often asymptomatic in its early stages, but the cure rate is high with early detection.</li>
<li><strong>Screening Frequency</strong>: If the scan is clear, you can do it again every 2-3 years. The latency period for lung adenocarcinoma is relatively long; it might take five years for a tumor to grow from 0.8 cm to 1.6 cm, providing enough time to respond with regular follow-ups.</li>
<li><strong>Added Value</strong>: An LDCT scan can also incidentally check for calcification or blockage in the heart&rsquo;s coronary arteries, serving two purposes at once.</li>
<li><strong>Advice for Overseas Chinese</strong>: For Chinese friends in the United States, since doctors there typically do not order such scans without symptoms, you might consider booking a self-paid health check-up at a teaching hospital in Taiwan a month and a half in advance when you travel back.</li>
<li><strong>Health is Fundamental</strong>: The teacher emphasizes that without health, all wealth is meaningless.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore Currency Fluctuations</strong>: Taking the 00662 fund as an example, although it is a USD-denominated product priced in TWD, its net value is affected by the TWD/USD exchange rate. However, over the long term (e.g., 30 years), the impact of exchange rates will smooth out. Investors should completely ignore currency fluctuations and focus on the growth of the asset itself.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Away from Wrong Products</strong>: Young people should not invest in high-dividend products, as they will only make you poorer. Also, be wary of insurance, annuities, and similar products, which the teacher calls &ldquo;products from a scam syndicate.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Adhere to Index Funds</strong>: It is only recommended to invest in broad-based index funds like the Nasdaq-100 (e.g., QQQ, 00662). Don&rsquo;t be misled by other ETFs on the market that are not true to their name.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Critique of &ldquo;Involution&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hardship&rdquo; Culture</strong>: The prevalent cultures of &ldquo;treating hardship as a tonic&rdquo; and &ldquo;involution&rdquo; in Asian societies lead to an increasingly difficult life for everyone. The teacher advocates for learning from Western thinking, realizing that we are not born to be laborers or slaves.</li>
<li><strong>The Intent Behind the Word &ldquo;Slave&rdquo;</strong>: The teacher deliberately uses the word &ldquo;slave&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;laborer&rdquo; to make the audience uncomfortable and thus spark an awakening. Under modern capitalism, apart from capitalists, most people are essentially &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; serving capital, to be discarded after use.</li>
<li><strong>Breaking Out of Mental Frameworks</strong>: Escaping inherent societal beliefs like &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t have food if you don&rsquo;t work hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;investing is wrong&rdquo; is harder than making the right investment itself. One must resist the negative influence of friends and family and stick to one&rsquo;s own path.</li>
<li><strong>True Freedom</strong>: Financial freedom is just the first step. True freedom is the ability to ignore the judgment of society and others, to grade yourself, and to live the life you want. You decide how you want to spend your money and what kind of life you want to live—that is freedom.</li>
<li><strong>Warning of Survivorship Bias</strong>: The teacher admits that his ability to make money in his first 20 years of speculation was due to &ldquo;heaven&rsquo;s mercy&rdquo; and &ldquo;luck,&rdquo; a case of survivorship bias that is not replicable. He strongly advises against imitating it.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalism and Inequality</strong>: The development of civilization has created information gaps, which are the root of inequality. Capitalism uses information asymmetry to create unfairness, which is essentially plunder. The teacher compares human conflicts to &ldquo;watching two groups of gorillas fighting,&rdquo; illustrating that human civilization has not progressed much in its essence; slavery exists today in a new form and on a larger scale.</li>
<li><strong>A Revolution to Eliminate Poverty</strong>: Teacher James sees his educational sharing as a &ldquo;revolution to eliminate poverty,&rdquo; aimed at awakening the masses to understand the rules of capitalism and transform from exploited &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; to &ldquo;masters&rdquo; who use the rules to their advantage.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation Principles</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Condition for Retirement: Assets reach 50 times annual expenses.</li>
<li>Retirement Allocation: Cash should be at least 30%, enough to cover more than 15 years of annual expenses.</li>
<li>Beta Value: The Beta of the initial allocation should not exceed 1.0.</li>
<li>Leveraged Funds: The position in leveraged funds should not exceed the cash position, nor should it exceed the position in the underlying fund.</li>
<li>Flexible Allocation: Besides the 4-3-3 model, configurations like 70/30, 60/40, and 50/50 are all viable. The key is to find what suits your own risk tolerance and cash flow needs.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>No Shortcuts in Investment Learning</strong>: Investment knowledge requires systematic learning and cannot be achieved overnight. You must connect the scattered &ldquo;dots&rdquo; of knowledge into &ldquo;lines,&rdquo; which then form a &ldquo;surface&rdquo; and a &ldquo;three-dimensional&rdquo; knowledge system through continuous watching of videos (e.g., starting from #398) and note-taking.</li>

<li><strong>The Revolutionary Nature of Agents</strong>: Taking OpenAI&rsquo;s Agent functionality as an example, future AI agents will be able to automatically complete complex tasks like booking tickets, shopping, and planning itineraries.

<li><strong>Share</strong>: After attending the class in January 2024, I transferred my entire 401k to a brokerage account and invested it all at once. The market was down at the time, and my assets grew from $1.1 million to the current $1.7 million. My current asset allocation is 50% QQQ, 20% TQQQ.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: When I retire, should I convert the TQQQ to QQQ?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The focus isn&rsquo;t on TQQQ. The goal is to get your brokerage account funds to exceed $1 million so you can do stock pledges in the future. Your current tax rate is between 30-33%, so you should immediately start converting funds from your Traditional 401k/IRA to a Roth IRA in batches. Since your assets will be much higher in the future, a one-time conversion would face an extremely high tax bill. It&rsquo;s recommended to convert a portion each year, for example, $100,000 at a time (Note: a student pointed out that at a 30% tax rate, converting $100k would cost $30k in taxes, so be prepared). Strategically, you should place leveraged funds (like TQQQ) in the tax-free Roth account, while leaving cash in the Traditional account to slow its growth.</li>

<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The higher your position, the more relaxed you should be. If you&rsquo;re more tired, it means your management skills are lacking. The key is to learn to delegate and &ldquo;throw the monkeys,&rdquo; meaning you assign tasks to your subordinates to complete, and you only check and guide at critical points. Don&rsquo;t take the pressure from your superiors seriously; treat it as &ldquo;wind in your ears&rdquo; or a &ldquo;dog barking at a train.&rdquo; Your core job is to enhance your subordinates&rsquo; abilities and make them stronger than you, so you can truly &ldquo;work while lying down.&rdquo; When your boss scolds you, take a deep breath; that&rsquo;s his problem, don&rsquo;t let it affect your mood.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: Can the CT scan you mentioned also detect problems with other organs like the pancreas?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: LDCT mainly targets the lungs. While it can also scan the liver, its effectiveness for pancreatic cancer screening is uncertain. For a full-body cancer cell screening, you need a PET Scan, but it has high radiation and is usually only for diagnosed cancer patients to check for metastasis.

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: In the smart rebalancing strategy, do you ever rebalance the underlying fund (like QQQ)?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Yes, the underlying fund is never touched.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: If the market crashes and then rebounds, and the leveraged fund (like TQQQ) rises for the year but its total asset percentage has not returned to the initially set ratio (e.g., target 30%, now up from 20% to 28%), do I still need to sell one-third of the gains?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: You must sell. If you don&rsquo;t take out cash in a rising year and keep using cash to buy in a falling year, your cash reserves will be depleted quickly. Even if the leveraged fund hasn&rsquo;t returned to its previous high, as long as it has risen for the year, you must take out a portion of the profit (one-third of the gain) to replenish your cash. This is a critical risk control mechanism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: Besides living expenses, buying dips, and margin for pledges, does cash have other uses? I feel like a 30% cash allocation might be too high for me.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: 30% cash corresponds to 15 years of living expenses (calculated at a 2% annual withdrawal rate), which is a robust initial setting. If your pledged loans increase, your cash reserves need to increase accordingly to cover the debt risk. If you have other stable income (like social security, rent), you can continue to invest that income instead of reducing your cash reserve. Maintaining a 15-year cash reserve is a simple and effective strategy.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: I read Professor Chou&rsquo;s book, which mentioned not recommending long-term holding of leveraged ETFs because their value erodes over time and the long-term return is not double. This differs from your view. How should I understand this?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The annualized return of a leveraged fund is indeed not a linear double (e.g., if QQQ has a 10% annualized return, TQQQ might only be 14%), but due to the compounding effect, the total asset growth multiplier after 20 years will be far more than double. The reason Professor Chou doesn&rsquo;t recommend it is that he is addressing the general public and cannot teach complex asset allocation in depth. Holding leveraged funds is indeed very dangerous without asset allocation (i.e., without cash to buy on dips). Our method is built on strict asset allocation, which is the fundamental difference. These things can only be taught in a small, in-depth learning class; if you say this in the mass media, you&rsquo;ll be &ldquo;drowned in saliva.&rdquo;</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: The market is hitting new highs, and I have the impulse to sell some of my QLD to lock in profits and increase cash. Should I do it now or wait until the end of the year?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Wait until the end of the year. The market&rsquo;s gain so far this year is not that large (about 10%). A normal bull year should see a rise of 30% or more. Only when there is a huge deviation (like a 50% annual gain) is there a need to consider adjusting early. Otherwise, just rebalance annually.</li>

<li><strong>Share &amp; Question 2</strong>: I shared a strategy from a research paper, which is to sell leveraged funds when the index falls below the 200-day moving average (MA200) and buy back when it rises above it, claiming it can significantly improve returns. I did my own simulation and it seemed to work well. I&rsquo;d like to hear your thoughts.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This kind of market-timing strategy is useless. First, you&rsquo;ll encounter many &ldquo;whipsaws&rdquo; (false breakouts), leading to losses from selling high and buying low. Second, even if you successfully sell at the top (like in 2000), the biggest problem is when to buy back; human nature makes it very difficult. This operation seems clever, but its actual effect is often worse than the simple and effective &ldquo;hold and buy the dip&rdquo; strategy. We rely on asset allocation and cash reserves, not market timing.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: I have two children (one in college, one just started working), and they each have over 5 million TWD in assets. Should they invest directly in an underlying fund (00662) or use a 4-3-3 allocation?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: You must allocate cash for them. They are about to become independent and need their own emergency fund. You can&rsquo;t let them rely on their parents for everything. I suggest starting with an 80/20 (underlying/cash) allocation and don&rsquo;t use leveraged funds yet. Once they get used to investing, you can slowly add a small amount of leverage in the future. Don&rsquo;t let them experience large fluctuations from the start, as it might leave them with psychological scars.</li>

<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: It seems that Taiwan&rsquo;s leveraged fund (00670L) recovers slower than America&rsquo;s QLD. Is there a problem with its management?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is mainly due to the TWD exchange rate and hedging costs. The correct comparison is between 00670L and 00662, as they are both priced in TWD. Historical data shows that the return of 00670L is more than double that of 00662, proving it has met its design objective.</li>

Don&rsquo;t worry about how much you&rsquo;ve lost, because you still have decades of investing time ahead of you. Even if you only get a small amount back, investing it in an index fund will grow into a huge fortune after 40 years, far exceeding your current losses.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: I started investing in my second year of work, so I was both a laborer and a capitalist. The key is that you must find a meaning and mission for your work that goes beyond the salary. My mission at that time was to design stable and reliable computers to serve the public.

Asset allocation requires understanding your entire situation: age, family status (single/married/children), total annual expenses, whether you have a sufficient emergency fund, and whether this 200,000 is spare money. Without this information, it&rsquo;s impossible to give responsible advice. If this 200,000 is money you won&rsquo;t touch for 15-20 years and you already have an adequate emergency fund, then you can buy QQQ or 00662 all at once.</li>

<p>This session begins with an important reminder about health management, emphasizing the &ldquo;health first&rdquo; philosophy. The core content revolves around the &ldquo;mindset awakening&rdquo; of investors. Teacher James profoundly analyzes the difference in mentality between a &ldquo;slave&rdquo; and a &ldquo;master&rdquo; within the capitalist system, encouraging students to become masters of capital by investing in index funds long-term and breaking free from the shackles of working for money. At the same time, he teaches everyone to ignore external judgments and pursue genuine, heartfelt freedom and happiness. The Q&amp;A session was rich in content, covering various aspects from retirement asset allocation, use of leveraged funds, and tax planning to professional mindset adjustment, providing extremely valuable practical guidance for investors at different stages.</p>

<p>This session revolves around &ldquo;The Long-term Practice of Investment Mindset and Asset Allocation.&rdquo; The core message is that investors should cultivate a transcendent mindset of &ldquo;it has nothing to do with me,&rdquo; remaining calm in the face of external factors like international situations and economic data, and firmly believing that the market will trend upwards and reach new highs in the long run. It emphasizes achieving financial freedom through reasonable asset allocation (e.g., Nasdaq 100 index funds combined with ample cash) and passive management, and drawing strength for life and investment from wisdom such as &ldquo;I might be wrong&rdquo; and &ldquo;life is worthwhile.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Market Irrelevance Theory</strong>: Macro factors like international situations, financial reports, economic data, and interest rate decisions have no direct correlation with an individual investor&rsquo;s long-term success. One should adopt a mindset of &ldquo;it all has nothing to do with me.&rdquo; Market volatility is normal and not worth worrying about, as you can&rsquo;t control it anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Always Be Extremely Optimistic</strong>: Firmly believe that the market will inevitably rise and set new historical highs in the long run. Investing requires patience, and wealth is worth the trouble and the wait.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended Books/Films for the Mind</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>&ldquo;I Might Be Wrong&rdquo;</strong> (The Illumination of a Forest Sage): This book recounts the life insights of a man (from Europe, as the teacher recalls) who spent over a decade (perhaps 14 or 16 years) as a monk in a Thai forest. The core takeaway is to tell yourself &ldquo;I might be wrong&rdquo; three times before arguing or getting angry, to calm your mind and self-reflect. It emphasizes practicing the state of &ldquo;no-self&rdquo; and learning to live harmoniously with all kinds of people.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Life is Worthwhile&rdquo;</strong> (Audiobook): This book contains the professional insights and life experiences of an elderly female Japanese psychiatrist. Through numerous patient cases, it explores how many psychological barriers stem from &ldquo;attachment.&rdquo; Her life experiences (e.g., maintaining a less-than-perfect marriage until her husband passed away in his 70s so that both parents could stand on the stage at their children&rsquo;s weddings) are thought-provoking. The core message is to let go of attachments and appreciate life. The teacher believes that, aside from the somewhat fatalistic view on marriage, the book is very beneficial for one&rsquo;s outlook on life.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Boredom is the Highest State</strong>: &ldquo;Hold stocks in your hand, but not their prices in your heart.&rdquo; True investing should be boring, requiring only 5 minutes of operation and review each year. If it feels exciting, you&rsquo;re likely speculating or gambling, as if you&rsquo;re in Las Vegas.</li>
<li><strong>Coping with Anxiety</strong>: Don&rsquo;t create your own troubles in life. If you can handle something, face it and get it done. If you can&rsquo;t, since it&rsquo;s beyond your control, let it go without worry.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Importance of Cash is King</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>For Retirees</strong>: It&rsquo;s recommended to hold total assets equivalent to 50 times your annual expenses. Of this, 30% of your assets (equivalent to 15 years of living expenses) should be held in cash or short-term treasury bonds. With 15 years of living expenses in cash, nothing in the world concerns you.</li>
<li><strong>For Working Individuals</strong>: You usually can&rsquo;t hold 15 years&rsquo; worth of cash. You should continue to save and invest, and the world&rsquo;s affairs also have nothing to do with you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Ultimate Perspective of Life</strong>: In life-or-death moments (like the last day of your life), wealth, stock losses, and asset security become irrelevant. Therefore, don&rsquo;t worry excessively about things you can&rsquo;t control in daily life.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Asset Allocation Principles (Pledged Investing)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Beta Control</strong>: The initial Beta of your asset allocation should not exceed 1.0. For example, a 40% non-leveraged fund (QQQ) + 30% leveraged fund (QLD) + 30% cash (433 allocation) is an aggressive setup. A 40% QQQ + 20% QLD + 40% cash (424 allocation, Beta 0.8) is also a solid choice. Aggressive allocations like 442, where the Beta might exceed 1.2, are not recommended at the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Proportion Limits</strong>: The market value of the leveraged fund should not exceed that of the non-leveraged fund, nor should it exceed the cash position.</li>
<li><strong>Prudent Choices</strong>: Even without using leveraged funds, a pledged allocation like 70% QQQ + 30% cash, or 60% QQQ + 40% cash, can withstand risk tests. Prioritize stability, with returns being secondary.</li>
<li><strong>Coping with Extreme Scenarios</strong>: This allocation must be able to withstand a market downturn lasting 10 years, like the one in 2000 (in reality, it took about 13-15 years for the market to fully recover and significantly surpass its previous high).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Role of Cash</strong>: Cash is key to protecting the safety of your long-term investments (the &ldquo;army&rdquo; of non-leveraged funds and the &ldquo;marines&rdquo; of leveraged funds).</li>
<li><strong>The Worst-Case Scenario Principle</strong>: Envision the worst possible situation and create a plan to deal with it. Once you have a solution, anxiety will diminish. For example, if you get laid off, the worst case is being unable to find a job for a year. Plan how to prepare funds and how to find a temporary job for cash flow. For disasters beyond your control that you can&rsquo;t prevent (like a nuclear war, as Buffett mentioned, or a meteor hitting Earth), worrying is useless, so let it go.</li>
<li><strong>A Long-Term Investor&rsquo;s Perspective</strong>: Don&rsquo;t fear market downturns; instead, fear that the market rises too quickly, preventing you from buying enough (like the market&rsquo;s rapid rebound after the tariff war). Downturns are buying opportunities. Resolutely do not sell core assets (like QQQ, 00662). It takes multiple experiences (e.g., 7 major slumps) to learn to buy the dip. You can choose not to buy, but you must never sell.</li>
<li><strong>Discipline for Leveraged Investing</strong>: A reminder that for leveraged investing, the initial cash allocation must exceed 30% (40% is also fine), with limits on the proportion of leveraged funds and a Beta not exceeding 1.0. This is emphasized because too many people ask the same questions and make allocation mistakes.</li>

Teacher James is dedicated to this, hoping to awaken more people to capitalism and that his followers will pass on the philosophy, change the world, and free themselves and those around them from financial worries.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Resources</strong>: Newcomers are advised to start with videos 00451 &ldquo;An Investment Lecture for Value Investors,&rdquo; 00398, 399, 400, 401, etc., and understand them in the context of the current market. The main recommendation is the Nasdaq 100 index fund (like QQQ), combined with cash or short-term treasury bonds. Relevant handouts and links will be provided on the Clubhouse message board and in the pinned comment on YouTube.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: I&rsquo;ve watched every episode this year and find that the Clubhouse platform has the most comprehensive information and links. YouTube Music is also a good experience, but finding consecutive episodes on YouTube can be a bit inconvenient. I hope there could be a central place for all handouts and links shared by the teacher.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: The YouTube channel has playlists, such as the &ldquo;Weekly ClubHouse&rdquo; series which already has 39 entries and can be played in order. There is also a playlist for short videos with 595 clips. Using playlists makes it easy to listen continuously.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 1: In the smart rebalancing model you mentioned, during an uptrend, 30% of the profits from QLD are moved to SGOV, and during a downtrend, 2% of SGOV is moved to QLD. Is this 2% related to the previously mentioned &ldquo;using 2% of your assets annually for living expenses&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: In smart rebalancing, during an up year, you move 30% of that year&rsquo;s appreciation from the leveraged fund (like QLD) into cash (like SGOV). In a down year, you move 2% of your total assets (equivalent to a portion of living expenses or a planned investment amount) from cash into the leveraged fund. For retirees, the core principle is to ensure your cash reserve can last at least 15 years, because after a market peak, it might take up to 15 years for a non-leveraged fund (QQQ) to have a high probability of doubling. For example, if you start with 50% cash and 50% QQQ, and the market falls for several years while you rebalance, you must ensure the remaining cash can still cover living expenses for (15 years - years passed). A strategy of 70% QQQ + 30% cash, without touching the cash for 15 years, is another option. The key is the &ldquo;15-year cash buffer.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: The total assets of the U.S. are about $200 trillion (200T), with the stock market being about $50T. What comprises the other $150T? Is there an index to track the flow of funds between the stock market and cash?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The remaining assets include real estate, mineral resources, various physical assets, etc. There is currently no specific public index tracking this kind of macro fund flow. The total assets of the U.S. are enormous and grow substantially each year (e.g., by $20-30T). Its debt (about $36T) is not a major issue relative to its total assets and annual growth, so the public shouldn&rsquo;t worry too much. In comparison, an individual investor&rsquo;s balance sheet risk might be higher. As for the claim that Social Security is going bankrupt, I&rsquo;ve been hearing that for 40 years. There&rsquo;s no need to worry; the U.S. can solve it. The Social Security fund itself is more like a pay-as-you-go system, where contributions from new workers pay for retirees&rsquo; benefits, rather than a massive investment fund.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: I am an investor from mainland China and also a Christian. Last year, I sold a primary residence and invested the funds. I feel like a steward of money with a responsibility to manage it well. I originally planned to dollar-cost average into USD and have opened an account in Hong Kong. After listening to your classes recently, I&rsquo;ve been deeply moved by your selfless dedication and strongly agree with your investment philosophy. My current plan is to use my wife&rsquo;s and my annual $50,000 foreign exchange quotas to transfer funds to Longbridge Securities and gradually buy assets like QQQ. I&rsquo;ve also bought some 513100 in the domestic A-share market. Our total capital is about 3 million RMB. I plan to deploy most of it in Longbridge Securities within six months, keeping a small portion domestically. Is this a reasonable approach? I considered using HSBC for pledging, but the threshold is high (over 1 million HKD), transferring from Longbridge to HSBC has fees, and HSBC&rsquo;s management fees might be high. I plan to wait until I have enough capital to transfer it to HSBC all at once.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Your approach is reasonable. You can first accumulate assets in Longbridge Securities and then transfer them in one go when your capital reaches HSBC&rsquo;s pledging threshold or when you are ready to pledge. This is more economical. Investors in mainland China generally lack financial literacy; many get hurt after entering the market blindly and then stay away, including Kevin&rsquo;s own wife who suffered losses in the stock market in 2015 due to the wrong philosophy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing 2: I deeply resonate with your sharing on both the &ldquo;technique&rdquo; (术) of investing and the &ldquo;way&rdquo; (道) of life. I also listen to Pastor Stephen Tong&rsquo;s sermons and have many reflections. Thank you for your efforts. You&rsquo;ve mentioned Confucius and Zhuangzi; I was wondering if you&rsquo;ve come across Pastor Tong&rsquo;s sharing on these topics?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Thank you for sharing, Kevin. I haven&rsquo;t specifically listened to Pastor Stephen Tong&rsquo;s sharing, but I maintain an open and learning attitude towards various religious and philosophical thoughts (Christianity, Buddhism, etc.). If it&rsquo;s recommended to me, I&rsquo;ll listen, as I believe all great truths are interconnected. The core of investing is this: we own companies (like the 100 companies represented by QQQ), and we shouldn&rsquo;t sell them easily just because of external opinions on their stock prices (Mr. Market&rsquo;s neurotic quotes). Focus on long-term holding and accumulating shares, just like accumulating real estate, but with better liquidity. Investing should be passive and simple. You only need to spend 5 minutes at the end of the year (e.g., Dec 31st or the market open on Jan 2nd or 3rd) to rebalance once. Avoid emotional trading based on short-term market fluctuations, which will only get you into trouble, like being influenced by Mr. Market and becoming a &ldquo;lunatic&rsquo;s lunatic.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Question 1: In your Excel model for maintenance margin calculation, are leveraged funds excluded? Is this also the case in Taiwan?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes, in the models of U.S. brokerages, leveraged funds usually cannot be used to calculate maintenance margin because they cannot be pledged themselves. If a Taiwanese brokerage allows leveraged funds to be pledged, its risk tolerance would be better, and the calculated maintenance margin might include the leveraged portion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: My investment journey has been: 0056 (high-dividend) -&gt; 0050 (Taiwan 50) -&gt; 00646 (S&amp;P 500 ETF) -&gt; 00662 (Nasdaq 100 ETF). I recently re-listened to one of your earlier sessions (possibly 00451 or another early one) where you mentioned that if one doesn&rsquo;t have enough money, they could buy 0056 and live off the 4% annual dividend for retirement. Did I misunderstand? It feels like I&rsquo;ve come full circle.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You didn&rsquo;t mishear. Different strategies apply to different life stages and asset sizes. If you are still relatively young, you can use a 433 (QQQ non-leveraged, QLD leveraged, cash) allocation for aggressive growth. If you are close to retirement and your assets are not enough to support a 2% annual withdrawal (i.e., total assets 50 times your annual expenses)—for example, you need 1 million per year but have less than 50 million, maybe only 30 million—then a less volatile option like 00646 (S&amp;P 500) with a 3% annual withdrawal might be a choice. If your assets are even smaller (e.g., only 20 or 25 million), then a high-dividend ETF like 0056, withdrawing the 4% dividend to supplement your living expenses, is a reluctant but realistic option. The 0056 plan is for special cases of insufficient assets; the mainstream, ideal allocation is still centered around QQQ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: If I am about to retire and the market happens to be in a major downturn, at a low point in the model, how should I reposition my assets and plan my living expense withdrawals?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You should base your 2% annual living expense calculation on the total asset value at the market&rsquo;s peak before your retirement. For example, if you had 50 million at the peak and planned to spend 1 million a year. Even if the market then drops for three years and your assets shrink to 25 million, you should still try to maintain your 1 million annual living standard (if your cash reserves allow). Because the market has already been down for several years, the risk is actually lower. You&rsquo;ve passed a three-year window, and you should trust that the market will recover in the coming cycle (15 years minus the years passed).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 4: I am a Taiwanese investor and I buy 00662 with TWD. If the TWD appreciates significantly in the future, will my assets shrink as a result?

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: In the long run (e.g., 20, 30, or even over 40 years), the impact of currency fluctuations tends to approach zero. For instance, the TWD/USD exchange rate has historically fluctuated between 25 and 33. Your buying and selling (or spending) is a continuous process, not a single point in time. So, don&rsquo;t worry too much about currency issues; it&rsquo;s not within our consideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 5: There&rsquo;s a U.S. law (the student mentioned &ldquo;Law 899,&rdquo; possibly referring to FATCA or another tax law for foreigners), will it affect us Taiwanese investors?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: That (usually referring to FATCA, etc.) has little to do with Taiwanese people, so don&rsquo;t worry. It mainly targets countries with unequal tax treaties or reciprocal relationships with the U.S., like some G7 countries in Europe (Germany, France, UK, etc.).</li>

<li>Sharing: Thanks for your previous advice on my work issue; my mindset at work has improved a lot. I recall reading the book &ldquo;I Might Be Wrong&rdquo; (the author is Swedish) and noted down two points: 1. Secular success doesn&rsquo;t necessarily bring happiness. 2. Focusing on your breath can train your brain. I didn&rsquo;t quite understand it back then.</li>
<li>Question 1: With your rich experience and having reached your current level, what do you think ultimate happiness is? Also, there are many methods for practicing breathing now (like in yoga); do you have any specific experience with learning to breathe?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ul>
<li><strong>Breathing</strong>: It&rsquo;s very simple, just &ldquo;observe your breath&rdquo; (观呼吸). Notice your own inhales and exhales, know that you are breathing. This is observing the breath. Doing so will naturally clear your mind, eliminate distracting thoughts, and enter a state of &ldquo;presence,&rdquo; a relaxed state focused on the now. We often forget we are breathing during the day, which means we are in a tense state.</li>
<li><strong>Happiness</strong>: Happiness is not determined by secular success or external evaluation. The value of a stock has nothing to do with me. The only thing to focus on is yourself. True happiness comes from within. Practice methods: 1. Observe your breath. 2. Practice introspection (similar to meditation or Christian prayer), empty your mind. 3. Relax your entire body (from head to toe), you can lie down, sit in a chair, or sit cross-legged. 4. Enter a hypnotic state (possible after long practice). 5. In the hypnotic state, give yourself positive affirmations (Re-programming), for example, tell yourself &ldquo;I am happy, I am happy, I am happy,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am wealthy, I am wealthy, I am wealthy,&rdquo; &ldquo;All the money in the world is mine, all the money in the world is mine, all the money in the world is mine,&rdquo; &ldquo;All the market&rsquo;s money is mine,&rdquo; &ldquo;My stocks will always go up, up, up, up, only up and never down.&rdquo; Curve your lips upwards, practice smiling. Happiness needs practice. This is the basic skill of hypnotherapy. I recommend the &ldquo;Rachel&rsquo;s Hypnosis Channel&rdquo; on YouTube, which has many guided sessions for different needs (like improving sleep, increasing wealth, relaxation).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: I previously had some money in Firstrade (about 4 million TWD, 5-6% of my total assets). Recently, I&rsquo;ve heard some concerns about overseas brokerages and plan to wire this money back to Taiwan. My current asset allocation is 433. After this money comes back, should I directly convert it to TWD and buy 00670L (Taiwan&rsquo;s Nasdaq leveraged ETF), or should I use this &ldquo;small amount of money&rdquo; to invest in QLD (since the amount is not large, it won&rsquo;t exceed the 7.5 million TWD tax exemption for overseas income by much)? I want to slightly adjust my overall allocation from 433 to 424.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: As long as your total cash reserve remains above 30%, the market value of your leveraged fund does not exceed your non-leveraged fund or your cash position, and the overall Beta of your portfolio does not exceed 1.0, you can proceed as you wish.</li>

<li>Sharing: I always wanted to be a &ldquo;big shot&rdquo; (senior manager), so I left a large company for a VP role at a small Singaporean firm. My salary doubled, but my workload also doubled. I was basically working 7 days a week, 18 hours a day, with no personal time, not even on Sundays or evenings. What was worse, in my third or fourth week, during a meeting with the company&rsquo;s CTO, he was extremely rude (saying things like &ldquo;a one-year-old child could have made your presentation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;what did I hire you for?&rdquo;). I was very upset and felt verbally abused. Then I remembered your words and realized it wasn&rsquo;t worth it. I contacted my former boss at the big company (who said, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say you were going on leave?&rdquo;), and he welcomed me back. I quickly resigned and returned to my old company. Although I&rsquo;m not a &ldquo;big shot,&rdquo; I feel it was the right decision. That one month at the small company was miserable; there was no happiness. It seems more money can&rsquo;t buy happiness.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Brian, you did the absolutely right thing! Cutting your losses in time and leaving an unsuitable environment is crucial. Just as we shouldn&rsquo;t buy or sell based on stock price fluctuations, we shouldn&rsquo;t choose or leave a job solely based on salary. Happiness is priceless, &ldquo;worth a thousand pieces of gold,&rdquo; and far more important than a high salary. When considering a job, the first question to ask is &ldquo;Am I happy?&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re not, you should leave. Happiness is a human right. You shouldn&rsquo;t accept anything that makes you unhappy. First, remove external sources of unhappiness, then cultivate inner happiness. Young people should try to work for large companies. They have more resources, better systems, and you can learn more (learn systems, management, learn in a big ocean), and the career paths are broader. If you encounter a bad manager or department in a large company, consider an internal transfer (the manager might be transferred, but a good company will remain), rather than resigning hastily. I myself proactively sought an opportunity to be transferred from Acer Taiwan to the US.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: I am an old student who started following you during the market low in 2002, and you gave me a lot of confidence back then. Recently, there&rsquo;s a trend in our group to share that if you use a large amount of cash from your pledged loan, you should prepare twice the borrowed amount in cash as a buffer. To meet this requirement, I sold some of my QLD to supplement my cash, which brought my Beta down very low. Now, I have a new sum of money coming in. Should I use it to pay back part of the loan, or to buy back the QLD I sold? Cheng Feng&rsquo;s advice was that if you use a large sum of money, you need to adjust the entire portfolio proportionally, including the non-leveraged fund (QQQ). Does this conflict with your frequent advice to &ldquo;never sell the core fund&rdquo;? Also, I think Kate said that new funds coming in shouldn&rsquo;t be used to return to a fixed ratio allocation? I&rsquo;m very confused and feel like I haven&rsquo;t grasped the core idea after following you for so long.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Cheng Feng&rsquo;s understanding is correct. When you &ldquo;borrow and spend&rdquo; a large amount of cash from your pledged account (e.g., 10% or more of your total assets, like borrowing 1 million from a 10 million total asset base), this is a special situation that requires a &ldquo;re-navigation&rdquo; or &ldquo;re-positioning&rdquo; of your entire asset allocation.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example and Adjustment Steps</strong>: Let&rsquo;s say you originally had 10 million in assets with a 433 allocation: 4 million in QQQ, 3 million in QLD, and 3 million in cash. Now, you need to borrow and spend 1 million for an emergency.
<ol>
<li>For this 1 million loan, you need to set aside an additional 2 million in cash as a risk buffer (because you borrowed 1 million, you prepare 2 million in cash).</li>
<li>So, out of your 10 million total assets, 2 million in cash is specifically designated to cover this loan risk. The remaining 8 million (10 million - 2 million) is then allocated according to your target allocation (e.g., 433, or adjusted to a more conservative Beta of 0.8, which corresponds to a certain proportion). Specifically, a 433 allocation for 8 million would be: 3.2M QQQ, 2.4M QLD, 2.4M operational cash. Add the 2M risk buffer, and your total cash is 4.4M. In this case, the leveraged fund is 2.4M, which is 24% of the 10M total assets, contributing a Beta of 0.48; the non-leveraged fund is 3.2M, contributing a Beta of 0.32. The total Beta is 0.8.</li>
<li>In this situation, selling a portion of your existing QQQ and QLD proportionally and combining it with your existing cash to create the 2 million risk buffer and the cash needed for the new allocation is a reasonable &ldquo;asset structure adjustment.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not considered a &ldquo;sale that violates the never-sell principle.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>New Capital Injection</strong>: When you have new funds coming in (like the new capital you mentioned), you can use them to restore your QLD position or to supplement the relevant parts of your &ldquo;re-navigated&rdquo; target allocation (which might be Beta 0.8). Restoring QLD to bring the Beta back to 0.8 is fine; it doesn&rsquo;t have to go back to 1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Kate&rsquo;s Viewpoint</strong>: What Kate said about &ldquo;new funds not being used to return to a fixed ratio&rdquo; usually refers to routine, small-scale additions of capital. In that case, you don&rsquo;t need to strictly follow the initial 433 ratio; you can flexibly add to the part you feel needs strengthening the most (e.g., add to cash if it&rsquo;s low, or add to the leveraged position if you want to increase it). This is a different scenario from the &ldquo;re-allocation&rdquo; after a &ldquo;large withdrawal and spending&rdquo; that you described. When a plane is on autopilot, small adjustments are fine. But if the number of passengers changes significantly or the destination changes, you need to re-plan the route and fuel.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Under normal autopilot (small fund inflows/outflows or rebalancing due to market fluctuations), the core asset is not easily touched. But when a major event like a large withdrawal for spending occurs, changing the overall risk structure, you need to re-evaluate and adjust the entire allocation. Following for a long time doesn&rsquo;t guarantee you&rsquo;ve learned well; the key is to learn the core principles.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: I want to share some risk points about the direct selling (or MLM) industry, as I heard a user mention wanting to return to Taiwan to do direct selling to change their situation.
<ol>
<li><strong>High entry fees</strong>: Be wary of these.</li>
<li><strong>No substantial product or service</strong>: Or the price of the product/service is severely disconnected from its market value (e.g., selling wine from Maotai Town at an exorbitant price; something worth a few hundred sold for thousands).</li>
<li><strong>Focus on recruiting downlines, ignoring consumer experience</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Different purchase prices for agents at different levels</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Promises of quick riches through IPOs, dividends, or stock options</strong>: Especially with newly established companies that lure you into buying a lot of inventory at once.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Advice for Choosing Direct Selling</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Mainland China</strong>: Look for companies with a direct selling license issued by the Ministry of Commerce (a total of 88), which are relatively legitimate. There are now many new retail, social e-commerce, and micro-business models whose underlying logic may be similar.</li>
<li><strong>US or other regions</strong>: Choose companies that have been established for over 10 years, preferably publicly listed ones (financial reports are public and transparent, and can be analyzed). Only about 10% of new companies survive for three to five years; most fail within five years.</li>
<li><strong>Long-termism</strong>: Even with legitimate direct selling, it requires long-term commitment (at least 5 years). Don&rsquo;t expect to get rich quick. If it feels like a &ldquo;great opportunity&rdquo; for rapid change, there&rsquo;s a high risk of being scammed.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of &ldquo;Direct Selling + Insurance&rdquo; models</strong>: In the US, services can also be sold via direct selling. The combination of direct selling and insurance requires special caution, as it can be highly deceptive, seeming to offer both income and security. Chinese direct selling law requires physical products and a factory.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: JASON&rsquo;s reminder is excellent; scams are everywhere. Everyone should be wary of messages that demand urgent action (e.g., &ldquo;Your payment of $698 has been successful, please call this number if you have questions&rdquo;), or else your account will be frozen, your package will be lost, or that urge you to pay first. You can use AI tools like ChatGPT to make a preliminary judgment on the authenticity of an email (I once used ChatGPT to verify a DMV email). Remember, nothing is that urgent. Take a deep breath, think calmly, and don&rsquo;t part with your money easily. When people are eager to do something (like get rich), they are more likely to be scammed. I myself had an experience in high school with a summer job scam that cost me 300 TWD; I paid the fee and the person disappeared.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The market is truly unrelated to international situations, financial reports, or the economy. Whether interest rates are cut or not doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s all fine, it has nothing to do with us. It all has nothing to do with me.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This viewpoint, woven throughout the session, emphasizes the transcendent mindset an investor should have, focusing on their own investment discipline and not being distracted by external noise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The market will definitely go up, the market will definitely reach new highs. Investing requires patience, and wealth is worth the trouble.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This articulates a firm belief in the long-term trend of the market and the character required for successful investing—patience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I might be wrong. I might be wrong. I might be wrong.
&ndash; Teacher James (quoting from the book &ldquo;I Might Be Wrong&rdquo;)</p></blockquote>
<p>When facing disagreements or strong emotions, engaging in self-reflection first can help resolve conflicts and enhance cognition and inner peace.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hold stocks in your hand, but not their prices in your heart. You only need to spend five minutes a year on it.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This describes the ideal state of investing: holding quality assets without being disturbed by short-term price fluctuations, emphasizing the simplicity and passive nature of investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boredom is the highest state of investing. If you feel it&rsquo;s exciting, then you&rsquo;re speculating, you&rsquo;re gambling.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This reveals the true nature of long-term value investing, drawing a clear line between it and the thrill-seeking behavior of speculation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can handle something, face it and get it done. If you can&rsquo;t handle it, then forget about it, as it&rsquo;s not within your capability.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This offers a philosophical attitude for dealing with various problems in life and investing, reducing unnecessary worries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely do not sell your QQQ, sell your 00662, during a downturn. You can choose not to buy, but you must never sell.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This emphasizes that one should not panic-sell core quality assets during a market correction, a common mistake among investors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t leave (your current job) because your salary is low, and don&rsquo;t jump to another just because its salary is high.
&ndash; Teacher James (commenting on Brian&rsquo;s sharing)</p></blockquote>
<p>This highlights that in career choices, personal happiness and the growth environment are more important than short-term salary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your cash must be able to last you 15 years (during a market downturn). This is a critical key.
&ndash; Teacher James (on asset allocation for retirees)</p></blockquote>
<p>This points out the importance of having cash reserves in retirement planning that can cover a long bear market (which could last up to 15 years before the market doubles).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happiness is a human right. Therefore, you shouldn&rsquo;t accept anything that makes you unhappy.
&ndash; Teacher James (commenting on Brian&rsquo;s sharing)</p></blockquote>
<p>This encourages people to prioritize inner happiness and harmony in their work and life, and to have the courage to change unhappy situations.</p>

In terms of asset allocation, the teacher detailed cash management strategies for different life stages, especially the importance of having 15 years of living expenses for retirees to safely navigate market cycles, and gave clear guidance on pledging, leverage, and Beta control. The Q&amp;A session delved into specific cases, addressing students&rsquo; confusion in practical operations, such as portfolio adjustments after large cash withdrawals, tax considerations for overseas investments, the wisdom of career choices, and preventing financial scams like direct selling. The teacher encouraged students to work and live in a relaxed, stress-free state, to simplify investing, and ultimately achieve financial freedom and life happiness. He emphasized investing in index funds like QQQ/00662 and avoiding annuities and unnecessary insurance.</p>

<li><strong>Rational Approach</strong>: Both life and investing require a rational attitude. If your investments make you anxious, it may indicate a flaw in your strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Long-Term Investing</strong>: To achieve peace of mind, choose long-term index investing. This allows you to avoid constantly watching the market and prevents your life and family from being disrupted by market volatility.</li>

<li><strong>Solid Returns with Beta 0.5</strong>: Even with just 50% in QQQ (Beta 0.5) and 50% in cash (e.g., a money market fund with a hypothetical 4% return), the long-term annualized return can be substantial (e.g., 0.5 * 4% + 0.5 * 14% = 9%).</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation for Retirees</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Retirees with sufficient funds should prioritize stability over maximum returns.</li>
<li>Suggested allocations: 70% QQQ + 30% cash; 60% QQQ + 40% cash; or 50% QQQ + 50% cash.</li>
<li>Keep at least 30% in cash as a stabilizing force.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rebalancing Considerations</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If you have sufficient cash flow and reserves, there&rsquo;s no need to actively rebalance. Let QQQ grow through compounding.</li>
<li>If reserves are insufficient, sell a portion of QQQ when it has significant gains to increase your cash reserves.</li>
<li>Retirees can set aside 15 years of living expenses in cash and invest the rest in QQQ. When the cash is used up, withdraw half of the QQQ holdings into cash, and repeat the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation for Young People</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Set aside a 1-2 year emergency fund and prepare for children&rsquo;s tuition.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Correct Mistakes Promptly</strong>: If an initial investment strategy was wrong and led to losses, change it immediately rather than waiting to break even. The latter is a gambler&rsquo;s mentality.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Direction</strong>: Effort is meaningful only when the direction is correct. The right direction is proper asset allocation, index investing, and maintaining sufficient cash.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Awareness and Control</strong>: First, understand the risks (e.g., the market could drop 85% and stay there for 10 years). Then, control the risk through asset allocation (cash is a critical line of defense, like the air force and supplies in a battle).</li>
<li><strong>Buying Strategy</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The best option is to buy immediately when you have the money.</li>
<li>If buying in installments, do so at predetermined times and at the market price, regardless of market ups and downs.</li>
<li>&ldquo;He who buys is an apprentice; he who holds on for dear life is the master.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Wisdom of Borrowing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Money is only yours when it&rsquo;s in your pocket.&rdquo;</li>
<li>In low-interest-rate regions (like Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China), borrow money to invest. Use leverage to let &ldquo;other people&rsquo;s chickens lay eggs for you&rdquo; (generate returns with borrowed money) while your own &ldquo;chickens&rdquo; (assets) continue to grow.</li>
<li>Social security benefits and the like should be claimed as early as possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Individualized Advice</strong>: Teacher James emphasizes that his investment advice is a &ldquo;unique&rdquo; prescription for each person, tailored to their individual circumstances. There is no one-size-fits-all &ldquo;standard answer.&rdquo; For example, buying immediately at market price is ideal but not suitable for those with low psychological tolerance. A Beta of 1.0 or a 442 strategy (40% cash, 40% index, 20% leveraged index) offers high returns but also high risk. A Beta above 0.5 is enough to become wealthy.</li>

<ol>
<li>Successfully applied for a &ldquo;home equity line of credit&rdquo; in Taiwan with a limit of over NT$10 million, an interest rate of about 2.4%, and an interest-only period of 2 years, extendable once to 4 years. After 4 years, it can be converted to an &ldquo;overdraft account,&rdquo; where you only pay interest (rate around 2.5%) and can use the principal indefinitely.</li>
<li>Plans to start investing next week according to the teacher&rsquo;s 4-3-3 allocation (40% cash, 30% QQQ, 30% leveraged QQQ. Michel&rsquo;s understanding might differ slightly from the teacher&rsquo;s later clarification, which defined 433 as 40% cash, 30% index, 30% leveraged index).</li>
<li>Although he missed the lower entry points, he has come to realize that looking back 20 years from now, today&rsquo;s prices will all seem sweet.</li>
<li>Thanks the teacher for expanding his cognition and giving him the courage to use financial weapons. The bank&rsquo;s review process was strict, so getting the loan means the bank also considers the risk manageable. His wife being an employee of a listed company might have helped. He used to think he should never be in debt, but his perspective has now changed.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: The fact that the bank dared to lend to you means they have assessed the risk. The low interest rates in Taiwan are a great opportunity. The current price of QQQ (e.g., $70-80) makes little difference in the long run (e.g., when it reaches $80,000 in the future). He encourages buying as soon as possible. Investing with borrowed money is a capitalist awakening, not a rebellious act.</li>

<li>Question: The teacher recently discussed technical analysis on other platforms to guide people towards long-term investing. Could he briefly explain the differences, pros, and cons of short-term technical analysis versus long-term investing for new students?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: He respects short-term traders and their philosophies. He used to trade that way himself with good results (but emphasizes it&rsquo;s not for everyone). He compares short-term trading to being a race car driver, with its specific scenarios and risks. Sharing his technical analysis experience is a way to offer them some help or an alternative perspective (long-term investing), not to change them. He is practicing how to communicate with people of different viewpoints, as if talking to his 25-year-old self. He himself does not trade short-term now and does not recommend it to his students. The technical analysis he refers to is very short-term (determining long/short based on a single candlestick). He admires the focus and effort of short-term traders.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: Explained investing to a 14-year-old from a poor family. He used analogies (Is today better than five years ago? Is this generation better off than our parents&rsquo;? Will the future be even better? Farmland evolving from growing bananas to oil palms to durians to solar panels, constantly seeking higher returns) to illustrate that QQQ automatically weeds out the weak and keeps the strong, just like how the &ldquo;fertile field&rdquo; of American high-tech is constantly being optimized. The boy&rsquo;s eyes filled with hope when he saw how 50 Malaysian Ringgit could become tens of millions through decades of compounding. IAM feels that 80-90% of people around him don&rsquo;t understand QQQ and will persist in sharing one-on-one.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: (Mentioned later when answering IAM&rsquo;s question) Being able to plant the seed of wealth for a young person is to save a person, a family. It is a wonderful thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 1: Regarding asset allocation (e.g., 442, 433, 631), after doing his own homework, he found that risk tolerance is closely related to one&rsquo;s personal life situation (work, consumption). He asks the teacher to confirm if asset allocation should be strictly by percentage, or if the proportion of leveraged funds should not exceed the cash or original capital.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Strategies like 433 (40% cash, 30% index fund, 30% leveraged fund) or 442 (40% cash, 40% index, 20% leveraged index) aim to raise the Beta to 1.0 using leverage while maintaining the safety of cash, thereby hoping not to lose out on market returns. This is the highest-risk allocation that passed simulations, like a plane pulling up just after scraping the ground—highly efficient. But it&rsquo;s not the only option; for example, 50% QQQ + 50% cash used as collateral also works. For retirees, it&rsquo;s recommended to keep Beta below 0.8, have at least 30% cash, and the leveraged fund portion should not exceed the cash or original capital—the lower the better, or even none at all. Beta should not be lower than 0.5.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: How exactly does QQQ&rsquo;s mechanism of &ldquo;weeding out the weak&rdquo; work? Is it based on market capitalization comparison or a standard like outperforming the SPY?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: QQQ selects the top 100 non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq, ranked by market capitalization. Market Cap = Stock Price × Shares Outstanding. If a company performs poorly, its stock price falls, and its market cap drops out of the top 100, it gets removed. This has nothing to do with whether the company is profitable (e.g., Amazon and Tesla were included in their early, unprofitable days due to their large market caps). The S&amp;P 500, on the other hand, has other criteria like profitability. QQQ selects the top 100, while SPY selects the top 500; a more elite group (QQQ) will generally have better average performance. The Dow Jones 30 is an even older index construction method.</li>

<li>Question: He is confused about stablecoins (fiat-backed, commodity-backed, crypto-backed). The original purpose of cryptocurrency was decentralization, but stablecoins seem centralized, even managed by governments. What is their purpose? Why not just invest in fiat currencies, commodities, or the US dollar directly? Can stablecoins appreciate in value? What is their real use? Is there an arbitrage opportunity like the one between TSMC&rsquo;s ADR (TSM) and its Taiwan stock (2330)?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ul>
<li><strong>TSMC Price Difference</strong>: It&rsquo;s normal for the same asset to have different prices in different markets (US ADR vs. local Taiwan stock), just as the same product has different prices in different stores, determined by market supply and demand.</li>
<li><strong>Core Value of Stablecoins</strong>: It mainly lies in <strong>transaction efficiency</strong>. Digital currency transfers are nearly instantaneous and global, whereas cross-border fiat transfers take days.</li>
<li><strong>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC)</strong>: Europe, China, and others are developing CBDCs to improve the circulation efficiency of their own currencies. China is also promoting CIPS to bypass SWIFT.</li>
<li><strong>US Shift in Attitude Towards Stablecoins</strong>: The US initially suppressed digital currencies (e.g., dealing with Binance&rsquo;s CZ, certain crypto-related banks). However, after the Trump administration, it realized that the dollar&rsquo;s status could be challenged by highly efficient digital currencies. It then shifted to embracing and regulating existing private stablecoin issuers (like Circle), bringing them under supervision through measures like the &ldquo;Genius Act&rdquo; (likely a colloquial term for a stablecoin regulation bill) to maintain the dollar&rsquo;s dominance in the digital sphere.</li>
<li><strong>Stablecoins Do Not Appreciate</strong>: Stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) are pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Their reserves consist of equivalent amounts of short-term US Treasury bills and cash. Issuers profit by earning interest on these reserves, while the stablecoins themselves do not pay interest to holders.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Stablecoins</strong>: They are primarily used for rapid payments and settlements, especially in international trade or business-to-business transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Monetary Expansion Effect</strong>: When banks hold Treasuries and issue an equivalent amount of stablecoins, it effectively increases the money supply (the Treasuries still exist, and now stablecoins are also in circulation). This is a positive for the stock market because it increases the liquidity of money and boosts economic efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Us as Investors</strong>: The accelerated flow of money will stimulate the economy, which is good for the stock market. Banks gain a new source of interest income from issuing stablecoins, so bank stocks may benefit.</li>
<li><strong>Regulation and KYC</strong>: To prevent money laundering, etc., the issuance and trading of stablecoins will be strictly regulated, requiring KYC (Know Your Customer) identity verification.</li>

He emphasizes that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with these tools themselves, but if the user is not proficient or has ill intentions (like fortune-tellers who often exaggerate problems to sell solutions), they can be misleading or even harmful.

<p>In this session, Teacher James once again emphasized the core strategy of long-term investment in high-quality index funds (like QQQ) and encouraged investors to remain optimistic in the current market environment. He focused on the personalized needs of asset allocation, particularly providing several robust allocation plans for retirees, aimed at balancing returns and risks to ultimately achieve financial freedom and inner peace. Furthermore, from the height of life philosophy, the teacher elaborated on the importance of an investor&rsquo;s mindset, reminding investors to overcome the weaknesses of human nature. In the Q&amp;A session, he provided detailed answers to hot-topic questions from students regarding Taiwan&rsquo;s credit lines, how to explain investing to young people, the use of leverage, the mechanism of stablecoins, and their profound impact on the future financial landscape (especially the status of the US dollar and the stock market). Overall, this session offered a comprehensive guide for investors, encompassing macroeconomic outlooks, micro-level operational advice, and deep philosophical insights.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Volatility is Normal</strong>: The market is always fluctuating; this is the unchanging rule. No need to analyze specific reasons (international situation, trade war, financial report forecasts, etc.). Many analysts themselves do not truly understand. The market is like the sea, unaffected by streams and storms.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Investing</strong>: True investment is buying with the intention of never selling. Intending to sell at a high point is speculation. Investment must be long-term.</li>
<li><strong>Index Investing</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Recommendation</strong>: Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQQ and its global equivalents). Reason: Compared to the S&amp;P 500 (500 companies, possibly 450 &ldquo;bad companies&rdquo;), the Nasdaq 100 focuses more on high-quality technology companies, aligning with the &ldquo;the bigger, the stronger&rdquo; trend.</li>
<li><strong>Retirees/Those with Less Capital</strong>: Consider Taiwan 0056 or US SPHD (dividend yield ~3.5%, providing stable cash flow).</li>
<li><strong>Nasdaq 100 ETF List</strong>: Provides a list of relevant ETFs including various countries (Canada HXQ.t, Singapore, Malaysia, Norway, UK, Australia, etc.). HXQ.t is recommended because it does not pay dividends (tax-free).</li>
<li><strong>Historical Experience</strong>: Watching videos since 2018 can provide insights into investor sentiment and responses during market fluctuations, giving a sense of the long-term perspective.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stay Optimistic</strong>: Investors need to be extremely optimistic, always facing the sunlight, believing that the market will be good in the long run, even if there is a world war, the market still exists and continues to rise (only rises, never falls).</li>
<li><strong>Investment Target Selection</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>00864B vs 00865B (Taiwan Bond ETF)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>00864B: Pays dividends, generating National Health Insurance Supplementary Premium (2.11%), requires manual reinvestment (with handling fees, easy to forget resulting in no compounding), dividends are considered overseas income (requires declaration if it exceeds the limit, but usually not a problem with annual income below NT$1 million; according to student feedback, it is exempt from the second-generation health insurance supplementary premium).</li>
<li>00865B: Does not pay dividends, avoiding the above problems, simpler and more effective in the long run. Low trading volume is not a problem (market makers provide liquidity), initial performance differences will shrink as scale increases. <strong>Strongly recommend switching to 00865B; convenience is a value.</strong> Conversion will incur a one-time transaction cost, but worth it in the long run.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/B)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Not recommended for investment</strong>. Reason: Actively managed fund, more volatile than the index; times are changing, performance has lagged behind the S&amp;P 500; uncertainty after Buffett (&ldquo;the devil will come out&rdquo;); learning Buffett should be about learning his long-term investment spirit, investment discourse (such as the definition of investment), rather than stock picking. Investing in the S&amp;P 500 may be better than investing in BRK.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation (Beta)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic Principle</strong>: It is recommended that most people allocate an investment portfolio with a Beta value of less than 1, such as 70% index funds + 30% cash/money market funds (Beta is approximately 0.7).</li>
<li><strong>Risk Tolerance</strong>: The recent 20% drop has made many people uncomfortable (even those with a Beta of 1.2 configured at 4:4:2), indicating that actual risk tolerance may be lower than expected. Do not sacrifice the comfort of holding enough cash (&ldquo;don&rsquo;t gamble with the money you need for the money you don&rsquo;t need&rdquo;) for an extra 1-2% of return.</li>
<li><strong>Adjustment</strong>: If the initial Beta is high (such as 1.2), it is recommended to review it at the end of each year. If the market rises, you can sell part of the leveraged/index position and supplement the cash to more than 30%, gradually reducing the Beta to below 1.0. Consider smart rebalancing after the Beta is below 1.0.</li>

<li><strong>AI Optimized Future</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Productivity greatly improved, most output is completed by AI (robots), and the cost of goods approaches zero.</li>
<li>Total social wealth accelerates, basic living needs (food, clothing, housing, transportation) may be free, uniformly supplied by the state/society (AI robots complete production, construction, and maintenance).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Social Structure Changes</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Classes Still Exist</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Capitalists</strong>: Earn profits by investing in and holding the means of production (AI systems) without labor; the wealthiest. Everyone can become a capitalist (just need to know how to invest).</li>
<li><strong>High-Tech Workers</strong>: Personnel who maintain and manage AI systems, with excellent income, can enjoy entertainment beyond basic needs (such as space travel), but may fall into the &ldquo;cared-for&rdquo; class if they stop working and do not become capitalists.</li>
<li><strong>Cared-For Class (approximately 80%)</strong>: No need to work, basic life is guaranteed (food, clothing, housing, transportation, medical care), but cannot enjoy additional entertainment or resources. The standard of living may be similar to the current upper-middle class, but without work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Philosophical Challenges</strong>:
<ul>
<li>When most people do not need to contribute for livelihood (&ldquo;nothing to serve&rdquo;), what is the meaning and purpose of life? (Analogous to being idle after retirement). May lead to widespread depression or social problems.</li>
<li>Human development may enter a stage of eternal life, facing greater philosophical and existential questions.</li>
<li>The focus should shift from &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; to &ldquo;the meaning of life.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Implications for Investors</strong>:
<ul>
<li>As capitalists, there is no need to worry about job loss due to AI development; on the contrary, they will become wealthier.</li>
<li>Start investing now to become part of the capitalist class.</li>

<li>Question: SPY and QQQ have risen for three days, will they continue to rise or fall next week?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Short-term market cannot be predicted, like flipping a coin. We invest for the long term (20+ years), focusing on long-term trends. Buy when you have money, never sell. Don&rsquo;t try to predict next week&rsquo;s market; ask the temple or the &ldquo;stock god&rdquo; in Clubhouse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing: Just started learning from the teacher&rsquo;s course two months ago, introduced by a friend in the United States. Currently in the learning stage, and has invested in some QQQ (cost between 515-530). After returning to Taiwan, considering investing in 00662. In the process of canceling previous insurance and converting individual stocks to 00662.</li>
<li>Question: Should I invest in US stocks (Firstrade account, worried about political risks in Taiwan for the child) or Taiwan stocks 00662? How to allocate at the beginning?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Recommend investing in 00662 in Taiwan, no need to use a US broker (Firstrade). It&rsquo;s better for the child to rely on themselves rather than worry about politics. When starting to learn, it is recommended to divide the total funds into three parts: 1/3 buy 00662 immediately, 1/3 buy in batches over the next 3-6 months, and 1/3 hold in cash. The ultimate goal is 70% 00662 + 30% cash. Then slowly learn whether and how to allocate leveraged funds (adjust the Beta value to 0.8-0.9).</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>Question 1: Who are QQQ and SPHD suitable for in terms of capital size?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: (Points out that students should watch the videos for repeated questions) This is a consideration for retirees. Need to calculate annual expenses after retirement. If 50 times the expenses equals your total assets, you can invest in QQQ (equivalent to a 2% annual withdrawal rate). If 2% is not enough, you need 3%, you may consider the S&amp;P 500. Only consider SPHD if you need even higher (~3.5-4%). Non-retirees should prioritize the high-growth QQQ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Explain Beta value. Beta=1 is synchronized with the market? Beta=1.2 is 1.2 times the volatility? Is the Beta of an 80% QQQ + 20% SGOV portfolio 0.8?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Basic understanding is correct. Beta measures the volatility of an asset relative to the market. The Beta of an 80/20 portfolio is approximately 0.8. (Reminds again that the videos explain it)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: Will the principal of SGOV (Short-Term US Treasury ETF) fall and lose money?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: The principal risk is extremely low, almost no losses (except for minor fluctuations before and after dividend payments). SGOV invests in short-term Treasury bills (T-Bills) issued by the US Treasury Department with a maturity of 0-3 months (or within one year), backed by the credit of the United States.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Joined for more than a month and reviewed the market decline in 2022 and the teacher&rsquo;s videos (especially #398 graduation episode, learned investment psychology).</li>
<li>Question 1: In January 2023 (#401), the teacher used technical indicators (50/100-day moving average crossover) to judge the market bottom and predict that 2023 would be a bull market, which was also verified afterwards. However, in later videos (#491), he emphasized not to predict market cycles and not to look at macroeconomic indicators (prosperity signals, macroeconomics, inventory cycles, etc.). Why this change? Are these indicators really useless in the long run? What was the basis for judging the bottom (just because of being optimistic about the stock market)? Should we just follow discipline and rebalance once a year?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: QQQ includes many industries (semiconductors, software, AI, biotechnology, retail such as Costco, Pepsico, Amazon, Google, Apple, etc.), and indicators for a single industry or country (such as Taiwan semiconductor economy, Taiwan prosperity signals, US prosperity signals) cannot reflect the overall index. Looking at all indicators is the same as looking at the index itself, so it is better to just focus on QQQ. The judgment in early 2023 was based on 40 years of experience (calculated that the 6-month moving average would cross upward), which is difficult to convey (&ldquo;unspeakable&rdquo;), and teaching technical analysis may cause students to misuse it and be harmed (&ldquo;go crazy&rdquo;), so it is not taught. Adhering to long-term investment discipline and holding enough cash buffer (such as 30%) is a more reliable method. Even if judging the bottom at that time, all cash would not be invested (such as still maintaining Beta 0.7), still maintaining a margin of safety. No need to take too much risk for small potential gains (referring to Buffett&rsquo;s philosophy).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: About the currency hedging of 00670L (Taiwan Leveraged QQQ ETF). Is the impact of exchange rate fluctuations significant in the long run? If the US dollar falls sharply (such as 1:13 against the Taiwan dollar), how will 00670L perform? (The teacher mentioned before that 00670L performs poorly when the US dollar rises)
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: 00670L is usually paired with 00865B (cash/short-term bonds). Exchange rate fluctuations have a hedging effect on both (when the US dollar rises, the hedging cost of 00670L increases, but the value of US dollar assets increases; the opposite is true when the US dollar falls). In the long run, exchange rate fluctuations are normal (such as the Taiwan dollar fluctuating between 28-32), but there is no fixed trend, and the expected value is zero. Currency hedging itself has a cost (wasting funds), which may not be necessary in the long run (it is recommended that fund companies consider canceling it), but the ETF is designed that way, and it does not hurt. The key is whether 00670L can achieve approximately twice the return of 00662 in the long run.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Trump mentioned that 5.6 trillion in foreign investment may be invested in the United States in the future (may be exaggerated, even if halved, 2.8 trillion is also considerable), but the direction is beneficial to AI and QQQ. Observed that QQQ rebounded more strongly than SPY, DIA, and BRK recently, confirming the teacher&rsquo;s point of view (such as Katy Wood investing in AI-related companies when she saw mobile internet access). Compare the leadership styles of Chinese and American leaders (leader vs. manager) and the direction of attracting foreign investment (Saudi Arabia/Dubai vs. Myanmar/Vietnam/Malaysia).</li>
<li>Question: Please explain the difference between CIPS (Chinese RMB Cross-Border Payment System) and SWIFT. Why is CIPS faster (completed in 6 seconds)? Why does SWIFT take days? Can SWIFT be improved? Will this affect the status of the US dollar (AI replied that the two will coexist)?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: SWIFT is based on the traditional telegram transmission model (like a relay station), and information needs to be transferred through multiple layers (local bank -&gt; regional major bank -&gt; central bank -&gt; SWIFT center (Switzerland) -&gt; the other party&rsquo;s central bank -&gt; the other party&rsquo;s head office -&gt; the other party&rsquo;s branch), involving compliance checks (anti-money laundering), time difference, manual processing, etc., so it takes a long time (2+ days). CIPS is a modern real-time gross settlement system, similar to domestic payment systems in various countries, point-to-point or directly cleared through the central bank, and the speed is fast. CIPS uses RMB and is an alternative developed to deal with SWIFT being weaponized (such as sanctions against Russia), making people distrust the US dollar system. US sanctions opened a Pandora&rsquo;s box. Currently, CIPS is small (such as shipbuilding transactions between Malaysia and China), but it represents the trend of &ldquo;currency wars&rdquo; (such as Saudi Arabia and China being linked). Trump&rsquo;s visit to Saudi Arabia may be related to maintaining the status of the US dollar. Just watch the show.</li>

<li>Question: Regarding the customized version of ChatGPT (CCTeams Investment Advisor) shared by the teacher, its knowledge cutoff date seems to be June of last year. Is the teacher using an updated version? Will the link change after the update? (Previously confused HXQ/HSQ).
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Indeed, this AI is constantly being updated and trained. The link may change with updates. The latest link (showing content updated on April 26, such as 70/30 allocation recommendations) has been shared in the chat area. New links will be provided regularly (such as weekly or monthly) in the future. The teacher himself uses a more advanced personal &ldquo;Super AI&rdquo; account (possibly GPT-4o or higher, with memory function) to process and extract information, and then &ldquo;feeds&rdquo; the essence to this publicly shared GPTs version (similar to DIPS extraction). Feedback on AI answers is welcome for improvement.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Because of recent trade tensions, I re-listened to the 2022 recordings. Two points are profound: 1. The biggest risk is missing the market (leaving the market). 2. Focus on long-term returns, not short-term fluctuations/shocks. The market is full of contradictory information (repeated presidential statements, pessimistic commentators) and bad news, but it often rebounds unintentionally. Friends who wait for a clear trend (such as buying after the big trend comes back) miss the rise. No one can accurately time the market. It is extremely difficult to obtain stable and high returns in the long term (such as an annualized return of 10% or more), like the sustained performance of top athletes (such as playing ball for 20 years); it is easy to have a good shot occasionally, but difficult to be stable in the long term. It is essential to stay in the market for a long time and focus on long-term growth.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Strongly agree. Investing is like a long-distance race, continuing to stay in the front (such as 3rd or 4th place) will eventually win, because the leaders often make mistakes. This is how index funds are, not the best in a single year, but leading in the long term. Need an investment horizon of 15+ years. The key to persistence is having sufficient cash reserves (especially for retirees, it is recommended to have living expenses for 15+ years) or a continuous work income.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: Started following the teacher last year, investing on my own and encouraging elders (sold insurance and invested). Recently, I have experienced a market decline and am at peace, but the elders are experiencing large fluctuations for the first time (they adopted a Beta 1.2 allocation). Through repeatedly watching videos and communicating, the elders&rsquo; confidence is still stable.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Selling a house has been tortuous: difficulty communicating with my husband (disagreed at first, had disputes), cold market (the central bank fought housing speculation in September, difficult to get loans), price reduction (applied the teacher&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;there is no house that cannot be sold, only a price that cannot be sold&rdquo;) to complete the sale (in February this year). The process was painful (communication, management, market changes, funds stuck, high taxes), and I learned a lesson that I don&rsquo;t want to experience again.</li>
<li>Sharing 3: Currently, half of the investment portfolio is QQQ-like, half is TSMC, and there is also a mortgage line of credit (financial mortgage). My husband wants to use this line of credit to increase positions when the market falls (TSMC?), but hesitates and is afraid in the middle of the actual fall (soft-handed, unable to do it). This decline allowed him to experience his true risk tolerance. My husband did not accept the full QQQ allocation before, but now he has some experience. It verifies the stability of the teacher&rsquo;s asset allocation method.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Appreciate Monmon&rsquo;s peaceful state of mind (a good quality for investors, &ldquo;destiny&rdquo; + &ldquo;luck&rdquo; to meet the teacher). Communicating with family requires patience (it is a 15-30 year undertaking, no rush). The funds from the financial mortgage should be invested as soon as possible (such as 00662), buy blindly, and don&rsquo;t time the market. When investing, consider the overall asset allocation, include the loan amount in the total asset calculation, and ensure that the total Beta value is within the desired range (such as about 0.7, that is, maintaining an overall ratio of about 70/30), rather than investing all the borrowed money in high-risk assets. It is recommended to keep at least 30% cash (can be 4:1:5 or 5:1:4, Beta 0.6 or 0.7). This decline is a touchstone for risk tolerance, proving the necessity of conservative allocation. Even if young and have a job, 30% cash is also recommended.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: The situation is similar to Monmon&rsquo;s. Both myself and the elders invested in 00662/00670L, using Beta 1.2 (4:4:2, that is, 40% 00662, 40% 00670L, 20% cash/00865B) allocation. I can bear the recent fluctuations (the government is quite amazing), but I am not sure whether the elders (who have not watched YouTube, have no financial common sense, but believe and invest) can bear greater future declines (such as 40-80%). Continuously accompany the elders and give them confidence. The elders have a good mentality so far.</li>
<li>Question: If I want to reduce the Beta for the elders, when and how should I operate?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: It is generally recommended now that the Beta should not exceed 1.0 (such as 70/30). For an existing allocation of 1.2, it is recommended to evaluate it at the end of each year: if the market rises (such as 00662 returning to the level at the beginning of the year or higher), you can sell part of the leveraged position (00670L) and transfer the funds to cash (00865B), so that the cash ratio is adjusted to 30% or higher. If the market is down at the end of the year, then do not move. The goal is to gradually reduce the Beta to below 1.0. Before that, there is no need to consider complicated rebalancing strategies. Don&rsquo;t operate too frequently (once a year) to avoid increasing the elders&rsquo; anxiety (they may secretly look at the APP).</li>

<li>Question 1: Investing in QQQ in Canada, the teacher recommends QQC, etc., and mentions avoiding Hedged funds? It seems that most Canadian versions are Hedged? Which one should I choose? (Previously confused HXQ/HSQ).
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Recommend HXQ.t because it does not pay dividends, making tax treatment simpler. If you already hold QQC.to or ZQQ, there is no need to sell it, and new investments can be bought in HXQ.t. It is also acceptable if only Hedged versions are available locally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Please explain the asset allocation ratio (such as 70/30, 4:4:2). Time is limited (working, back problems requiring exercise, blood sugar problems), it is difficult to find specific content in videos, and listening to Clubhouse is also time-consuming.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: (Emphasizing the importance of learning, earning money from work only accounts for a small part of a lifetime of wealth, so you should spend time learning about investment) For ordinary investors working in Canada, the simplest allocation is: 70% HXQ.t + 30% cash/money market fund (Money Market). Check and adjust annually (sell the ones that have risen more to supplement cash, or use cash to buy the ones that have fallen more) to maintain this ratio.</li>
<li>(Nibalao Supplement): Canadian local stock dividends have tax advantages, while US-sourced dividends (such as QQC) are taxed (I don&rsquo;t know how much, but higher than Canadian stock taxes). I agree with the teacher&rsquo;s point of view: focus on investment returns is higher than focusing on work.</li>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Reiterating the advantage of HXQ.t not paying dividends. Canadian funds seem to be performing well, possibly because better compounding due to not paying dividends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing (Follow-up): Listening to the teacher&rsquo;s criticism is very comfortable and helpful. I am impatient, but after listening to the teacher&rsquo;s patient answers to &ldquo;stupid questions,&rdquo; I am more patient in helping others.

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Detailed comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin/cryptocurrencies and QQQ, based on his personal experience in the blockchain industry (entered the industry in 2017, experienced the blockchain/cryptocurrency community, ICO explosion, 2018 bear market):
<ul>
<li>Storage Security: BTC requires self-management of private keys/hardware wallets (cold wallets), which are easy to lose or damage, high risk; QQQ is托管ed by brokers, which is safe.</li>
<li>Transaction Security: BTC is vulnerable to hacker attacks, phishing, and platform crashes; QQQ is protected by regulations.</li>
<li>Staking/Liquidity: BTC lacks standardized and safe staking channels (DeFi is high risk); QQQ can be easily staked and borrowed (pledged) through brokers without selling.</li>
<li>Taxes: Selling BTC requires capital gains tax; holding QQQ for a long time and using pledges can avoid/defer taxes.</li>
<li>Legality: BTC has legal risks in China (trading and mining are illegal), and cashing out may be frozen; QQQ (and QDII 513100/513300) are legal and compliant.</li>
<li>Volatility/Risk: BTC is extremely volatile (short-term drops of 50-80% are common, such as an 85% drop in 2018), and ordinary people cannot withstand the mental stress; QQQ has a much lower frequency of large fluctuations.</li>
<li>Liquidity: The actual circulating volume of BTC is limited (locked by large holders, lost coins), which is not as high as the global liquidity of QQQ.</li>
<li>Practicality: Not detailed.</li>
<li>Future Returns: BTC has a high market value (nearly 2 trillion US dollars, comparable to top technology companies), and the possibility of super high multiple growth in the future is reduced (even if it rises to 200,000 US dollars/coin, it is only 2-3 times), and the rate of return may tend to be stable, lower than QQQ.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Cryptocurrencies are &ldquo;demons and ghosts,&rdquo; not suitable for ordinary investors, highly tempting but extremely risky.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>James&rsquo; Comment: Completely agree, cryptocurrencies should not be touched. Shared cases of others losing huge amounts of Bitcoin (equivalent to 15 million US dollars) due to unfamiliarity with cross-chain transfer rules (such as transferring between different chains or exchanges that do not support the target chain), emphasizing its complexity and risk (may be a technical problem or fraud).</li>

<p>The market is always fluctuating, the constant in the market is fluctuation, so fluctuation is certain to happen in the market, so you don&rsquo;t need to analyze where the fluctuation comes from&hellip; You see everyone talking so eloquently, in fact, he doesn&rsquo;t even know what he is talking about&hellip;
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: James emphasized the normality and unpredictability of market fluctuations, advising investors not to waste time analyzing the causes of short-term fluctuations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investment is buying with the intention of never selling, this is investment. Buying with the intention of selling at a high point is called speculation.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: James clearly distinguished the core criteria of investment and speculation: whether the purpose is to hold for the long term.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Making a decision about all investment and financial life is very simple, which is long-term, simple and effective&hellip; Convenience is a value. No trouble is a value.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When comparing 00864B and 00865B, James emphasized that choosing an investment method that is simpler and less troublesome in the long run has value in itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to risk the money you need for the money you don&rsquo;t need.
&ndash; James (quoting/paraphrasing Buffett&rsquo;s idea)</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Explained why even if it is judged that the market may rise, you should keep enough cash buffer (the money you need) and should not take too much risk for additional, potentially unnecessary returns (the money you don&rsquo;t need).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Later you will find that when humans develop to the extreme, food, clothing, housing, and transportation are all free, all free&hellip; Then what does it mean to be alive?&hellip; But what is the meaning of a dog? This may be the question that the last 80% of people have to think about.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When fantasizing about the future when AI is extremely developed, James raised the question of the profound crisis of existential meaning that humans (especially the majority who do not need to work) will face after material needs are completely satisfied.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest risk comes from [missing] the market&hellip; Focus on long-term returns, not this short-term [fluctuation].

<p>Context: Sharing the profound experience after reviewing the teacher&rsquo;s teachings when the market information is chaotic, emphasizing the importance of being in the market for a long time and focusing on long-term goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to be the first every time, we only want to be the third or fourth every time&hellip; Over the long term, we will be the first.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Using the analogy of racing to explain the logic of index investing: not pursuing short-term leadership, relying on continuous and steady performance, and ultimately winning in the long cycle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no house that cannot be sold, only a price that cannot be sold.
&ndash; Monmon</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Sharing the experience of selling a house, mentioning that applying this point of view ultimately successfully sold the property.</p>

<p>You should put your focus on investing, and the return is definitely much higher than if you put your focus on working.

<p>Context: When discussing that students do not have time to learn about investment, this student emphasized that based on their own experience, the long-term return of putting energy into investment learning far exceeds that of putting it into work itself.</p>

The core information is still focused on: adhering to long-term holding of high-quality index funds (especially the Nasdaq 100), understanding and accepting market fluctuations, maintaining rationality and patience, using time compounding, and conducting sound asset allocation according to personal risk tolerance (emphasizing the importance of at least 30% cash), and being vigilant about market noise and high-risk speculative products (such as cryptocurrencies). The Q&amp;A session answered in detail the specific questions encountered by students in different countries, different stages, and different product selections, and emphasized the importance of continuous learning of investment knowledge. Finally, it was reminded again that the Clubhouse will be suspended for the next two weeks.</p>

<p>This episode focuses on the mindset and strategies that investors should adopt in the context of current market volatility and volatile international situations. James emphasizes that for long-term investors, short-term market fluctuations, macroeconomic conditions, and even wars should not be of excessive concern. The core strategy should be to insist on buying high-quality index funds (such as Nasdaq 100 QQQ) and holding them for the long term, never selling. At the same time, he shares an updated Excel financial simulation tool, discusses pre-retirement withdrawal strategies, leverage management, the significant advantages of early Roth conversion, and how to build a strong investment psychology to cope with external pressure and complex information.</p>

<li><strong>Ignore the Noise, Keep Buying:</strong> Macro factors such as market volatility, international situations, tariff wars, trade wars, hot wars, and cold wars have little to do with long-term investing. Investors cannot and do not need to predict or respond to them. Just keep buying index funds (QQQ) and holding them for the long term.</li>
<li><strong>Halving is Inevitable:</strong> In the long-term investment process, a 50% or even greater reduction in assets is an inevitable event, not a matter of probability, but a certainty. Investors need to be psychologically prepared and ensure that they can still &ldquo;survive&rdquo; in this situation. Ask yourself every day: &ldquo;If the market halves again, can I still hold on?&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Long-Termism and Optimistic Mindset:</strong> Investing requires patience, and wealth is worth waiting for. The market always goes up in the long run. Investors should always be extremely optimistic, even if the market drops 80%, because the decline is part of the investment process, and the future is always bright. Buying is for future gains, not for leaving the market out of fear of future declines.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Origin and Background of the Problem:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some students reported problems with the old Excel version: 1) Increasing the spending ratio may actually reduce the final assets; 2) After a significant increase in assets (such as from 1 million to 4 million), spending directly at 2% of the new assets (i.e., 80,000) failed the stress test when simulating the 2000 tech bubble burst.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Main Updates and Usage Suggestions:</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Separating Spending and Rebalancing Ratios:</strong> Corrected the error of linking the spending ratio with the smart rebalancing ratio. The new version allows independent settings. It is recommended that the smart rebalancing ratio remain at 2% or be adjusted according to individual risk tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>New Strategy for Increasing Spending After Asset Growth (0.8% Rule):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simulation Conclusion:</strong> If assets increase significantly (such as from 1 million to 4.6 million, net worth 3.8 million, and borrowing 780,000 accounting for 17% of total assets), spending directly at 2% of the new assets (80,000/year) is too risky.</li>
<li><strong>Safety Recommendation:</strong> When assets have increased by more than <strong>2.5 times</strong> and the pledged loan ratio is controlled within <strong>20%</strong>, consider increasing the annual spending to <strong>0.7% or 0.8% of the new total assets</strong>. For example, assets of 4.6 million can spend about 36,800/year (4.6 million * 0.8%). After this adjustment, even if you encounter a market shock similar to 2000, you can maintain a sufficient margin of safety. This means that if assets grow 2.5 times, the annual spending can safely increase by about 2.2 times.</li>
<li><strong>Operation Guide (Using the &ldquo;Practice Version&rdquo; Excel):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Enter &ldquo;Scenario Nine&rdquo; (applicable to situations where you have started pledged borrowing and spending).</li>
<li>Modify the &ldquo;Amount Already Borrowed&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo; or &ldquo;Scenario Eight Nine Information&rdquo; area in the front of the table (<strong>do not directly change the S2 cell inside Excel, go to the overview page in front to change it</strong>).</li>
<li>Return to the scenario nine simulation page and modify the initial asset allocation ratio (such as QQQ 33%, QLD/Leverage 45%, Cash 22%).</li>
<li>Adjust the &ldquo;Borrowing Expenses&rdquo; percentage (located in column T, such as changing to 0.8 or 0.7).</li>
<li>Adjust the &ldquo;Borrowing Interest&rdquo; according to the actual situation (cell S5, such as setting it to 3% for Taiwan).</li>
<li>Observe the &ldquo;Minimum Maintenance Rate&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Minimum Equity Ratio&rdquo;) in the results and ensure that it is higher than your set safety threshold (such as 150% or 160%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cash Interest Assumption:</strong> When calculating the compound interest on the Cash portion in Excel, the interest rate used is half of the borrowing rate (S5) (i.e., <code>S5/2/12</code> calculated monthly). This is based on the conservative assumption that the deposit rate is usually lower than the borrowing rate and does not need to be modified.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Version Description:</strong> Provides &ldquo;Easy Version&rdquo; (only needs to fill in the initial total assets, smart rebalancing %, and annual spending %) and &ldquo;Practice Version&rdquo; (allows you to modify more detailed parameters inside Excel, such as initial allocation ratio, profit transfer ratio, initial borrowing ratio/amount, withholding cash ratio, etc.). To perform detailed simulations and parameter adjustments, you need to use the &ldquo;Practice Version.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario Analysis:</strong> Compare a couple aged 50 with 2 million in Traditional IRA, expected return of 14%, and tax rate of 24%, under three different Roth conversion strategies for the long term (to age 100).
<ul>
<li>Scenario 1: No conversion, relying on RMD. The final assets are approximately <strong>330 million</strong>.</li>
<li>Scenario 2: Work until age 56 and then start converting. The final assets are approximately <strong>350 million</strong>.</li>
<li>Scenario 3: Retire immediately at age 50 and start converting. The final assets are as high as <strong>780 million</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Core Conclusion:</strong> Retiring 6 years early to perform Roth conversion, utilizing the low tax bracket window in the early stage of retirement, can bring more than <strong>300 million USD</strong> in additional wealth. Even for high-income earners (assuming a conversion tax rate of 40%), it takes an additional 9-10 years of work to make up for the huge opportunity cost of not converting early. <strong>It is strongly recommended that those who meet the conditions plan and execute Roth conversion as soon as possible.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Make Good Use of Financial Tools (Transmissive Power):</strong> Specifically pointed out that Taiwan&rsquo;s low interest rate environment provides investors with favorable conditions to use borrowing (pledged loans, etc.) to amplify investment returns (transmissive power).</li>
<li><strong>Bank Perspective and Customer Relationships:</strong> Banks view deposits as liabilities and loans as assets. They are happy to see customers borrow and pay interest on time. Large borrowing customers are VIPs of the bank and enjoy preferential treatment; ordinary depositors need to go through regular procedures.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth Circulation Mechanism:</strong> Commercial banks play an intermediary role in the capitalist system, transferring the idle funds (deposits) of risk-averse/non-investors to investors (borrowers) who are willing to take risks and know how to use funds, and earn interest spreads from them. Understanding this mechanism helps investors use leverage more confidently.</li>

<li><strong>Decluttering and Value Ordering (Refer to Video 00351 &ldquo;Enlightenment&rdquo;):</strong>

<li><strong>Share:</strong> Taiwanese firefighter, 40 years old, new investor (started in February), adopting a 442 allocation (40% QQQ, 40% leverage, 20% cash), investing approximately 6 million. Recently experienced a large single-day drop of 28% in the leveraged portion, but stated that they could withstand it. Few friends shared the same philosophy. Believes that never selling can achieve financial freedom.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comments:</strong> Thank you for sharing. The 442 allocation is more aggressive, and this decline is a good stress test. Reminded that firefighting work is physically demanding, and investment should focus more on stability. Suggested adjusting the allocation according to their own comfort level, such as 433 or more conservative 424 or even 505. The primary goal of asset allocation is to make yourself &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; and able to hold it for the long term. Cash is the key to &ldquo;surviving.&rdquo; When facing external doubts, maintaining a strong inner self and confidence is the most important.</li>

<li><strong>Life Reflections:</strong> Reviewing last week&rsquo;s homework, combined with &ldquo;How Will You Measure Your Life?&rdquo; and Brian Dyson&rsquo;s five-ball theory, clarified that the second value of life is &ldquo;relationships,&rdquo; &ldquo;sense of contribution,&rdquo; and &ldquo;treating nature well&rdquo;; emphasized the irreplaceability of health, family, friendship, and soul; the current most wanted to get rid of is &ldquo;seeking recognition from others&rdquo;; believed that life regrets often stem from &ldquo;things not done.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Origin of Excel Questions:</strong> Deeply studied Excel and discovered problems due to concerns about smart rebalancing causing Beta to continue to rise (such as &gt;1.2) and wanting to increase living expenses (at 2% of new assets) after asset growth.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Can leveraged ETFs (such as 00670L) commonly used by Taiwanese investors be included in the Excel model to calculate the maintenance rate (market value)? If included, even with a higher Beta (such as 1.24), it seems that a 433 allocation can pass the test.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Philosophy of Life:</strong> Appreciated the in-depth thinking. Emphasized the importance of &ldquo;decluttering&rdquo; and clarifying &ldquo;what not to want.&rdquo; Agreed that there is no need for others to recognize, and shared that they value their relationship with their children the most. Recommended video 00351 &ldquo;Enlightenment.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Excel and Taiwan Applications:</strong> Theoretically, the market value of leveraged ETFs can be included in the maintenance rate calculation. The existing model is based on the US situation and is conservative (high interest rate assumptions, not explicitly including the market value of leverage), aimed at being universal and safe. Taiwanese investors can take advantage of the no capital gains tax (easy to reduce leverage) and lower interest rates, and modify Excel themselves (such as changing the interest rate and adjusting the maintenance rate formula) to better fit reality. If the model can pass, it is usually easier in Taiwan. Thanked them for their question, which prompted the optimization of the &ldquo;how to increase spending after asset growth&rdquo; strategy (0.7%-0.8% rule or reducing leverage).</li>

Glad that this decline occurred when the invested proportion was not yet high.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How to cope with this kind of caring pressure from relatives and friends (especially parents)? (Especially for office workers who cannot physically avoid it like retirees).
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Cannot control others, only cultivate the inner self. From shielding information (&ldquo;not listening, not seeing, does not exist&rdquo;) to the inner self not being disturbed (&ldquo;both seeing and listening but also does not exist&rdquo;). The key is to have firm self-belief, understand the current situation, and show confidence to the outside world (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine&rdquo;). The decline is the norm for investing, or a good opportunity to rebalance. When the inner self is strong enough to realize a certain illusion of the external world, its influence can be reduced.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Macro Level:</strong> Refer to video 00430C. Admitted that global competition is intensifying, but the US has not declined, and the foundation of technological strength remains. The US democratic system has resilience and self-correcting ability, and there is no need to be overly pessimistic due to short-term policies or personnel changes.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Indicators:</strong> The criteria for judgment is the composition of the top ten technology companies in the world by market value. If it is still dominated by the United States, then there is no need to change the strategy. If the future pattern changes significantly (such as non-US companies accounting for more than half), consider adjusting the proportion accordingly. Unlikely to happen within 50 years.</li>
<li><strong>Specific Concerns:</strong> Much information may be amplified or biased (information cocoon effect). Believe in the basic integrity system and institutional resilience of American society.

<blockquote>
<p>Market volatility, international situations, trade wars, hot and cold wars&hellip; have nothing to do with our investment, just buy, don&rsquo;t sell. Long-term is investment.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Emphasizes that long-term investment should focus on holding high-quality assets, ignoring short-term market noise and macro events.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will definitely encounter several opportunities for asset depreciation of 50% in the market, this is not a probability problem, this is a certainty.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Reminds investors that a significant market correction is an inevitable part of long-term investment and that they need to be psychologically and financially prepared for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asset allocation is not done for performance, asset allocation is done for your comfort.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Explains that the primary goal of asset allocation (especially the proportion of cash holdings) is to ensure that investors can hold it with peace of mind and get through the cycle, rather than simply pursuing the highest returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commercial banks are intermediaries that transfer the money of the poor to the rich for use, and this revolving door takes place in banks. This is the reason why the capitalist system makes the poor poorer and the rich richer.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Reveals the core role of the modern banking system in capital flow and its impact on the wealth distribution pattern.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who borrow money are VIPs&hellip; those who don&rsquo;t have much money and don&rsquo;t borrow money, please go to the counter to draw a number and line up.

<p>Background: Vividly compares the vast difference in the way banks treat large borrowing customers and ordinary depositors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You push out all the things you don&rsquo;t want first&hellip; then what are the things you have left that you want? It&rsquo;s very little&hellip; the less you want, the less homework you have.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Applies the concept of &ldquo;decluttering&rdquo; to life planning, advocating that by reducing desires and unnecessary pursuits, inner freedom and focus can be achieved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are besieged by the network and locked in an information prison, you can&rsquo;t break out&hellip; all our thoughts are not our thoughts&hellip; we are all parrots.

<p>Background: Deeply warns of the erosion of individual cognition and independent thinking ability by &ldquo;information cocoons,&rdquo; calling for vigilance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both seeing and listening but also does not exist.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Describes an advanced state of psychological practice, where even when exposed to negative or disturbing information, the inner self can remain calm and unaffected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things that have happened in the past are less worried about, we are worried about things that have never happened before.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Distinguishes between known and unknown risks, pointing out that historical experience helps to deal with recurring crises, but the real challenge lies in dealing with new, unknown shocks.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This lecture, against the background of increased market volatility, strengthened the core concept of long-term investment: ignore the noise and insist on holding high-quality index funds (QQQ). James not only updated and explained in detail the important financial planning tool Excel model (especially the adjustment of withdrawal strategies after asset growth), but also persuasively demonstrated the amazing value of doing Roth conversion as early as possible. At a deeper level, the course focused on the construction of investment psychology, discussed how to understand and use financial system rules, how to cope with external pressure (worries from relatives and friends, social information) with a strong inner self, and especially emphasized the extreme importance of maintaining independent thinking and being wary of &ldquo;information cocoons&rdquo; in the era of information explosion. The ultimate goal is to help investors cultivate both their inner skills and achieve a double improvement in cognition and mindset on the road to pursuing financial freedom.</p>
