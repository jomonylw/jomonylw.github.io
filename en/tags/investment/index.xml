</h3>
<p>Li Ka-shing, ranked among the top ten wealthiest Chinese in the world with a fortune of nearly $7 billion, is the chairman of Cheung Kong Holdings and Hutchison Whampoa Limited in Hong Kong. His legendary journey to wealth and his influence in Hong Kong&rsquo;s political and business circles have earned him another nickname ‚Äî &ldquo;Superman Li.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Capitalizing on the Plunging Property Market</strong></p>
<p>In 1939, 12-year-old Li Ka-shing moved to Hong Kong from his hometown of Chao&rsquo;an, Guangdong, with his father. After two years of schooling, Hong Kong fell due to the Pacific War. The following year, his father died of a serious illness, forcing Li Ka-shing, the eldest son, to drop out of school and support his family. After Hong Kong&rsquo;s liberation in 1945, he ended his odd-job career and became a salesman at a plastics factory, working over 16 hours a day. Three years later, at the age of 20, he was promoted to general manager. Two years after that, he used all his savings of HK$7,000 to start his own small plastics factory, &ldquo;Cheung Kong Industries,&rdquo; the predecessor of today&rsquo;s largest conglomerate in Hong Kong, Cheung Kong Holdings.</p>
<p>How did Li Ka-shing, without even a primary school diploma, take his first step toward becoming the richest man by producing plastic flowers? In 1958, due to a rent increase by the landlord of his factory, Li Ka-shing bought a piece of land in North Point and built his own factory. In the early 1960s, the plastic flower industry declined, and in 1967, Hong Kong property prices plummeted. Li Ka-shing seized the opportunity to acquire land at low prices. In 1972, the Hong Kong stock market soared, and Cheung Kong Industries went public, taking advantage of the opportunity to raise capital from the public to purchase more land. In the 10 years following the completion of his first factory in 1958, his real estate holdings increased 50-fold. Cheung Kong now holds approximately 1.48 million square meters of floor space. Li Ka-shing has been investing in real estate for over 40 years, and long-term investment has accumulated his enormous wealth.</p>
<p>Having strived for 50 years and achieved success in wealth accumulation, Li Ka-shing has unique insights into success. He said: &ldquo;Before the age of 20, 100% of career success comes from hard work; between 20 and 30, when a career has some foundation, 10% of success depends on good luck, and 90% still comes from diligence; after 30, the proportion of opportunity gradually increases; now, luck accounts for about 30% to 40%.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same applies to wealth accumulation. Before 20, all money comes from hard work; between 20 and 30 is the time to work hard to earn and save money; after 30, the importance of investment and financial management gradually increases. By middle age, the money earned is less important, and how to manage money becomes more critical. Li Ka-shing has been fighting for his wealth all his life. To become rich, one must have enough patience.</p>
<p><strong>The Power of Compound Interest Takes Time</strong></p>
<p>Many people who have heard my lectures often ask the same questions: &ldquo;Saving 14,000 yuan a year to become a billionaire is indeed impressive, but according to your method, it takes 40 years, which is really discouraging!&rdquo; &ldquo;It takes 40 years to become a billionaire. By then, I might be dead. What&rsquo;s the point of having billions then?&rdquo; &ldquo;Can you teach some secrets to getting rich quickly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even I feel that 40 years is too long. At the repeated requests of the audience, I did spend some time studying this issue in depth. The result of the research is: <strong>Financial management requires a long time, and the effect is not visible in the short term.  It is impossible to get rich quickly through financial management.</strong></p>
<p>If someone starts now and saves 14,000 yuan at the end of each year, and if the money saved each year can be invested in stocks or real estate with an average annual return of 20%, we know that the wealth will grow to 102.81 million yuan after 40 years. Now, let&rsquo;s ask: How much wealth can he accumulate after 10 years? Most people think that with such a high return, even with a shorter time, after 10 years of compounding, it should be at least 5 million yuan, some even guess 10 million, and the most conservative guess is 1 million.  Similarly, this is a surprising answer: 360,000 yuan! The following calculation formula should be familiar to readers, but they will be surprised that the amount is so small.</p>

<p>With the same 20% return, 14,000 yuan per year results in 102.81 million yuan after 40 years of financial management, but only 360,000 yuan after 10 years, which is unbelievable! The difference is more than 300 times! Fortunately, this concept is presented to readers in a timely manner. Otherwise, if readers use the methods mentioned in this book, save 14,000 yuan every year, and invest all of it in stocks, thinking that they can become billionaires, they would be shocked to find that after ten years of hard work, with an average annual return of 20%, they have only accumulated 360,000 yuan! They might feel cheated.  After struggling for 10 years, they can&rsquo;t even afford a car, let alone become billionaires!</p>
<p>What is 10 years? Ten years is a long time. After 10 years of struggle, there&rsquo;s only a little over 300,000 yuan. How discouraging! This is the frustration one inevitably encounters in the process of accumulating wealth through investment and financial management.  Investors must understand that financial management is a &ldquo;marathon&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;sprint.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s about endurance, not explosive power.</p>
<p>The prerequisite for getting rich through investment and financial management is time, and a long time. You must go through a very long waiting period before you can see the results. If the invested capital is small, no results will be seen after 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Earning Your Second 10 Million is Easier Than the First 1 Million</strong></p>
<p>Saving 14,000 yuan at the end of each year with an average investment return of 20%, even after 20 years, the assets will only accumulate to 2.61 million yuan.  At this point, one is still far from being a billionaire. It takes 30 years to accumulate 16.55 million yuan, barely reaching the millionaire level.  Only after 40 years of continuous struggle can one become a billionaire with 102.81 million yuan.</p>

<p>From the table above, we can see: by saving 14,000 yuan annually with a 20% investment return, the wealth increased by 360,000 yuan in the first decade, 2.25 million yuan in the second decade, 13.94 million yuan in the third decade, and 86.26 million yuan in the fourth decade.

<p>A self-made man who got rich by investing in stocks once told me: &ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;ve made it, a stock price increase can easily bring in millions of yuan. Making money has suddenly become so easy, it&rsquo;s unstoppable. Thinking back to the days when I first entered the stock market 30 years ago, it took a lot of hard work to earn tens of thousands of yuan. I really don&rsquo;t know where the money went back then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This experience is not unfamiliar to many who have struggled to build their fortunes from scratch.  Everything is difficult at the beginning.  During the initial struggle, money is hard to earn.  It takes a lot of effort to earn just tens of thousands of yuan. It&rsquo;s puzzling why money is so hard to earn.  Until success is achieved, and money comes rolling in, one wonders why making money has become so easy.</p>
<p><strong>Time is the Stepping Stone to Wealth Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>Everyone desires the ability to effortlessly earn their second million or ten million, reaching a state of abundant wealth.  The problem is, before earning the second million, you need to have the first million. But how can you earn the first million?  If you want to accumulate 1 million through investment and financial management, you need &ldquo;time.&rdquo; You have to go through a long period of hardship. If you can endure the difficult period of earning the first million, you can naturally enjoy the ease of earning the second million.</p>
<p>From the compound interest formula, we can see that time is an indispensable factor for compound interest to take effect.  Patient waiting is a prerequisite for investment and financial management.  Especially for wealth accumulation through financial management, the required patience is not a few months or years, but at least two or three decades, or even four or five decades.</p>
<p>The vast majority of wealthy people accumulate their huge fortunes gradually from small amounts of money over a long period. In the beginning, most people have very little capital, even negligible. However, success is woven from a series of small achievements. Great wealth is the accumulation of small wealth, coupled with the effect of compound interest.</p>
<p>The importance of time in investment and financial management is evident. Patience is essential for financial management. The more patient you are in enduring the long waiting period, the greater the power of wealth creation will be. This is the characteristic of &ldquo;compound interest.&rdquo; However, today we live in a &ldquo;fast food&rdquo; culture where everything emphasizes speed and efficiency: fast food restaurants for meals, express delivery for mail, highways for driving, one-hour photo processing, and crash courses for learning. People have become increasingly impatient and short-sighted, lacking patience.  In investment and financial management, they are also impatient and lack patience, wanting to see results immediately.  It may be more efficient to pursue speed in other matters, but investment and financial management cannot be rushed. Time is a necessary condition for financial management. The more you rush, the less you achieve.  Based on my observations, a common mistake among investors is giving up halfway. They get easily discouraged during bear markets and simply sell their stocks and real estate, completely leaving the stock and property markets, not knowing that lack of patience and perseverance makes it difficult to achieve anything.</p>

<p><strong>The Real Estate Investment Experience of Madam Chang Yao-Hung-Ying, Chairperson of Grand Pacific Construction</strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Land I bought for hundreds of thousands in the past is now worth hundreds of millions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Madam Chang Yao-Hung-Ying, chairperson of Grand Pacific Construction, pointed out: In the 1930s, a mainlander investing in land in Taiwan was often ridiculed. But it was with this small capital and perseverance that Madam Chang Yao-Hung-Ying, who left Shanghai for Taiwan in 1947, when her husband became disillusioned with his business, saw the development potential of Taiwan. She picked up their real estate business skills from Shanghai and started buying land.</p>
<p>After more than 40 years, her long-term investment in real estate finally paid off.  Her family&rsquo;s business is growing bigger and bigger, and they now own two listed companies: ASE Technology Holding and Grand Pacific Construction. ASE Technology Holding is now the second largest packaging factory in the world. As for Grand Pacific Construction, it launched the Earl&rsquo;s Court project in Xizhi in 1987, which boosted the real estate market in Xizhi and rapidly accumulated their family&rsquo;s wealth, making them one of the richest families in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Madam Chang Yao-Hung-Ying has now passed the baton to her son, Jason Chang. Jason Chang, chairman of ASE Technology Holding, seems to have inherited his mother&rsquo;s investment acumen. He&rsquo;s the kind of person who buys land wherever he goes, whether it&rsquo;s in Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China, or the United States. Perhaps in another two or three decades, Jason Chang will also say: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect that the land I bought for a few million back then would now be worth tens of billions.&rdquo;  However, Jason Chang&rsquo;s wealth accumulation speed will be much faster than his mother&rsquo;s because he has already laid a good foundation.  All he needs to do is go with the flow, and his wealth will increase geometrically, with money rolling in, unstoppable.</p>
<p><strong>Withstanding the Test of Time is the True Measure</strong></p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s not your judgment that makes you a lot of money, but your patience.</em></p>
<p>A crucial factor in financial management is time. Without a correct understanding of it, impatience will naturally arise.  Impatience leads to taking significant risks, turning potential success into failure.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the accumulation of wealth or experience, it&rsquo;s not something that can be accomplished overnight. It takes time. Fortunately, God is very fair in this regard. Regardless of whether one is born rich or poor, noble or humble, everyone has only 24 hours a day and an average lifespan of about 75 years. Time is the greatest wealth in life, and a person&rsquo;s honor, status, wealth, and happiness all depend on how they use this wealth.</p>
<p>To accumulate wealth through investment and financial management, time is an indispensable factor. It cannot be rushed.  Investment and financial management can lead to slow and steady wealth accumulation, but investing small amounts of money and wanting to earn billions of wealth in a short period is, I can say with certainty, &ldquo;impossible!&rdquo; Just imagine, can a mother give birth without going through ten months of pregnancy? Can a farmer shorten the growth period of rice seedlings?</p>
<p>The growth of wealth is like the growth of life.  It&rsquo;s formed bit by bit, day by day, month by month, year by year, under the effect of compound interest.  It cannot be achieved overnight. This is the law of nature, and God never changes his natural laws.</p>
<p><strong>Luck is Not a Long-Term Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Many investors make a fortune overnight and go bankrupt overnight. Their success is due to luck, and their failure is because &ldquo;you may be lucky for a while, but you cannot always be lucky.&rdquo; <strong>Any investment opportunity that promises overnight riches must hide a greater risk of overnight poverty.</strong> This is why most of those who fantasize about getting rich quickly through financial management end up losing everything.</p>
<p>As long as you are patient and invest your assets in the right investment vehicles, you don&rsquo;t need to actively manage or worry. Compound interest will naturally lead to wealth growth, and becoming a billionaire over time is almost a certainty. In investment and financial management, haste makes waste. &ldquo;Fast&rdquo; is definitely not good!</p>
<p>If you really want to get rich quickly, I suggest you try entrepreneurship instead of investment and financial management. If any of the readers want to get rich quickly, what should they do?  My sincere suggestion is to choose the path of entrepreneurship. I have studied the wealth accumulation process of many rich people throughout history and found that there are many examples of getting rich quickly through entrepreneurship. Bill Gates, the richest man in the United States, dropped out of college in his freshman year to found Microsoft and became the richest man in the United States in just 20 years.</p>
<p>However, the probability of success in getting rich through entrepreneurship is extremely low.  According to statistics from the Taiwan Entrepreneurship Association, the success rate of a person&rsquo;s first business venture is only about 7%, and entrepreneurial success does not necessarily mean getting rich. In other words, for every successful entrepreneur we see, there are at least dozens of unknown failures behind them.  Moreover, the entrepreneurial process is very arduous. Working more than ten hours a day seems to be a prerequisite for successful entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>On the contrary, as long as the method is correct, investing money in the stock market and property market, and waiting patiently for decades, the probability of getting rich through investment and financial management is very high. It&rsquo;s hard not to get rich, and the process is relatively easy and enjoyable!  Which method you choose to get rich is up to you. I must emphasize again that there is a possibility of getting rich quickly through entrepreneurship, but it is absolutely impossible to get rich quickly through financial management.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a parable in the Bible about financial stewardship. A landowner entrusted his property to three servants. He gave the first servant five units of money, the second two, and the third one. He told them to cherish and manage their wealth wisely, and he would return in a year to see how they had fared.</p>
<p><strong>Wasting Time and Money</strong></p>
<p>The first servant invested his money; the second bought raw materials and produced goods to sell; the third, for safety, buried his money under a tree. A year later, the landowner returned.  The first two servants had doubled their wealth, pleasing the landowner.  Only the third servant&rsquo;s money remained unchanged. He explained, &ldquo;Fearing loss through mismanagement, I kept the money safe. Today, I return it untouched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landowner was furious.  &ldquo;You lazy servant!&rdquo; he scolded. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t even try to utilize your wealth!&rdquo;  Wealth not utilized is wasted money and wasted potential. The third servant was rebuked not for misusing the money, nor for losing it through failed investments, but for keeping it &ldquo;safe&rdquo; and unproductive.</p>
<p>Keeping money in the bank is the most common approach to personal finance today, and also the biggest mistake people make.  Therefore, the first and most important financial rule this book offers is: <em>Don&rsquo;t keep your money in the bank.</em>  &ldquo;Bank&rdquo; here refers to post offices, commercial banks, and any other financial institution where money can be deposited.</p>
<p>Many believe that earning interest in a bank, benefiting from compound interest, constitutes sound financial planning. In reality, with inflation, the real rate of return is close to zero, meaning no real financial gain. Therefore, leaving money in the bank is equivalent to no financial management at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to predict how much wealth each person will accumulate through financial management. The only certainty is that getting rich solely through bank savings is incredibly difficult.  Ask yourself, &ldquo;Have you ever heard of anyone getting rich purely from bank deposits?&rdquo;  Those who keep all their savings in the bank often find themselves not only failing to become wealthy in their old age but also struggling to maintain financial independence. Such stories are common.  Those who choose bank deposits as their primary financial management method do so primarily for safety. However, readers must understand:  <strong>&ldquo;Money in the bank is safest in the short term, but the most dangerous form of financial management in the long term.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Blind Spots in Personal Finance</strong></p>
<p><em>Most people manage their finances by keeping their money in the bank, so most people are not wealthy.</em></p>
<p>If accumulating immense wealth were as easy as the examples suggest, then most people over 65 today would be millionaires. However, this is far from reality.  Millionaires over 65 are few and far between, with many senior citizens facing financial hardship, relying on continued work or support from their children to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Surveys on the elderly in Taiwan reveal increasingly serious financial challenges for senior citizens.  Among approximately 1.48 million people aged 65 and above, about 13% rely on financial assistance from family and friends or social welfare.  This demonstrates a serious problem with most people&rsquo;s financial concepts and investment methods. How else could they reach old age not only without wealth but without even basic financial independence?</p>
<p>Taiwan&rsquo;s savings rate has historically been above 30%, currently hovering between 20% and 30%, consistently ranking among the highest globally. This indicates excellent performance in saving and budgeting. Consequently, we can deduce that flawed financial management is the primary reason for the lack of financial independence among ordinary people. To understand where they go wrong, we must first observe how they handle their assets. In various lectures, I often ask the audience, &ldquo;How are your assets stored?&rdquo;  The majority answer: &ldquo;In the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Prioritizing Security over Investment</strong></p>
<p>Surveys on Taiwanese household investment preferences reveal that the top three investment choices are demand deposits (72%), rotating savings and credit associations (53%), and time deposits (36%). Clearly, most people lean towards traditional financial methods.  Furthermore, when asked, &ldquo;If you had 10 million Taiwan dollars in savings, how would you use it?&rdquo;, about 41% of surveyed households said they would deposit it in a financial institution to earn interest. This illustrates the widespread preference for bank savings.</p>
<p>Indeed, people have high savings rates and a strong preference for depositing money in financial institutions to earn interest.  In early 1996, total deposits in Taiwanese financial institutions reached 12.6 trillion Taiwan dollars.  With a population of 21 million, this translates to an average deposit of 600,000 Taiwan dollars per person, regardless of age.  For an average family of four, this amounts to 2.4 million Taiwan dollars.  This demonstrates a strong inclination towards bank savings. However, this traditional and conservative approach is the primary reason why most people fail to achieve wealth through investment.</p>
<p>This phenomenon reveals an over-reliance on traditional bank deposits for financial management. People prioritize safety and convenience over the rate of return. However, focusing solely on earning and saving money, then depositing it in a bank, is often the first step towards financial mismanagement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keeping money in the bank is like having no financial plan at all.</p>

</h3>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with bank deposits? The problem lies in the low interest rates (return on investment), making them unsuitable for long-term investment tools.</p>
<p>How much interest can bank deposits earn?  The salaries of average office workers are usually directly deposited into demand deposit accounts (current interest rates around 2%-4%). A portion serves as temporary funds or covers daily expenses, while the remainder is transferred to time deposits (current interest rates around 5%-8%) for investment purposes. Thus, the average interest rate earned on bank deposits is about 5%.</p>
<p><strong>5% Interest is Hardly a Path to Wealth</strong></p>
<p>Most people have a basic understanding of compound interest, believing that interest earned on bank deposits, accumulating over time, can create substantial wealth. This misconception arises from a superficial understanding of compounding.  The vast differences in final returns resulting from different rates of return on the same principal over the same period often come as a surprise.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s illustrate with an example. Suppose someone saves 14,000 Taiwan dollars annually at the end of each year for 40 years, depositing everything into a bank account with an average interest rate of 5%. How much will they accumulate after 40 years? Before answering, recall the similar example from the previous section, but with the money in a bank instead of invested in stocks or real estate with an average annual return of 20%.</p>
<p>You might guess 25 million, 10 million, or even a conservative 5 million Taiwan dollars.  The correct answer, however, is only 1.69 million.  This can be calculated using the future value of an annuity formula:</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mtable displaystyle="true" columnalign="right center left" columnspacing="0 thickmathspace" rowspacing="3pt"><mtr><mtd><mn>14,000</mn><mo>√ó</mo><mfrac><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0.05</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>40</mn></mrow></msup><mo>‚àí</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mn>0.05</mn></mfrac></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>1,690,000</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mn>14,000</mn><mo>√ó</mo><mfrac><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0.20</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>40</mn></mrow></msup><mo>‚àí</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mn>0.20</mn></mfrac></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>102,810,000</mn></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare this with the 20% return scenario.  The only difference between the two formulas is the rate of return (5% vs. 20%). A 20% return over 40 years yields 102.81 million Taiwan dollars, while a 5% return over the same period yields only 1.69 million, less than a fraction of the former. The difference is over 60 times! This illustrates the power of compound interest.  Many assume they benefit from compound interest in a bank, but at a 5% return, even with compounding over a long period, the wealth creation effect is very limited.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates that one of the keys to successful financial management is the rate of return. The key is not just whether your assets are invested, but <em>where</em> they are invested and what the rate of return is.</p>

<p>Forty years ago, a millionaire was truly wealthy.  Today, a millionaire might struggle to afford a house. Why?  Inflation.  Every investor must consider the impact of inflation.</p>
<p><em>Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money and lowers the real rate of return, diminishing the effect of wealth accumulation.</em></p>
<p>Over the past 30 years, the average annual inflation rate in Taiwan has been around 5%. What about the future?  Inflation and economic growth are closely linked. As Taiwan&rsquo;s economy continues to grow, inflation is expected to remain around 5% annually.</p>
<p>Inflation means continuously rising prices, which translates to decreasing purchasing power.  If you keep your money in a demand deposit account earning 4% interest with a 5% inflation rate, what happens?  Your purchasing power decreases.  The longer your money sits in a savings account, the less it&rsquo;s worth.  What used to cost 10 Taiwan dollars for a newspaper now costs 15. Your 10 dollars can now only buy two-thirds of a newspaper. With inflation, money in the bank shrinks like wool submerged in water.</p>
<p><strong>Saving Alone Won&rsquo;t Make You Rich, Not Even in Two Lifetimes</strong></p>
<p>With 5% inflation and a nominal interest rate of around 5% on bank deposits, your real rate of return is zero. In this scenario, the effect of compound interest is nullified.  Wealth accumulation relies solely on painstaking saving. Imagine someone saves 500,000 Taiwan dollars a year. How long would it take to become a billionaire?  200 years!</p>
<p>Saving 500,000 Taiwan dollars a year is difficult; living for 200 years is even harder!  Therefore, even with diligent saving and budgeting, if all the money is kept in the bank, this person won&rsquo;t become wealthy in this lifetime, and worse, not even in the next! The average lifespan is around 75 years, meaning two lifetimes total only 150 years.  It would take a third lifetime for someone relying solely on bank savings to potentially reach billionaire status.  If a family maintains the financial strategy of &ldquo;frugality and bank savings,&rdquo; it would take at least 200 years, or about seven generations, for them to potentially become wealthy.  Conversely, with proper financial management, wealth can be achieved in 40 years (half a lifetime).</p>
<p><strong>Money in the Bank Should Be Spent Sooner Rather Than Later</strong></p>
<p>I remember 30 years ago, when I was in second or third grade, a popsicle cost 20 cents, and a red bean ice cream cost 50 cents.  My parents gave me 50 cents each day for allowance, which I invariably spent on red bean ice cream after school. My parents constantly encouraged me to save, so my father opened a bank account for me. If I had been obedient and developed good saving habits from a young age, saving those 50 cents daily and earning 8% interest, it would have grown tenfold over 30 years, to 5 Taiwan dollars.  However, a red bean ice cream now costs 15 Taiwan dollars. Those 5 dollars can only buy one-third of a red bean ice cream. More importantly, for aÂ∞èÂ≠¶Áîü 30 years ago, a red bean ice cream was precious.  Even a dozen red bean ice creams today couldn&rsquo;t compare to the value of one back then. Had I followed my parents&rsquo; financial advice and kept my money in the bank, I would regret it now.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you&rsquo;re going to keep money in the bank, my sincere advice is: &ldquo;Spend it sooner rather than later!&rdquo; This might sound shocking, but there&rsquo;s logic to it.  From an economic perspective, money has more value and higher utility when used sooner. We save money in the bank, delaying gratification for the sake of greater enjoyment in the future.  However, with inflation, money left in the bank often leads to <em>less</em> enjoyment.</p>
<p><strong>The Value of Money Decreases with Age</strong></p>
<p>My wife and her friends developed a financial philosophy: &ldquo;Money is most valuable when spent while young.&rdquo; This makes economic sense.  Their reasoning: &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re old, delicacies might harm your health, traveling becomes difficult, and most importantly, wearing beautiful clothes attracts unwanted attention and ridicule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, everyone managing their finances must be mindful of the dual pressures of inflation and the diminishing value of money with age. Bank deposit interest rates cannot compensate for these losses. In other words, <strong>money in the bank, while nominally increasing, actually decreases in value.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m not encouraging you to spend all your savings immediately.  Rather, I&rsquo;m highlighting that if you keep money in the bank, you must consider the declining purchasing power due to inflation and the reduced economic benefit as you age.  The fundamental solution is to withdraw your money from the bank and invest it in instruments with higher returns than bank deposit rates. <strong>Therefore, the best way to combat inflation is: Don&rsquo;t keep your money in the bank. Invest in long-term, high-return assets like stocks and real estate.</strong></p>
<p>Because inflation decreases real returns and hinders wealth accumulation, even saving 14,000 Taiwan dollars annually and investing in stocks or real estate for 40 years to become a billionaire won&rsquo;t carry the same weight as being a billionaire today.  Therefore, under inflation, consider using the <em>real</em> rate of return. If the return on investment is 20% and inflation is 5%, the real return is 15%.  So how much should you save annually, investing in stocks or real estate with a nominal return of around 20% (real return of 15%), to become a billionaire in 40 years?  The answer is 57,000 Taiwan dollars per year.</p>

</h3>
<p>Chang Po-hsin, the current standing director of Chang Hwa Bank, with assets exceeding tens of billions, inherited and expanded upon the fortune of his father, Chang Pin-san, the former chairman of Chang Hwa Bank, earning him a place among Taiwan&rsquo;s wealthiest individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Trading Bank Deposits for Stock Dividends</strong></p>
<p>Forty years ago, both Chang Pin-san and my father were from Nantun District, Taichung City.  They were not only fellow townsmen but also colleagues. Back then, Chang Pin-san was just a junior manager at Chang Hwa Bank, without much wealth.  However, he borrowed money to buy Chang Hwa Bank shares from colleagues who wanted to sell them. At the time, stock dividends were far lower than bank interest. Despite this, Chang Pin-san persisted in borrowing money to acquire shares, holding onto them for the long term.  Other colleagues deposited the proceeds from their stock sales into banks. Years later, Chang Pin-san, owning the most shares, became the largest shareholder and eventually the chairman of Chang Hwa Bank, laying the foundation for his immense wealth.</p>
<p>Chang Pin-san was also friends with Lien Chen-tung, father of Lien Chan, and encouraged him to buy Chang Hwa Bank shares. The Lien family&rsquo;s fortune also originated from those hundreds of Chang Hwa Bank shares.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe that the path to wealth could be so simple: borrow money to buy a few Chang Hwa Bank shares, invest in some real estate, hold them long-term, and essentially forget about them.  Decades later, great wealth is attained. Those who sold their shares and deposited the money in banks are still wondering how others became rich. Some might attribute this to luck, but financial management is not about luck.  It&rsquo;s about the method chosen and the investment tools selected.  Therefore, if you don&rsquo;t want to be poor, don&rsquo;t keep your money in the bank.</p>
<p><strong>Bank Savings Shouldn&rsquo;t Exceed Living Expenses</strong></p>
<p>Someone once jokingly asked me, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling us not to keep money in the bank.  Are we supposed to pay with stocks or real estate certificates at the supermarket or restaurant?&rdquo; Of course not!  Advising against keeping money in the bank doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t have any money in the bank at all. Bank deposits offer advantages: security and convenience. They are ideal for storing funds needed for daily expenses. However, you can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too.  Convenience comes at the cost of high returns.</p>
<p>The wise approach is to clearly divide funds into two categories: daily expenses and investments.  Keep enough for daily needs in the bank, enjoying the security and convenience it offers. Invest the rest in higher-return assets like stocks and real estate.</p>
<p>In my opinion, keeping the equivalent of two months&rsquo; living expenses in the bank is sufficient for an individual or family. Most individuals and families receive regular income, which is deposited into their bank accounts. Therefore, one month&rsquo;s expenses for immediate use and another month&rsquo;s worth as a safety net should be ample.  The remaining funds should be invested in higher-return assets like stocks and real estate.  In other words, if your monthly expenses average 50,000 Taiwan dollars, and your bank balance consistently exceeds 100,000, you are not managing your finances effectively.  Actively seek suitable investment opportunities to make your surplus funds work for you.</p>
<p><strong>The &ldquo;Two Big, One Small&rdquo; Approach to Flexible Fund Management</strong></p>
<p>Some believe in maintaining substantial emergency funds. However, even if unforeseen circumstances drain your bank savings, there&rsquo;s no need to panic. The high-return investments mentioned earlier‚Äîstocks and real estate‚Äîare not as illiquid as some might think.  Listed stocks in Taiwan&rsquo;s active stock market can be sold almost any day of the year (excluding holidays), providing quick access to cash within a few days.  Reluctant to sell? Stocks can also be used as collateral for loans.</p>
<p>Real estate is less liquid than stocks, but many Taiwanese banks now offer &ldquo;revolving mortgage loans,&rdquo; allowing property owners to convert fixed assets into liquid assets. These loans involve mortgaging a property to secure a credit line of up to 70%-75% of the property&rsquo;s value. Borrowers can draw and repay funds as needed, with interest accruing only on the outstanding balance. For example, a 10 million Taiwan dollar property could secure a 7.5 million credit line.  Borrowing 5 million leaves 2.5 million available without interest charges, with interest accruing only on the 5 million borrowed.  Any surplus funds can be used to repay the loan, reducing interest costs.</p>
<p>Many financial experts recommend a &ldquo;three-part&rdquo; approach, dividing assets equally among bank savings, real estate, and more speculative investments. I propose a &ldquo;two big, one small&rdquo; approach: allocate most of your assets to stocks and real estate, keeping a small portion in a bank for daily expenses.  This isn&rsquo;t my invention. In fact, this is the portfolio strategy employed by many who have achieved wealth through investments.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Keeping money in the bank is the riskiest form of financial management.  Inflation erodes returns, leaving real interest rates near zero.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Banks offer convenience, not high returns.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>Keep only two months&rsquo; worth of living expenses in the bank.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>Trying to get rich with money in the bank is like trying to win a baseball game without swinging the bat.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If all this hasn&rsquo;t convinced you to reconsider keeping most of your money in a financial institution, perhaps the story of the Nobel Prize Foundation&rsquo;s success might change your mind.</p>

<p>Every October, the Nobel Committee announces the Nobel laureates. The Nobel Prize attracts global attention not only for representing the highest academic honor but also because each laureate receives a substantial prize of 1 million US dollars.</p>
<p><strong>The Folly of Depleting Capital</strong></p>
<p>The Nobel Foundation awards several prizes annually, disbursing millions of dollars. This raises the question: How large is the Nobel fund to sustain such substantial payouts? The Nobel Foundation&rsquo;s success, besides the substantial initial donation by Alfred Nobel over a century ago, is largely attributed to its shrewd financial management.</p>
<p>Established in 1896 with a 9.8 million US dollar donation from Nobel, the foundation&rsquo;s purpose is to fund the prizes.  Flawless fund management was paramount.  Initially, its charter stipulated that investments be restricted to safe, fixed-income instruments like bank deposits and government bonds, explicitly excluding stocks and real estate to avoid market risks.</p>
<p>This capital preservation approach, prioritizing safety over returns, seemed prudent, preventing losses. However, sacrificing returns had consequences.  After 50 years of prize payouts and operating expenses, low returns depleted two-thirds of the Nobel fund, leaving only a little over 3 million US dollars by 1953.</p>
<p><strong>From 3 Million to 270 Million: The Secret</strong></p>
<p>Facing depletion, the Nobel Foundation&rsquo;s board recognized the importance of investment returns. In 1953, they made a groundbreaking change, amending the charter to shift from bank deposits and bonds to primarily stocks and real estate.  This shift in investment philosophy transformed the foundation&rsquo;s fate. Over the next 40 years, despite continued prize payouts and operating costs, the foundation not only recovered all previous losses but also grew its assets to 270 million US dollars by 1993.</p>

<p>Had the Nobel Foundation not changed its approach 40 years ago, clinging to bank savings, it would have vanished, unable to fund the prizes.  Perhaps other wealthy individuals would have established new foundations with larger prizes, replacing the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>The Nobel Foundation&rsquo;s history underscores the importance of financial management.  Even a substantial initial fund, if mismanaged, can be depleted. Conversely, even with significant spending, skillful management can generate rapid growth.</p>
<p>I once heard of a Taiwanese hometown association that established a foundation with 100,000 Taiwan dollars 40 years ago to provide scholarships for children from their hometown.  Forty years later, the fund remains at 100,000 Taiwan dollars. While a significant sum back then, today it barely covers administrative costs, threatening the foundation&rsquo;s existence.  The problem? Neglecting financial management.</p>
<p>Learning from the Nobel Foundation, many US foundations, pension funds, university endowments, and even personal trusts have shifted from bank deposits and bonds to primarily stocks and real estate. In contrast, few Taiwanese foundations grasp this concept, and university endowments rarely address financial management seriously.  The fate of these foundations, if they don&rsquo;t adapt, is clear.</p>
<p>I often participate in corporate training programs, where I habitually ask companies about the size and investment strategy of their employee welfare funds.  The answers are usually similar: small funds, mostly in bank deposits, rarely exceeding a few hundred thousand or a million Taiwan dollars. However, in 1990, during my time at China Development Corporation, the employee welfare fund exceeded 200 million Taiwan dollars. Why?  Because it was primarily invested in China Development Corporation&rsquo;s own stock.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The Nobel Foundation&rsquo;s course correction 40 years ago secured its status today.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Prioritizing security above all else leads to asset depletion.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>The growth and decline of wealth for individuals, families, businesses, or other entities depends on their investment strategy.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Will your hard-earned wealth shrink like the early Nobel fund, or grow like the later one? The key lies in <em>how</em> you invest. If, like many, you keep most of your money in the bank, it&rsquo;s not too late to change. The Nobel Foundation&rsquo;s story shows how a change in investment philosophy can transform everything.  Should you reconsider your financial habits and prioritize investments in stocks and real estate? Let the Nobel Foundation inspire your financial thinking. A single change in mindset can lead to immense wealth decades from now!</p>

</h2>
<p>The people of Taiwan are not only surprised by the enormous wealth of the Lien Chan family, the former chairman of the Kuomintang, but also harbor doubts. How could two generations of civil servants, with their meager salaries, accumulate wealth comparable to that of tycoon families?</p>
<p>This suspicion is deeply ingrained, but the Lien family is a prominent political family in Taiwan, and no one wants to antagonize them by probing too deeply.</p>
<p>As a journalist, the Lien family&rsquo;s wealth has always been a puzzle to me. I even made a determined effort to uncover the truth, but to no avail.  Six months ago, Professor Huang Peiyuan, then director of the Institute of Business Administration at Tunghai University, spoke about his desire to combine theory and practice and publish a &ldquo;Personal Investment Bible.&rdquo; After reading Professor Huang&rsquo;s manuscript, the mystery of the Lien family&rsquo;s wealth became clear to me.  The Lien family is a perfect example of the principles in this &ldquo;Personal Investment Bible.&rdquo; Perhaps Lien Ya-tang, in his early years, wrote not only the renowned &ldquo;General History of Taiwan,&rdquo; but also a &ldquo;Wealth Management Manual&rdquo; passed down only within the family.</p>
<p>According to Professor Huang&rsquo;s (his title at the time; now he is in business) &ldquo;Personal Investment Bible,&rdquo; the first rule is &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep your money in the bank.&rdquo; The second is that if you want to get rich, invest in stocks and real estate.  This gives you the opportunity, with the income of an average office worker, to become a multimillionaire after 40 years of wealth management.</p>
<p>By this standard, the Lien family is indeed the most faithful follower of the &ldquo;Personal Investment Bible.&rdquo; When they had little wealth, Lien&rsquo;s mother (Lien Chan&rsquo;s mother) invested solely in stocks and real estate.  Over the past few decades, the Lien family remained steadfast, waiting for the appreciation of their stocks and real estate, which naturally led to the vast wealth that now arouses public suspicion.</p>
<p>Several decades ago, there were many business people who possessed similar wealth to the Lien family.  These individuals also worked hard to manage their businesses and accumulate more wealth.  However, compared to the Lien family now, most of them lament their inferiority in terms of wealth. The Lien family&rsquo;s role as pure investors fully demonstrates that &ldquo;as long as the concepts and methods are correct, wealth will naturally follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, the theories and methods in the &ldquo;Personal Investment Bible&rdquo; have been discussed by countless scholars and experts in mature Western societies, but not many have truly adhered to them and become millionaires as a result.  The reason lies not in the inadequacy of the theories and methods, but in the lack of confidence and patience of those who apply them, leading them to give up halfway.</p>
<p>Therefore, I advise all readers of this book to truly believe in the theories presented, have long-term patience, and adhere to them unwaveringly in order to succeed.</p>
<p>We wish all readers the ability to enjoy a happy retirement with sufficient financial resources, which is perhaps the greatest contribution of the &ldquo;Personal Investment Bible&rdquo; to the public! (This article is written by the president of Business Weekly Taiwan)</p>

<p>I see many people working tirelessly to make money, hoping to improve their own and their families&rsquo; financial situation, but they can&rsquo;t find the right way. Many people clearly have the conditions to become rich through financial management, but they don&rsquo;t know how to manage their finances, resulting in missed opportunities.  Others know that investment and financial management can lead to wealth, but the problem is that what they know is not true, leading them astray and suffering from financial mismanagement.  The author sees these phenomena and often feels sorry for them.</p>
<p>The biggest problem in Taiwan at present is the serious lack of financial education. The public lacks a correct concept of financial management. They either don&rsquo;t know how to manage their finances and neglect it, or they use the wrong methods. As a result, some people not only fail to achieve wealth through financial management, but even fail to achieve basic financial independence.  Insufficient or incorrect financial concepts are harmful not only to one&rsquo;s own financial situation, but also to the public. This is the main motivation for the author to write this book, and what this book offers readers is the correct basic concept of investment and financial management.</p>
<p>As a scholar and a practitioner of financial management, I feel obligated to share my years of investment research results and practical experience in financial management with everyone, helping the public to easily manage their finances and achieve wealth through investment. The message this book wants to convey is: Financial management is actually very simple. Not only can everyone do it easily, but almost all young people have the conditions to achieve wealth through financial management.</p>
<p>This book is based on 20 years of practical financial management experience in the United States and Taiwan, 6 years of investment research at Tunghai University, and 15 years of experience as a financial advisor.  In fact, the concepts and practices in this book were developed 3 years ago.  For the past 3 years, the author has given lectures on this topic in various places and received tremendous feedback.  Many listeners have continuously requested that I compile these concepts and action guidelines into a book.  I personally also feel that these financial management concepts and action guidelines are indeed beneficial to the public and there is indeed a need to publish a book.</p>
<p>However, putting these concepts into words is a difficult task for me, so I have procrastinated for 3 years. Recently, thanks to the repeated urging of Mr. He, President of Business Weekly Cultural Enterprise, and Ms. Sun Meiqing, and the examples and suggestions provided by Ms. Shen Wenci, and especially the efforts of Mr. Yang Weikai, who spent several months helping me revise and proofread, this book has finally been completed. I express my sincere gratitude here.</p>
<p>If this book can be read by the general public, and if they can accept the concepts and financial management methods described in the book, then all the author&rsquo;s efforts will have been truly worthwhile. Good ideas should be shared with everyone. I hope everyone can benefit from them and easily become millionaires through financial management.</p>
<p>Finally, I dedicate this book to my parents, Mr. Huang Minting and Ms. Huang Juzhi, who raised and nurtured me.</p>

</h2>
<p>In recent years, Taiwan&rsquo;s economy has grown rapidly.  While continuous economic growth is certainly gratifying, the problem of uneven wealth distribution has become increasingly serious. Some blame inappropriate government policies, while others believe it&rsquo;s due to speculation, which has caused stock and housing prices to rise, widening the gap between rich and poor. The author believes that these factors are not the main cause. The real reason for the widening wealth gap is the significant disparity in financial literacy among the public.</p>
<p>Starting in 1986, Taiwan officially entered an era of abundant capital and a focus on wealth management.  The New Taiwan dollar slowly appreciated from 40 to 27 against the US dollar, and during this period, a large amount of foreign exchange flowed into Taiwan, creating a situation where &ldquo;money overflowed in Taiwan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Due to the excess capital, people began to shift their money towards investing in stocks and real estate. The huge influx of funds into the stock and housing markets caused stock and housing prices to soar. Between 1986 and 1989, housing prices increased by an average of two to four times, and the weighted stock market index rose from over 700 points in early 1986 to 12,680 points in February 1990, an increase of 18 times.  Investing in stocks and participating in the capital market is inherently meaningful, and rising stock prices are a natural consequence of economic growth. Unfortunately, most investors adopted the wrong approach, believing that to profit in the stock market, they must buy low and sell high, earning the difference.  In reality, short-term trading is not only time-consuming and laborious but also incurs huge transaction costs, resulting in most investors losing money. The stock market is almost equated with a casino.</p>
<p>The purpose of this book is to enlighten the public&rsquo;s financial mindset by providing new perspectives, concepts, and methods to cope with the important yet complex investment environment. The author sincerely hopes that after reading this book, readers will develop a new financial mentality and adopt correct financial management methods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting rich&rdquo; is almost everyone&rsquo;s desire, and most people think that their monthly income is not much, and the amount they can save is even less. At this rate of wealth accumulation, it seems impossible to get rich. But in fact, with enough time and proper financial management, becoming a millionaire is not impossible.  Wealth accumulation through financial management requires only three basic conditions: regular savings, the pursuit of high returns, and long-term waiting.</p>
<p>The easiest way to achieve wealth through financial management is to learn from those who have done so. What are their methods? The secret of most successful wealth managers is not that they are smarter, harder working, or luckier than others, but that they have the habits and practices of wealth creation.</p>
<p>In the past, family financial management was rarely mentioned in school education.  Perhaps this is because investment and financial management involve money, and most people think that making money with money has a connotation of getting something for nothing.  In formal school education, teachers avoid mentioning it, believing that talking about money in education may corrupt people&rsquo;s minds, especially making money with money, which doesn&rsquo;t seem noble.  However, long-term avoidance of this issue has only exacerbated the problem.</p>
<p>The people of Taiwan, through years of joint efforts, have created an economic miracle and accumulated a large amount of wealth. However, most individuals and families only know how to make money but not how to manage it, let alone how to use it wisely.  After acquiring wealth, individuals, families, and even the entire society have suffered rather than benefited. For example, in recent years, money games have been prevalent.  Many people are busy speculating in stocks and real estate, and various forms of gambling such as the Mark Six lottery, futures, and foreign exchange margin trading are still popular and becoming increasingly rampant.  Many people are obsessed with money games, all for the purpose of making money and improving their family&rsquo;s financial situation.  However, if we calmly review the investment results of the past few years, it is not difficult to find that in the end, few have profited, many have lost, and even more have gone bankrupt.  Everyone has worked in vain, and the result is only a rapid redistribution of wealth and a prevalence of unhealthy speculation in society. The wealth of individuals and society as a whole does not increase. This is all due to the public&rsquo;s lack of clear understanding of financial management concepts.</p>
<p>The consequence of poor financial literacy is not only personal loss and family misfortune but also a waste of overall social resources.  Let&rsquo;s face this issue that is crucial to individuals, families, and the entire society: family financial management.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, &ldquo;When a couple is poor, everything is sad.&rdquo;  This shows that if a family&rsquo;s financial situation cannot meet the needs of family life, or if finances are not managed properly, happiness is hard to come by. Of course, there are many factors that contribute to a happy family, and wealth is only one of them, as many family problems cannot be solved with money. There is a saying: &ldquo;Money is not everything, but without money, you can do nothing.&rdquo; Although money is not the center of a family, in our real society, most good things require money. Wealthy families are not necessarily happy, but families without money are usually even less so. To make ourselves and our families happier, investment and financial management are indeed imperative. Investment and financial management can not only improve the financial situation of an individual or a family, but it is also a good way to accumulate wealth.  Using financial management to achieve wealth is achievable for everyone, and it is something everyone should do.</p>
<p>Future wealth depends on the future investment environment, and the biggest characteristic of the investment environment, in a word, is change.  The entire financial environment is ever-changing and unpredictable. This has been true in the past and will be even more so in the future. In the world of investment and financial management, there is constant change. It can be said that &ldquo;the only constant is change.&rdquo; It is foreseeable that the changes in the next 10 years will exceed those of the previous 50 years. Changes are not only becoming faster, but also more complex, diversified, and international. Whether we like it or not, we are already in a rapidly changing environment.</p>
<p>Facing change, you can remain calm, adapt, and adopt the appropriate mental attitude. However, if you know how change will affect you, you may not dare to take it lightly. Because the natural consequence of any change is redistribution, including wealth, power, markets, personnel&hellip; In terms of wealth, any change in the investment environment will naturally affect the flow of money at all levels.  Indeed, in financial markets, capital markets, commodity markets, spot or futures markets worldwide, billions of dollars are traded every day, and wealth is constantly being redistributed.  Your wealth may increase significantly during the redistribution process, or it may shrink rapidly.  After long-term redistribution, you may become a billionaire, or you may become penniless, depending on how you face and deal with the changes.</p>
<p>Any change and the resulting redistribution poses a &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; to your wealth to a greater or lesser extent. The Chinese characters for &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; are profound and often quoted in foreign books because they contain both danger and opportunity. &ldquo;Wei&rdquo; represents the threat to wealth, and &ldquo;Ji&rdquo; represents the opportunity for wealth creation.</p>
<p>We can wait for changes and redistribution to determine our future wealth level, or we can make good use of the opportunities brought about by change and try to reduce its destructive power.  In this era of accelerating change, cultivating the ability to manage and respond to change is essential to controlling our own future.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, changes in business, economy, finance, politics, society, and other aspects will accelerate. The overall financial environment will become more complex and unpredictable, and it is foreseeable that future wealth redistribution will inevitably accelerate. Therefore, for ourselves, our families, and society, everyone should play the role of a financial manager.</p>
<p>This is an era of rapid change and abundant wealth, and it is also an era that forces us to manage our finances.  Everyone desires to become rich and improve their living standards or achieve their life goals. There are many ways to get rich, but the concept the author wants to elaborate on in this book is: Investment and financial management is one of the effective methods to achieve wealth. As long as you have the correct financial management concepts and put them into practice, whether you are rich or poor now, over time, you may become a millionaire through investment and financial management.</p>
<p>In this critical era related to our future wealth, you can no longer remain indifferent to financial management or ignorant of investment.  You must adopt the correct financial concepts as early as possible, constantly acquire new knowledge, and avoid mistakes in order to win in the process of wealth redistribution.</p>
<p><strong>The Story of the Mailman Who Got Rich</strong></p>
<p>My brother-in-law has a friend in Taichung, a middle-aged man with a dark complexion and an occasional shy smile. My first impression of him wasn&rsquo;t memorable until he drove away in a new BMW. The second time we met, he arrived in a Mercedes-Benz, which made me admire him.  I realized that appearances can be deceiving and quickly asked him what kind of big business he was in. He said he wasn&rsquo;t a businessman, just an ordinary office worker.  I pressed him further, asking which big company he worked for. He said he worked at the post office. I thought he must be a senior executive to be so prestigious and own two luxury cars.  The answer, however, was surprising. He replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a mailman. I deliver mail by motorcycle in the morning, with a monthly salary of NT$30,000-40,000.&rdquo; I secretly speculated that he must specialize in delivering registered mail and was pocketing some of the contents.  He then told me his story. His previous generation were poor farmers who left behind some land, which he had always regarded as ancestral property and kept without selling. No one expected that recent land consolidation would increase the value of his land by dozens of times. Now, just by renting out houses, he earns NT$500,000 in rent every month.  This 48-year-old mailman didn&rsquo;t rely on increasing income and reducing expenditure, but simply by putting his assets in the right place, he now has assets of more than NT$300 million. This is one of the examples of wealth accumulation through financial management in Taiwanese society.</p>
<p>Similar stories seem to happen frequently around us. Before I taught at the university, I worked for an investment company. Once, during the election of directors and supervisors at a shareholders&rsquo; meeting, I discovered that a major shareholder holding more than NT$200 million worth of shares was actually a clerk in the company&rsquo;s personnel department.  It turned out that 35 years ago, when she joined the company as an employee, her salary was very low and her life was insecure, so she saved her meager salary. When company employees had fractional shares to transfer, she would buy them. After many years, this woman in her 50s, although unremarkable and not looking like a rich woman, now has a net worth of more than NT$200 million, enough to enjoy her retirement. In fact, there are countless examples of such ordinary office workers who have become wealthy through investment and financial management. Many people say that office workers cannot become rich, but in reality, wealthy office workers mostly don&rsquo;t like to show off, so the way to get rich through investment and financial management is often overlooked.</p>
<p><strong>What Differentiates the Rich from the Poor?</strong></p>
<p>Many hardworking office workers who toil daily for money have had the common experience of watching rich people in expensive clothes, living in luxurious villas, and driving by in luxury cars, looking impressive and enviable. While admiring them, you may have wondered: &ldquo;What makes them rich, but not me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many people attribute the wealth of these rich people directly to their being born rich, their successful entrepreneurial ventures, their being smarter, harder working, or luckier than others. However, family background, entrepreneurship, intelligence, hard work, and luck cannot explain all the reasons for wealth accumulation. We have all encountered many rich people, such as &ldquo;nouveau riche&rdquo; or &ldquo;landowners.&rdquo; They were not born into wealthy families, nor are they businessmen. They are not necessarily very smart, haven&rsquo;t received much higher education, and are not more frugal than us. Some of them even idle around all day. The only thing they seem to be better at than you is that they are rich.</p>
<p>What special skills do these rich people possess that are lacking in those office workers who diligently save money and work hard every day? How can they accumulate such enormous wealth in their lifetime? This is the question the author has been eager to explore for many years.  I have tried to explain their wealth with factors such as family background, entrepreneurship, occupation, education, IQ, and effort, but all seem to have failed. After years of observation, induction, and academic research, I have discovered a very important factor that is often overlooked by most people: the ability to invest and manage finances. At the same time, I have also discovered the following three facts:</p>
<p><em>1. One of the important factors that distinguishes the rich from the poor is: the ability to invest and manage finances.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Everyone can achieve wealth through investment and financial management.</em></p>
<p><em>3. The first thing to do to improve your financial situation is: to understand the basic concepts of investment and financial management.</em>

Using the wealth comparison between Koo Chen-fu and Koo Li-hsiung, the financial management methods of the Lien Chan family, and an example of becoming a billionaire by investing $1,200 monthly for 40 years, the article illustrates the importance of investment and emphasizes the power of compound interest. Furthermore, it analyzes the impact of financial habits on the wealth gap and how to educate the next generation to establish a correct concept of financial management, suggesting incorporating ‚ÄúDon&amp;#39;t keep money in the bank‚Äù into family precepts to cultivate investment awareness from an early age.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

</h3>
<p>The Chinatrust Financial Holding Co., one of the top five conglomerates in Taiwan, was led by Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Koo&rsquo;s Group, and Jeffrey Koo, chairman of Chinatrust Commercial Bank. The Koo&rsquo;s Group encompassed seven major business segments: finance, manufacturing, construction, hotels, media, services, and overseas operations, with over 50 affiliated companies and total assets exceeding NT$460 billion. Many wondered how this uncle-nephew duo achieved both political and business success, and who was wealthier.</p>
<p><strong>The Wealth Race Between Koo Chen-fu and Jeffrey Koo</strong></p>
<p>Wealth often correlates with personality. Koo Chen-fu was a slow and steady type, while Jeffrey Koo was more of a go-getter.  Due to their vastly different personalities, their investment approaches also differed significantly.  Koo Chen-fu&rsquo;s eldest son, Eugene Koo, the general manager of China Life Insurance in Taiwan, understood them well. He once said, &ldquo;Money put in Koo Chen-fu&rsquo;s pocket would never come out, but money put in Jeffrey Koo&rsquo;s pocket would disappear.&rdquo;  This was because Jeffrey Koo continuously reinvested his money, leading to greater wealth accumulation than his uncle. Jeffrey Koo&rsquo;s personal assets were spread across the US and Japan, invested in real estate, funds, hotels, golf courses, and banks.  Koo Chen-fu, in his 80s, was quite conservative. Regarding his financial management philosophy, he said, &ldquo;I neglect financial management and don&rsquo;t want to worry about money.&rdquo;  His personal income was deposited in the bank by his secretary, and aside from necessary expenses, the rest was converted into fixed-term deposits.</p>
<p>Over the years, Koo Chen-fu naturally had more cash on hand, as his money remained in the bank. However, in terms of wealth creation, Jeffrey Koo far surpassed him. Despite a 17-year age difference, with proper investment, one could still come out ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Investing $1,200 Monthly Can Make You a Billionaire in 40 Years</strong></p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s not what you don&rsquo;t know that gets you into trouble. It&rsquo;s what you know for sure that just ain&rsquo;t so.</em></p>
<p>The first concept to understand about investment is: <strong>Investment not only improves financial situations but also allows anyone to achieve wealth.</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s illustrate with a simple example:</p>
<p>Suppose a young person with no savings starts saving NT$14,000 annually for 40 years.  If this money is invested in stocks or real estate with an average annual return of 20%, how much wealth will they accumulate after 40 years?</p>
<p>The author often asks this question in lectures. Most guesses range from NT$2 million to NT$8 million, with a maximum of NT$10 million. The correct answer, however, is a surprising NT$102.81 million!  For a 25-year-old, saving NT$14,000 annually (equivalent to $1,200 monthly) for 40 years, with a total investment of NT$560,000, could result in becoming a billionaire by age 65, assuming a 20% annual return in stocks or real estate.</p>
<p>This figure is calculated using the future value of an annuity formula in finance and investment. The calculation is as follows:</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mn>1.4</mn><mo>√ó</mo><mfrac><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0.20</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>40</mn></mrow></msup><mo>‚àí</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mn>0.20</mn></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>10281</mn><mspace linebreak="newline"></mspace></math>
(Units are in NT$10,000)</p>
<p>This formula illustrates how small amounts of money can grow significantly through investment.  Understanding the formula isn&rsquo;t crucial; most people who become billionaires through investment don&rsquo;t know it, and knowing it doesn&rsquo;t guarantee success.</p>
<p>Therefore, with youth, ambition, investment knowledge, and three key factors‚Äîsaving NT$14,000 annually, investing in stocks or real estate, and patiently waiting for 40 years‚Äîanyone can achieve wealth through investment, regardless of their current economic situation.  These three factors are attainable for everyone:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Saving NT$14,000 annually (NT$1,200 monthly) should be manageable for most. (If you can&rsquo;t save this much, focus on saving before investing. This book may not be as helpful yet, as you need some capital to start investing.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Historically, the long-term average return on stocks and real estate has been above 20%.  Consistently investing in these assets and holding them long-term can yield a 20% average return. These investment tools are accessible to everyone. (Data shows that the Taiwan stock market has averaged around 20% annual returns over the past 20 years; studies show similar returns for Taiwan real estate over the past 40 years.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>40 years seems long, but it&rsquo;s a timeframe most people have.  Starting work between 20 and 25 and retiring at 65 provides a 40-year investment window.  While some are born rich and others poor, most have a fair chance at accumulating wealth over 40 years.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This example shows that investment not only improves finances but also provides a path to wealth.  With the right concepts and practices, anyone can achieve wealth through investment.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Investing Can Shorten the Journey by 10 Years</strong></p>
<p>While the initial example uses 40 years to demonstrate the power of investing, most readers are likely in a better position. They may already have savings and can save more than NT$14,000 annually, shortening their path to wealth.</p>
<p>The table below illustrates the wealth accumulation over 10-year intervals using the previous example (investing NT$14,000 annually with a 20% return):</p>
<p>If you have NT$360,000, congratulations! You&rsquo;ve saved 10 years of effort. By continuing to invest in stocks or real estate, you could become a billionaire in 30 years. With NT$2.61 million, you&rsquo;ve saved 20 years. With NT$16.55 million, you&rsquo;re even closer, needing only 10 more years.</p>

<p>Most readers likely have some savings, allowing them to achieve significant wealth in 20-30 years.</p>
<p><strong>Investing Doesn&rsquo;t Require Advanced Knowledge</strong></p>
<p><em>The trouble with the world is not that people know too little, but that they know so many things that just aren&rsquo;t so.</em></p>
<p>Many believe investing requires perfect timing and extensive financial knowledge.  This isn&rsquo;t entirely true.  After years of studying investment, and witnessing ordinary people achieve wealth through it, I can confidently say that investment success doesn&rsquo;t depend on academic qualifications, intelligence, technical skills, or predictive abilities.  It depends on doing the right things. Successful investors aren&rsquo;t necessarily highly educated or technically skilled; they can be ordinary people who understand fundamental principles.</p>
<p>By doing the right things, anyone can achieve wealth through investment, regardless of their background or effort. Investing doesn&rsquo;t require genius or specialized knowledge; common sense and consistent action are key. Investors don&rsquo;t need to rely on experts; with the right mindset, you can outperform them.</p>
<p>Investing isn&rsquo;t about complex techniques; it&rsquo;s about having the right mindset.  Successful investors simply cultivate habits that most people find uncomfortable or difficult to maintain. Do you understand that investing can create wealth? If so, are you actively pursuing it?</p>
<p>From another perspective, investing can be challenging. The difficulty lies not in needing advanced knowledge, but in going against ingrained habits. This is difficult for most people.</p>
<p>This book presents seemingly simple investment concepts, but wealth is built through consistent, correct habits. Start your investment journey by building the right habits!</p>

<p>The amount of money you accumulate in your lifetime depends not on how much you earn, but on how you manage it.</p>

<p>A Taiwanese proverb says, &ldquo;People have two legs, money has four.&rdquo; Money chases money faster than people chase money.</p>
<p>Traditional wisdom dictates that &ldquo;the path to wealth lies in diligence and frugality.&rdquo;  This held true in times of economic stagnation, but in today&rsquo;s rapidly changing economy, this mindset requires adjustment.</p>
<p>A century ago, before modern economics became widespread, during periods of economic stagnation and frequent wars, saving was indeed crucial for wealth accumulation. Today, however, with global economic growth and soaring stock and real estate prices, the focus should shift from saving to leveraging the power of compound interest for exponential growth.</p>
<p><strong>How Did Lien Chan Become Wealthy?</strong></p>
<p><em>With so many assets, it&rsquo;s impossible to monitor everything closely. During the period of entrusted management, the principle was to hold existing investments and not trade stocks or dispose of real estate.</em></p>
<p>Lien Chan, with an estimated net worth of nearly NT$6 billion, was one of Taiwan&rsquo;s wealthiest officials. His wealth wasn&rsquo;t accumulated through decades of frugal living on a government salary or through earning a doctoral degree.  It stemmed from his mother&rsquo;s shift in investment strategy over 40 years prior.</p>
<p>Around 1951, Chang Pin-san, former chairman of Chang Hwa Bank, advised Lien Chan&rsquo;s father, Lien Chen-tung, to invest in shares of the &ldquo;Big Three&rdquo; commercial banks.  Following this advice, Lien Chan&rsquo;s mother, Chao Lan-kun, invested her savings in hundreds of shares of Chang Hwa Bank, holding them long-term and letting their value appreciate naturally. This laid the foundation for the Lien family&rsquo;s fortune. Chao Lan-kun had a keen financial mind. Unlike other women who participated in rotating savings and credit associations or simply deposited money in banks, she actively invested.  She sold ancestral farmland in Miaoli and co-developed a property on Nanjing West Road with Huang Lie-huo, founder of Wei Chuan Foods Corporation, splitting the profits. This prime real estate became a significant source of wealth for the Lien family.</p>
<p>Stocks, real estate, and land were the Lien family&rsquo;s wealth-generating tools. Over the years, Lien Chan accumulated holdings in 19 different stocks, including Chang Hwa Bank, Taipei Business Bank, Hua Nan Bank, and Cathay Life Insurance.  His real estate holdings were located in prime areas like the Da&rsquo;an, Shilin, and Zhongshan districts, including 11 plots of land and 26 properties.</p>
<p>Lien Chan once described his family&rsquo;s investment approach as &ldquo;Wu Wei Er Zhi&rdquo; (doing nothing and achieving everything), meaning buying and holding long-term.  By investing in stocks and real estate 40 years ago and patiently holding them, with minimal trading and benefiting from annual returns exceeding 20%, they amassed a fortune nearing NT$10 billion.</p>
<p>You might argue that the Lien family was already wealthy 40 years ago. This might be true, but the point is that while they were prominent, many families in Taiwan were wealthier back then. Today, very few families surpass the Liens in wealth.  This is attributed to their early adoption of the correct investment strategy ‚Äì focusing on stocks and real estate.</p>
<p><strong>The Key to Wealth Lies in Financial Management, Not Just Saving</strong></p>
<p><em>The ability to earn money is less important than having a mind for financial management, understanding how to make money work for you.</em></p>
<p>Chinese culture values diligence and frugality.  Older generations often teach younger ones that the path to wealth lies in these principles and careful budgeting.  The saying &ldquo;Great wealth comes from heaven, small wealth from frugality&rdquo; encourages thriftiness, as it&rsquo;s seen as the key to wealth.  This emphasis on saving is reflected in Taiwan&rsquo;s high savings rate.  However, I want to convey a crucial message: while saving is important, financial management is even more so.</p>
<p>In the previous example, how much of the NT$100+ million fortune came from diligence and frugality? The answer is NT$560,000, accumulated by saving NT$14,000 annually for 40 years.  This represents only 0.5% of the total.  The remaining 99.5% came from investment, specifically the power of compound interest at a 20% annual return over 40 years.  Which is more important, saving or investing? <strong>Therefore, lifetime wealth accumulation depends not on how much you earn, but on how you manage your money.</strong></p>
<p>If a worker realizes in old age that their wealth primarily comes from a lifetime of hard work and saving, it&rsquo;s almost certain they won&rsquo;t be very wealthy.  The key to wealth through investment isn&rsquo;t the ability to &ldquo;earn and save,&rdquo; but the ability to leverage the &ldquo;compounding power of money.&rdquo;  For most, improving their financial situation requires focusing on investment, not just saving.</p>
<p>Consider this: saving NT$1 million annually without investing would take 100 years to reach NT$100 million. In contrast, investing NT$14,000 annually could make you a billionaire in 40 years. If Chao Lan-kun had only focused on saving and not investing, would the Lien family be as wealthy as they are today?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not dismissing the importance of saving, but I want to emphasize that it shouldn&rsquo;t overshadow investment. Investment plays a crucial role in wealth accumulation.  For successful investors, wealth comes primarily from &ldquo;making money work for you,&rdquo; not from earning or saving. Therefore, in addition to being diligent and frugal, learn how to invest.</p>
<p>To improve your financial situation, remember: earning is important, but managing your money is more so. <strong>A correct investment mindset and wise investment choices have a greater impact on your future financial status than your current wealth or future income.</strong> For most, the first step towards improving their finances is not to increase saving, but to understand the correct investment concepts and take action.</p>
<p><em>1. For those who achieve wealth through investment, their fortune comes primarily from making money work for them, not from earning or saving.</em></p>
<p><em>2.  Less than 1% of a NT$100 million fortune comes directly from earned income.</em></p>
<p><em>3.  Investment is not a technique, but a mindset.</em></p>
<p><em>4. The key to financial management is having money to manage, not the amount of money.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who learn to invest are like having a money-printing machine.</p>

<p>A study indicates that in recent years, the public has perceived a serious wealth gap in Taiwan, with a trend towards wealth polarization. Over 47% of respondents believe that &ldquo;speculation in stocks or real estate&rdquo; is the main cause of this widening gap, followed by &ldquo;personal work ability and effort&rdquo; (14%) and &ldquo;family background&rdquo; (11%).  This suggests a common belief that the wealth gap isn&rsquo;t solely due to individual effort, but also to systemic issues, luck, and unequal opportunities.</p>
<p>Indeed, &ldquo;stocks and real estate&rdquo; are major contributors to the wealth gap, while &ldquo;personal work ability and effort&rdquo; and &ldquo;family background&rdquo; have less impact. <strong>People often attribute their poverty to external factors like systemic issues, luck, or lack of opportunity, or use negative terms like &ldquo;speculation&rdquo; to explain their lack of action.</strong> Wealthy individuals often accumulate their wealth through real estate or stock investments, not primarily through &ldquo;speculation,&rdquo; but through &ldquo;holding appropriate investment assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the wealth gap will likely continue to widen. Some will benefit, while others will suffer, depending on their ability to navigate the changing landscape. External factors alone don&rsquo;t determine our financial situation; our investment abilities play a crucial role.</p>
<p><em>1. Financial habits create the difference between the rich and the poor.</em></p>
<p><em>2. The prerequisite for building wealth through investment is allocating assets to high-return investments like stocks or real estate.</em></p>
<p><em>3. One way for the government to address the widening wealth gap is to educate the public about proper financial management.</em></p>
<p><strong>Greater Investment, Greater Returns</strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Thoughts change actions, actions change habits, habits change character, and character changes destiny.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Imagine two classmates who join the same company after graduation, holding similar positions with the same salary.  Both are equally frugal, saving NT$14,000 annually for investment. The difference lies in their approach: one keeps their savings in the bank, while the other invests in stocks. Both largely leave their money untouched after depositing or investing it.</p>
<p>After 40 years, the stock investor becomes a billionaire, while the bank saver becomes a &ldquo;millionaire.&rdquo;  While a billion represents significant wealth, &ldquo;millionaire&rdquo; now evokes laughter, being synonymous with &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; in Taiwan&rsquo;s expensive housing market.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;millionaire&rdquo; classmate, seeing their former colleague with the same starting conditions become a billionaire, might assume foul play or lottery winnings. How could their wealth differ so drastically, with one rich and the other struggling?</p>
<p>Those with less wealth often attribute the success of the wealthy to luck or illicit activities. A more positive view might be that they worked harder or were more frugal.  However, they often overlook the critical factor: financial habits. The rich and poor manage their money differently: the rich hold assets like real estate and stocks, while the poor keep their money in the bank.</p>
<p>To become wealthy through investment, one must break free from conventional thinking. An adult who couldn&rsquo;t ride a bicycle saw a child doing so and complained, &ldquo;Only agile children can ride bikes.&rdquo; The child responded, &ldquo;Agility isn&rsquo;t necessary,&rdquo; and taught the adult to ride.  The adult quickly learned but, upon parting ways, instinctively pushed the bicycle home instead of riding it.  This illustrates the difficulty of breaking free from ingrained habits.</p>
<p>If financial management is the primary cause of the wealth gap, the solution lies in improving financial literacy and encouraging people to learn more about investing.</p>
<p><strong>Focusing Solely on Saving is Outdated</strong></p>
<p><em>If one adheres to the principles of investment, it&rsquo;s hard not to become wealthy. If one doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s hard to become wealthy.</em></p>
<p>I often wonder why, after over 200 years since their ancestors arrived in Taiwan with nothing, most Taiwanese families aren&rsquo;t significantly wealthy. Perhaps the problem lies in outdated family precepts that hinder wealth accumulation.</p>
<p>Family precepts are the guiding principles passed down through generations.  Most families emphasize diligence, frugality, and academic excellence, believing these are the keys to success and wealth.</p>
<p>Many families diligently follow these precepts, raising children who are both frugal and well-educated.  However, few families achieve significant wealth through these alone.  These precepts focus on earning money, not on managing it.  To build generational wealth, families need to update their guiding principles.  While &ldquo;diligence and frugality&rdquo; and &ldquo;academic excellence&rdquo; remain valuable, add another: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep money in the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why retain &ldquo;diligence and frugality&rdquo;? While saving alone won&rsquo;t lead to great wealth, it&rsquo;s a virtue and a necessary foundation for investment.</p>
<p><strong>Educating the Next Generation Requires a Balanced Approach</strong></p>
<p>Why keep &ldquo;academic excellence&rdquo;?  Studies show a weak correlation between education and wealth.  Academic success doesn&rsquo;t guarantee financial success.  Based on this, I once stopped emphasizing academics with my children, resulting in declining grades.  Their teacher, puzzled, asked, &ldquo;You and your wife are both highly educated, why don&rsquo;t your children share this trait?&rdquo; I was ashamed.</p>
<p>I immediately reinstated the emphasis on academics. I realized it was partly for our own pride, but also because education can enhance social standing and job security. So, for both parents and children, academic pursuits remain important.</p>
<p>However, for future generations to prosper, add another precept: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep money in the bank!&rdquo;  Encourage children to invest in assets like stocks and real estate, rather than leaving money in low-interest bank accounts.  Otherwise, building significant wealth might take generations.</p>
<p>Every Lunar New Year, I buy stocks for my children instead of giving cash. My second-grader is already learning the importance of investing over saving. This concept should be ingrained early as part of family values, fostering a healthy financial mindset from a young age.</p>
<p>In conclusion, most family precepts are outdated.  Building wealth for future generations requires new concepts and practices.  By updating family values and changing how we accumulate wealth, families can achieve lasting prosperity.</p>
<p><em>1. Diligence, frugality, and academic excellence alone are not enough for building lasting wealth.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Teach children not to keep money in the bank, cultivating a proper investment mindset from a young age.</em></p>
<p><em>3.  Leaving money to children might sustain them for a few years; teaching them how to manage it can provide for a lifetime and for generations to come.</em></p>

<li><strong>Defensive and Enterprising Investors:</strong> Based on risk tolerance and investment objectives, investors are classified as either defensive or enterprising, each employing different investment strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Investors and the Market:</strong> Investors should view market fluctuations rationally, seeing them as opportunities rather than sources of risk.</li>
<li><strong>Company Owner Mentality:</strong> Investors should adopt the mindset of a company owner, paying attention to corporate management and governance and safeguarding their own interests.</li>

<li><strong>Market Fluctuations as a Guide for Investment Decisions:</strong> Investors can capitalize on market volatility to create opportunities for buying low and selling high, but should avoid excessive focus on short-term market trends.</li>
<li><strong>Market Fluctuations of Individual Stocks:</strong> Focusing on undervalued individual stocks is more meaningful than attempting to predict overall market movements.</li>

<li><strong>Foreign Government Bonds:</strong>  Higher risk and difficulty in enforcing claims in case of default.</li>
<li><strong>New Issues:</strong> Require careful evaluation and avoidance of excessive hype surrounding them.</li>
<li><strong>Convertible Issues:</strong> Their advantages often come at the expense of quality or income, and they present investors with decision-making dilemmas.</li>
<li><strong>New-Issue Mania</strong>: During bull markets, many smaller companies go public, and their stock pricing is often unattractive or even excessive. Investors should be wary of the hype surrounding new issues and avoid blindly following the crowd.</li>

<li><strong>Investing in Large Companies during Unpopular Periods:</strong> When large companies are experiencing unpopular periods, their stock prices may be undervalued, presenting opportunities for investors.</li>
<li><strong>Bargain Issues:</strong> Seek securities whose intrinsic value is demonstrably understated and buy them at prices significantly below this value.</li>
<li><strong>Special Situations:</strong>  Focus on events like mergers, reorganizations, and liquidations where the price fluctuations can offer substantial profit opportunities.</li>

<p>This chapter introduces methods for enterprising investors to select securities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Valuation Approach:</strong>  Estimate a company&rsquo;s future earnings and select a suitable multiplier to determine its intrinsic value.</li>
<li><strong>Factors Affecting Asset Value:</strong> Pay attention to net tangible asset value, especially net current asset value. Add half the excess of net current asset value over earnings power value to the earnings power value for a more comprehensive assessment.</li>
<li><strong>Growth Stock Valuation:</strong> Consider the expected growth rate, but be cautious in assessing its reasonableness. The author provides a simplified formula for growth stock valuation: Value = Current (normal) earnings x (8.5 + 2 x expected annual growth rate).</li>
<li><strong>First-Grade vs. Second-Grade Common Stocks:</strong> Enterprising investors can consider buying second-grade common stocks, but only at bargain prices, namely when their price is less than two-thirds of the indicated intrinsic value.</li>

<p>This chapter uses six real-world cases to illustrate how to apply security analysis techniques to uncover undervalued investment opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case 1:  Northern Pacific Railroad common stock (1947):</strong>  The company&rsquo;s stock price was undervalued due to a combination of a low dividend payout and the non-inclusion of certain earnings in its income statement.</li>
<li><strong>Case 2:  Standard Gas and Electric (SP&amp;L) $7 preferred (1947):</strong> Analyzed the complex capital structure of SP&amp;L, pointing out the undervaluation of its preferred stock.</li>
<li><strong>Case 3:  American-Hawaiian Steamship (AHS) (1947):</strong> The company held substantial cash assets that were not reflected in its market price.</li>
<li><strong>Case 4: Royal Dutch Petroleum (RDP) (1953):</strong>  Pointed out that the market value of RDP was undervalued relative to its earnings power.</li>
<li><strong>Case 5:  Hoover Company Class A (1957):</strong> The company&rsquo;s stock was undervalued because the net worth of its British subsidiary was not fully reflected.</li>
<li><strong>Case 6:  Chicago, Terre Haute &amp; Southeastern Railway (TH) bonds (1964):</strong> Analyzed the value of TH bonds, indicating their undervaluation compared to comparable bonds.</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<p>This chapter analyzes the patterns of earnings and price fluctuations for different types of stocks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pattern 1:  Relatively Stable Earnings, Wide Price Fluctuations:</strong> Using S.H. Kress as an example, the chapter demonstrates how even with stable earnings, market prices can fluctuate greatly, primarily driven by market sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern 2:  Earnings Fluctuate Moderately, Stock Prices Fluctuate Widely:</strong> Using General Motors as an example, it illustrates how stock price volatility often exceeds earnings volatility and advises investors to view such fluctuations rationally.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern 3:  Extreme Ups and Downs:</strong>  Taking examples like Brunswick Corporation and St. Louis Southwestern Railway, the chapter highlights the substantial uncertainties in company development and stock price movements. Investors should be wary of companies experiencing extreme volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern 4:  Growth Stocks:</strong> Using examples like 3M and Philip Morris, the chapter shows that even growth stocks face risks, and investors should carefully evaluate their growth potential and avoid overpaying for lofty expectations.</li>

<p>This chapter uses comparative analysis of various stock portfolios to further investigate factors impacting stock prices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Four Groups of Randomly Selected Cases and the Dow Jones Industrial Average</strong>:  By contrasting the performance of stocks in different market standings and comparing their initial trading dates, the chapter suggests that choosing large, strong companies often yields more consistent results. New stocks of smaller companies carry higher risk.</li>
<li><strong>Secular Changes in the Quality of a Company Group</strong>:  Taking railroad stocks as an example, the chapter highlights how the standing and investment merit of companies within a group can shift significantly over time.</li>
<li><strong>The Results of a Policy of Quality Improvement:</strong>  Using the Dow Jones Industrial Average as an example, the chapter illustrates that merely replacing underperforming components with more popular ones does not necessarily lead to sustained investment gains. Stock selection should be based on a combination of company quality and price.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Management Efficiency:</strong>
<ul>
<li>How to assess Management efficiency: By comparing key indicators like profitability, sales margin, and return on net worth to  industry averages.</li>

</h3>
<p>This chapter summarizes the core concept of the book - the Margin of Safety:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition of Margin of Safety:</strong>  Purchasing securities at a price significantly below their intrinsic value, thereby mitigating risk and enhancing potential returns.</li>
<li><strong>Application in Different Investment Types:</strong> Bonds, common stocks, growth stocks, bargain issues, and other asset classes.</li>
<li><strong>Margin of Safety and Diversification:</strong> Diversification can reduce the overall risk of a portfolio and therefore enhances the margin of safety.</li>
<li><strong>Distinguishing Investment from Speculation:</strong>  The margin of safety is a key criterion for differentiating investment operations from speculative ones. Investment operations should be based on a clear and demonstrably justifiable analysis of value, while speculative operations rely more heavily on subjective judgment and market sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>Generalization of the Investment Concept:</strong> The idea of margin of safety can be applied to broader investment domains, such as when purchasing real estate, art, or other assets.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In Wall Street, if you&rsquo;re always doing what&rsquo;s obvious or what everyone else is doing, you&rsquo;re not going to make money.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This emphasizes that to achieve above-average returns, investors require independent thinking and must seek value that is overlooked by the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For rational investment, mental attitude is more important than technique.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis:  Investment success necessitates not just skills and tools, but also the right investment philosophy and mindset, including rationality, patience, and discipline.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t buy after a stock has surged and don&rsquo;t sell after it has plummeted.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: Avoid chasing rising prices and panicking during market dips. Focus on rational valuation and don&rsquo;t be swayed by market emotions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Have the courage of your knowledge and experience. If you have formed a conclusion from the facts and if you know your judgment is sound, act on it‚Äîeven though others may hesitate or differ.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: Investment requires independent judgment. Investors need to be confident and courageous in their convictions, even when facing dissenting opinions. Stay true to your well-researched investment principles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis:  The business landscape is dynamic. Company strength and investment merit can shift over time, requiring investors to maintain a dynamic outlook and avoid fixed biases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Margin of Safety&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis:  This succinct phrase encapsulates the core of Graham&rsquo;s approach. Investing should be grounded in acquiring assets at a price that provides a buffer against uncertainty and potential errors in judgment.</p>

<p>This session revolves around investment and life planning. The core ideas are: be optimistic about investment and keep learning, ignoring short-term market fluctuations; young people should focus on asset appreciation, with Nasdaq 100 index funds being the top choice; utilize leverage and allocate assets reasonably; retirees should plan carefully and avoid excessive debt; and one should stay optimistic and confident, avoid material comparisons, and pursue true freedom.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market Fluctuations and Investment Mentality:</strong> The market is always fluctuating. Don&rsquo;t let short-term fluctuations affect your investment decisions. Stay optimistic.</li>
<li><strong>Currency Devaluation and Asset Appreciation:</strong> Money depreciates; only assets like stocks can preserve and increase in value. Currency devaluation is more severe in emerging countries, so it is advised to convert currency into assets. Taiwan&rsquo;s low wages and currency devaluation are related to the government&rsquo;s subsidy policies.</li>
<li><strong>Worker Mindset vs. Capitalist Mindset:</strong> Workers exchange labor for depreciating currency, while capitalists exchange currency for appreciating assets. Learn to invest and become a capitalist, exchanging &ldquo;trash&rdquo; (depreciating currency) for assets.</li>
<li><strong>Global Market Linkage:</strong> Global markets are highly interconnected, and diversifying investments into other regions has limited effectiveness. Focusing on the US stock market is recommended.</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nasdaq 100 Index Funds:</strong> The preferred choice for young people. Long-term investment can yield substantial returns.  Global codes for purchasing Nasdaq 100 index funds were provided, and investing based on market conditions is recommended.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Cash:</strong> Cash reserves are crucial. 00864B and money market funds (like SWVXX, VOXX) are safeguards and should not be replaced with high-dividend products like SPHD, as principal safety is paramount.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Rebalancing:</strong> Suitable for those who use leveraged funds, are not retired, and have income.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Real Estate Investment:</strong> Housing prices in the Bay Area are high, putting great pressure on young people to buy houses, which can easily lead to financial difficulties. Renting is recommended to maintain flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing and Investment:</strong> Loans, mortgages, and car loans should be repaid with stable cash flow, not relying on stock market returns.</li>
<li><strong>Retirement Planning:</strong> Retirees should be cautious about borrowing and make plans based on the size of their retirement funds.  If retirement funds are 50 times the annual expenses, two options are available: 1. Keep the mortgage and car loan, using 2% of the retirement fund annually to cover all expenses; 2. Pay off the mortgage and car loan, invest 80% of the remaining funds in 00662, 20% in 00864B, and use 2% of the total funds annually for living expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation Case Study:</strong> A case study with 45 million Taiwan dollars illustrated asset allocation strategies when withdrawals are not needed. An 80/20 allocation or a combination of leveraged funds (60% 00662, 20% 00670L, 20% 00864B) is recommended.  For those with stable income and no need to withdraw from investments, 100% investment in QQQ can be considered.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: Read &ldquo;Investing is Asset Allocation, What You Don&rsquo;t Know,&rdquo; agreeing with the importance of accumulating the first pot of gold early; learning investment allows for more focus on work and personal improvement, spending time each day learning new skills and increasing self-worth.  Investment enables people to be more motivated to improve their professional skills rather than &ldquo;lying flat.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Individuals can improve their earning potential through learning, even if their investment assets are reduced to zero, they can still rely on professional skills to make a comeback.</li>
<li>Question 1: What should I do if the Beta value is very low when the asset value plummets in the Excel sheet?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: The sheet is designed for acceleration during market rises and deceleration during falls. A low Beta value is normal and a reflection of risk control; no adjustment is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Even knowing that investment should be mindless, I still worry when the Beta value drops. How should I cope?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Deceleration during declines is the purpose of the investment strategy. Don&rsquo;t worry, stick to the plan, just like autopilot.</li>

In the long run, the returns can be substantial, but psychological barriers must be overcome.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Rise faster, fall slower.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of James&rsquo;s core investment philosophies. Through smart rebalancing strategies, increase investment during market rises to accelerate profits, and reduce investment during market downturns to mitigate losses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Money is the least valuable thing when it has no value.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reflects James&rsquo;s unique view on wealth. When wealth accumulates to a certain extent, the value of money itself is no longer important; what matters more is pursuing freedom and happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want freedom, and you want privacy, you will not have freedom. In the future world, if you want privacy, you will not have freedom.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows James&rsquo;s insight into future social trends. In the high-tech era, one needs to make trade-offs between privacy and freedom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more daring one is to borrow money, the broader their perspective.
&ndash; YJ Yuanlin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>YJ Yuanlin&rsquo;s sharing led to James&rsquo;s views on borrowing: good debt can help wealth growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want freedom, you cannot care.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Echoing the topic of Elon Musk supporting Trump and the entrepreneurial spirit, true freedom is not caring about external opinions and focusing on one&rsquo;s goals.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t use ChatGPT now, you are outdated and will be eliminated.

<li><strong>Market Trends and Investment Philosophy:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Drives the Future:</strong> AI demand is not a bubble, but a genuine driving force behind technological advancement, promising a bull market spanning two decades.  We are currently in the early stages of this growth.  Morris Chang (TSMC Chairman)&rsquo;s perspective and TSMC&rsquo;s investments in AI corroborate this judgment. The long bull market has begun, seize the opportunity to join the wealth train.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility and Long-Term Investment:</strong> Market fluctuations are inherent to investing.  Downswings are followed by even greater upswings. Using historical data from the Taiwan Weighted Index, Nikkei Index, and the US stock market as examples, the session illustrates the long-term market development pattern: an initial period of rapid growth followed by a period of stagnation (e.g., 32 years in Taiwan, 35 years in Japan, 24 years in the US), before entering a phase of stable growth.  Therefore, overcoming panic caused by market volatility and adhering to a long-term investment strategy is crucial for ultimate success.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalism and Investment:</strong>  The side effects of capitalism are wealth disparity and the exploitation of labor. Learn to operate like a capitalist and profit from investment.  Hard work and saving money to buy government bonds will ultimately result in wealth erosion due to inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits of Quantitative Easing:</strong> Quantitative easing is beneficial for investors, fostering a low-interest-rate environment and driving asset price appreciation.  Those who fail to understand quantitative easing and complain about government money printing are often victims of capitalism, missing out on the benefits of asset appreciation.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics of a Mature Market:</strong> Mature markets are characterized by fair, just, and transparent regulatory mechanisms, companies focused on their core businesses, and a high proportion of long-term investors and institutional holdings. The Taiwanese market is gradually maturing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Investment Strategies and Recommendations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invest in Nasdaq 100:</strong>  The session recommends investing in Nasdaq 100 index funds (QQQ), with the option to allocate to S&amp;P 500 or high-dividend ETFs based on individual circumstances.  References to Nasdaq 100 index funds globally are provided for the convenience of investors worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Penny Stocks:</strong>  Refrain from investing in penny stocks, as they generally offer low long-term returns.  Real investment opportunities lie in companies that demonstrate sustained growth and lead technological advancements.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of Stock Pledging:</strong> Stock pledging offers advantages over real estate mortgages, as stocks, unlike real estate, do not depreciate and can be held long-term, potentially allowing for &ldquo;borrowing without repayment or interest&rdquo; (specific instructions are available in related videos).</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Flawed Rebalancing Strategies:</strong> Avoid a 50% principal + 50% leveraged ETF rebalancing strategy, as it carries high risk and can easily deplete cash reserves during market downturns.</li>
<li><strong>Estate Planning and Stock Pledging:</strong> When engaging in stock pledging, it is advisable to diversify assets across multiple brokerage firms, pledging a portion and keeping the rest as cash to facilitate estate handling for inheritors.  Cat supplemented this with a detailed explanation of the stock pledging inheritance process, emphasizing the importance of advance planning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Other Important Matters:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Warning and Disclaimer:</strong>  The content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.  Do not remit funds to unknown accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Program Format Adjustment:</strong>  The presentation content will be expanded to include material previously covered in short videos.</li>
<li><strong>QQQ Stock Selection Mechanism:</strong>  Addresses audience questions regarding the QQQ stock selection mechanism, explaining the advantages of the Nasdaq exchange and why technology companies prefer listing on Nasdaq.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging for Non-US Residents:</strong> Explains the regulations for non-US residents engaging in stock pledging with US brokers.</li>
<li><strong>Learning to Spend:</strong> Shares the philosophy of spending after achieving investment success, emphasizing the importance of focusing on future wealth growth and utilizing financial leverage for consumption.  Don&rsquo;t let wealth sit idle; learn how to use it.  This point is illustrated with the example of a listener who has $4 million but doesn&rsquo;t know how to spend it, calculating their potential wealth growth over 40 years and a reasonable spending level.</li>

<p><strong>IAM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Expressed confusion about different types of economic crises and how the 2020-2023 pandemic period compares to previous bubbles after reading a book about economic crises.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  Which historical economic crisis is most similar to the economic downturn during the 2020-2023 pandemic?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The 2020-2023 pandemic was an economic shock caused by an external event, distinct from previous bubble economies. The 2000 dot-com bubble was an industry bubble with limited impact; the 2008 financial crisis resembled the 1929 Great Depression, both being asset bubble bursts, but the 2008 crisis recovered faster due to quantitative easing. The 2022 market decline was not a bubble burst, but a revaluation caused by central bank interest rate hikes.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> What did the US do to stimulate the economy that other countries couldn&rsquo;t replicate?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The US is less constrained by fiscal discipline and is willing to borrow and issue debt, allocating funds to social welfare programs for the elderly, children, and healthcare, while guiding domestic capital towards overseas investment to mitigate inflation.  Taiwan&rsquo;s government was advised to learn from the US&rsquo;s fiscal spending approach and guide capital towards investment, while also focusing on efficient capital utilization and building a social safety net.</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> Why are Chinese people so keen on buying houses?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> This is a vestige of the agrarian &ldquo;land is wealth&rdquo; mentality, which is no longer applicable today.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eason (Doctor):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Points to consider for Chinese investors buying Nasdaq ETFs:
<ul>
<li>Different brokerage firms have different fee policies and financing rates; careful comparison is necessary.</li>
<li>Domestic Nasdaq ETFs have premiums; buying during periods of low or negative premiums is recommended.  There are no limits for buying ETFs on the exchange, but there are limits for off-exchange subscriptions.</li>
<li>Recommends allocating a portion of assets to USD-denominated investments like QQQ, which can be purchased by opening brokerage accounts in Singapore or Hong Kong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Added:</strong>  Chinese residents have a $50,000 annual foreign exchange quota for overseas investments.  Hong Kong and mainland China identities have different withholding tax rates on US stock investments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dave:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Will the Nasdaq 100 index become stagnant like the Dow Jones index?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Currently, the Nasdaq 100 is the most competitive; excessive worry about the future is unnecessary.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> Is it feasible to only buy the top 10 companies in the Nasdaq 100 index?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The top ten companies change frequently; individual stock selection and portfolio adjustments are too cumbersome, and returns may not be higher.  Investing directly in index funds is more efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> How do VGT and XLK compare to QQQ?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> VGT and XLK track different indices than QQQ, with different constituent stocks and concentration. QQQ is more robust and has broader coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jiawen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Can an 80% leveraged ETF + 10% cash + 10% bond portfolio be directly pledged? How is this done?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, but a small-scale trial is recommended, for instance, borrowing $200,000 against $5 million in principal, or borrowing within $1 million against $10 million. Long-term borrowing strategies should be adjusted according to circumstances. It&rsquo;s possible to pledge only a portion of the stocks, leaving the remainder for additional purchases or other uses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Personal investment journey, transitioning from real estate to stocks, learning about stock pledging and asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Is there synergy between real estate and stock investment? How can real estate cash flow be used for stock investment?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  Buying a house is not recommended for young people. Real estate investment returns are lower than stocks and come with various risks (e.g., natural disasters, property taxes).  Even with positive cash flow, opportunity costs should be considered; investing that capital in stocks might yield higher returns.  Used Texas real estate as an example to illustrate the drawbacks of real estate investment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Qiu Xiao:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  What are the Canadian equivalents of US retirement accounts like IRA, Roth IRA, and 401k? Which account should cash be held in?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Roth IRA corresponds to Canada&rsquo;s TFSA, Traditional IRA to RRSP, and 401k to DCPP. The choice of retirement account for cash depends on the individual&rsquo;s balance between taxable and tax-free accounts and their asset allocation strategy.  One should choose to place cash in either a tax-free or taxable account based on their specific circumstances for tax optimization.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2 (Related to Eason&rsquo;s question):</strong> How can one invest in Nasdaq ETFs in China, and how can quota limitations be addressed?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Off-exchange subscriptions have quota limits, while on-exchange ETF purchases do not, but premiums should be considered.  Opening multiple brokerage accounts or opening an account in Hong Kong for US stock investment can be considered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Haoqing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Used the example of SpaceX launching rockets with a small team to highlight concerns about AI replacing human labor and the difficulties young people face in finding employment.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How can we address the challenge of youth unemployment in the AI era?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  Young people need to acquire AI skills to adapt to the future job market.  Recommends that schools incorporate AI courses into their core curriculum, cultivating AI talent from a young age. Philosophy is an important foundational subject but should not be a primary career focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jimmy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Discussed the changing times and the need for young people to adapt, sharing observations about the youthful demographics of Xiamen. Mentioned the importance of aligning investments with the times and shared some common misunderstandings about investing he had encountered.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What are your views on index fund investing? Is the long-term return of 0050 sufficient? What are your thoughts on individual stock investing (e.g., TSMC)?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Index fund investing is a method accessible to the general public, but many don&rsquo;t understand it and require time and experience to appreciate it. In the long run, QQQ and SPY offer higher returns and are more suitable for long-term investment. Individual stock picking demands specialized knowledge and skills and carries higher risks; it is difficult for average investors to select and hold high-quality stocks like TSMC for the long term.  The key to investing is finding investment targets that can be held long-term and sticking with them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Q&amp;A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TQQQ Pledging:</strong>  Learn about stock pledging and how to achieve interest-free borrowing through the recommended videos.</li>
<li><strong>Top 10 QQQ Holdings:</strong>  Frequent trading is discouraged; holding the index fund long-term is sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>BOX vs. SWVXX:</strong>  BOX is recommended for brokerage accounts to avoid dividend taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Conservative Investing:</strong>  Conservative investing can involve holding cash or holding index funds long-term.</li>
<li><strong>How to Spend Money:</strong>  Focus on future wealth growth and utilize financial leverage for consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Investing in US Stocks from within China:</strong>  Coming to the US to invest or remitting funds to the US for investment is recommended.  Consider opening an account in Hong Kong or using other compliant channels for investment.</li>

<ul>
<li>This chapter introduces the authors&rsquo; motivation and methodology for surveying millionaires and paints a typical picture of an American millionaire: they are mostly self-made entrepreneurs who live frugally and focus on investment rather than conspicuous consumption.</li>
<li>Through analyzing affluent individuals from diverse racial backgrounds and professions, the authors reveal the relationship between wealth accumulation and factors like racial origin and career choices, emphasizing the crucial role of &ldquo;frugality&rdquo; in wealth building.</li>
<li>The authors introduce the concept of &ldquo;Big Hat, No Cattle,&rdquo; referring to the phenomenon that many who appear to be millionaires are not truly wealthy, while many genuine millionaires live modest, frugal lives.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>This chapter delves into the theme of &ldquo;frugality,&rdquo; highlighting it as the foundation of wealth accumulation.</li>
<li>By comparing the lifestyles and consumption habits of &ldquo;Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAWs)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Under Accumulators of Wealth (UAWs),&rdquo; the authors demonstrate the decisive impact of frugality on wealth accumulation. For instance, the contrasting cases of Mr. Ford, a lawyer with high spending habits, and Mr. Richards, a mobile home dealer who lived frugally, ultimately show that Mr. Richards accumulated almost five times the wealth of Mr. Ford.</li>
<li>This chapter points out that most American millionaires are first-generation affluent individuals who practice a lifestyle of saving more than they spend, refraining from splurging on luxury items like expensive clothing, watches, and cars. They accumulate wealth but maintain a moderately frugal lifestyle.</li>
<li>This chapter also introduces a crucial wealth formula: <em>Age multiplied by realized pretax annual household income, divided by 10, minus inherited wealth, equals your expected net worth.</em> Using this formula, readers can calculate their expected net worth and assess whether they are PAWs, UAWs, or &ldquo;Average Accumulators of Wealth (AAWs).&rdquo;</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>This chapter explores the importance of efficiently allocating &ldquo;time, energy, and money&rdquo; for wealth accumulation.</li>
<li>By comparing how PAWs and UAWs allocate these three resources, the chapter illustrates that PAWs prioritize long-term planning, investment strategies, and risk management, while UAWs tend towards instant gratification, impulsive spending, and a lack of financial planning.</li>
<li>This chapter emphasizes the importance of household budgeting, stating that even high earners need to meticulously plan and control expenses to accumulate wealth.</li>
<li>The authors point out that PAWs spend significantly more time on financial planning than UAWs, and PAWs prefer to invest in appreciating assets like stocks and real estate, while UAWs tend to spend their money on consumer goods.</li>
<li>The authors advise readers to manage their household finances like a business, creating a budget, controlling expenses, and regularly reviewing investment plans.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>This chapter uses the car-buying habits of millionaires as an example to further illustrate the principle that &ldquo;being financially independent is more important than displaying high social status.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The authors categorize millionaire car buyers into four types: &ldquo;New-Car Dealers&rsquo; Conservatives,&rdquo; &ldquo;New-Car Shoppers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Used-Car Dealers&rsquo; Conservatives,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Used-Car Shoppers.&rdquo;</li>
<li>By analyzing the purchasing behaviors of these four types, the authors find that &ldquo;Used-Car Shoppers&rdquo; are the most frugal, highly price-sensitive, and adept at leveraging various channels to find the best deals. This group is also the most likely to become PAWs.</li>
<li>This chapter also notes that most millionaires buy American-made cars, and many buy used cars. They believe that cars are depreciating assets and there&rsquo;s no need to spend excessively on new ones.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>This chapter explores the phenomenon of &ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care,&rdquo; where parents provide substantial financial assistance to their adult children, often leading to the children&rsquo;s lack of financial independence and drive, ultimately hindering their ability to accumulate wealth.</li>
<li>By comparing the wealth accumulation of children who receive &ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care&rdquo; with those who don&rsquo;t, the authors illustrate the negative impact of this practice. For example, the case of Rama and Mary, a couple who received long-term financial support from Mary&rsquo;s parents, ultimately developed high spending habits and failed to accumulate wealth.</li>
<li>This chapter analyzes the causes of &ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care&rdquo; and offers suggestions to help affluent parents avoid the tragedy of &ldquo;shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations.&rdquo; For instance, parents should teach their children frugality and financial management instead of solely providing financial aid.</li>
<li>This chapter points out that adult children who receive gifts from their parents generally perform worse in wealth accumulation compared to those who don&rsquo;t. This is because receiving gifts can foster dependence and a tendency to spend the money on consumption rather than investment.</li>

For instance, homemakers often receive more inheritance than working children.</li>
<li>This chapter also emphasizes the importance of choosing executors and suggests that affluent parents select an experienced professional as a co-executor to prevent inheritance disputes among children.</li>
<li>This chapter offers advice to help affluent parents avoid family conflicts when distributing inheritance. For example, affluent parents should establish estate plans early and communicate with their children to ensure their wishes are understood.</li>

For example, the average profit margin of a doctor&rsquo;s office is higher than that of a coal mining operation.</li>
<li>This chapter also analyzes why affluent parents often discourage their children from taking over family businesses and instead recommend pursuing careers as self-employed professionals. This is because self-employed professionals can leverage their knowledge and skills to generate sustainable income, and their careers tend to be more stable and less risky.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote highlights the book&rsquo;s core message: wealth accumulation is not solely based on high income but also relies on frugal habits and smart investment skills. High income doesn&rsquo;t equate to wealth; only by converting income into assets can one achieve true financial freedom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Frugality is the cornerstone of wealth building.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote emphasizes the crucial role of frugality in wealth accumulation. Only by controlling consumption can one free up more funds for investment, leading to wealth growth. Frugality doesn&rsquo;t mean living an austere life but rather being a rational consumer and avoiding unnecessary waste.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To build wealth, minimize your realized (taxable) income and maximize your unrealized income (wealth that is not taxed until it is converted to cash).&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote reveals a vital strategy for wealthy individuals to accumulate wealth, namely, achieving wealth growth through investment rather than solely relying on salary income. One must skillfully utilize tax policies to convert income into tax-advantaged assets like stocks and real estate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not yet wealthy but want to be someday, never purchase a home that requires a mortgage that is more than twice your household&rsquo;s total annual realized income.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote offers practical advice for those in the early stages of wealth accumulation: avoid excessive mortgage burdens and allocate more funds towards investment. When funds are limited, prioritize investment over consumption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Those who are financially independent are considerably happier than those in the same income/age cohort who are not financially secure.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote illustrates the importance of financial security for personal happiness. Possessing sufficient wealth allows individuals to face life&rsquo;s challenges with greater confidence. Economic independence is the foundation of personal freedom and a crucial guarantee of happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Never tell children that their parents are wealthy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote provides valuable educational advice for affluent parents: avoid letting children know about the family&rsquo;s wealth too early to prevent them from developing dependence and a lack of initiative. Children need to understand that wealth is created through their own efforts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No matter how wealthy you are, teach your children to be self-sufficient and frugal.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote emphasizes the importance of frugality and self-discipline. Even children from affluent families should develop good habits to better adapt to future challenges. Children need to understand that frugality is a virtue and a prerequisite for success.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Money is Personified:</strong> Kim personifies money, suggesting it possesses emotions and will. Your attitude towards money influences how it behaves towards you. Respect and treat it like a friend to earn its favor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investing in Superior Entrepreneurs:</strong>  Investing in companies and entrepreneurs more competent than oneself is a wise move, akin to partnering with them and reaping the rewards of their success. The author shares how he invested in successful companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Nike, effectively becoming their &ldquo;partner.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Secret of Compound Interest:</strong>  Compound interest is a fundamental principle in investment, capable of multiplying wealth. However, one must also be wary of its power when applied to debt. The author uses Warren Buffett&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mona Lisa&rdquo; analogy to illustrate the impact of compound interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Strength of Fixed Income:</strong> Stable cash flow surpasses inconsistent income, attracting and accumulating wealth. Kim compares fixed income to a well-trained army, capable of efficiently managing a large-scale organization despite smaller numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Money&rsquo;s Gravitational Force:</strong> Substantial wealth attracts more wealth. Starting with small accumulations, compound interest propels wealth multiplication, much like the Earth formed from the gradual attraction of minuscule particles. The author illustrates this concept with the Han River and the Amazon River, demonstrating how small streams can converge to form vast rivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highest Risk, Lowest Risk:</strong> The stock market is riskiest when everyone is bullish and chasing the latest hot stock; conversely, it&rsquo;s least risky when fear grips the market and everyone is selling.  Maintain a balanced perspective on fear and greed, embracing opportunity during widespread fear and exercising caution when greed prevails. Warren Buffet&rsquo;s famous quote, &ldquo;Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,&rdquo; encapsulates this wisdom.  The author uses the example of increased airline safety a week after an accident to illustrate this point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Treat Others&rsquo; Money as You Treat Your Own:</strong> Treating others&rsquo; money with respect safeguards your own from similar disrespect.  Respect for others&rsquo; money is reciprocated. The author uses his attitude towards shopping carts at supermarkets to emphasize the importance of respecting others&rsquo; money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inheriting Millions with a &ldquo;No Loss&rdquo; Clause:</strong>  Through a hypothetical scenario, Kim highlights that preserving wealth is not straightforward. It requires learning, accumulating experience, and recognizing the significance of consistent income. The protagonist in the story inherits a substantial sum with the stipulation of no loss, ultimately realizing that maintaining wealth&rsquo;s value is no easy feat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rejecting Quick Riches:</strong>  The pursuit of quick wealth often leads to speculative traps and the perils of greed, ultimately ending in failure.  Building wealth demands a steady and gradual approach.  The author uses the analogy of constructing a house to demonstrate the importance of gradual wealth accumulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can Economists Predict the Future?:</strong>  No one can accurately predict the macroeconomic future, especially in the long term, due to inherent uncertainties. Resist blindly following expert predictions; cultivate independent thinking and continuous learning.  Kim quotes economist John Kenneth Galbraith: &ldquo;There are two kinds of people in the world: those who don&rsquo;t know and those who don&rsquo;t know they don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Buying Samsung Stock at Samsung Securities:</strong> This anecdote illustrates the need for knowledge before venturing into investments. Avoid assumptions; understand market rules and investment tools. Kim compares the stock market to a ruthless jungle, where knowledge is essential for survival.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Changing Your Destiny Through Respectful Address:</strong> A personal experience highlights the importance of respecting others and showing genuine interest in their affairs, leading to trust, goodwill, and ultimately, good fortune.  The entrepreneur in the story habitually addresses everyone as &ldquo;that person,&rdquo; ultimately losing friends and connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Repeated Luck is Skill, Repeated Failure is Habit:</strong> Lucky individuals often possess greater astuteness and intelligence. They excel at observation, learning, and accumulating experience.  Conversely, repeated failure calls for introspection and addressing personal shortcomings.  The author uses examples like lottery tickets, rock-paper-scissors, and parking spots to illustrate the interplay of luck and skill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discerning Fact from Investment Hype in News:</strong> Using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example, Kim underlines the importance of focusing on facts and data, rather than blindly trusting media reports and expert predictions. He reached a more accurate assessment by comparing the total number of infections with the infection rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Each Dollar Experiences Time Differently:</strong> Borrowing Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity, the author suggests that money is also subject to the influence of time. Different sources of money experience time differently; always invest with money that has ample time.  Kim compares &ldquo;time-rich&rdquo; money to individuals who have more time to build relationships, fall in love, and raise children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diversification Isn&rsquo;t Enough:</strong> Kim critiques the misinterpretation of the saying &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put all your eggs in one basket.&rdquo; Diversifying within a single market is merely using multiple baskets on the same shelf, still exposed to risk. He recommends spreading investments across diverse markets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Three Paths to Wealth:</strong>  The author outlines three ways to become wealthy: inheritance, winning the lottery, and business success. He encourages young people to pursue entrepreneurship or engage in long-term investment. Kim elaborates on two paths to business success: starting a business or investing in successful companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why Savings Don&rsquo;t Grow:</strong>  The root causes of stagnant savings lie in spending future income, neglecting asset management, undervaluing small amounts of money, and lacking investment knowledge. The author advises readers to ditch credit cards, use debit cards, and appreciate the power of accumulating small amounts of money.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits of Successful Stock Market Investors:</strong> These individuals perceive themselves as business owners, hold high-quality money, and excel at buying at low prices.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Defining True Wealth:</strong>  Genuine wealth encompasses owning a mortgage-free home, a steady stream of passive income, and the mentality of &ldquo;not needing to work.&rdquo; Kim recognizes that the standard of wealth is relative, and true wealth lies in inner freedom.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Harsh Realities of Poverty:</strong> Drawing from personal experience, Kim paints a grim picture of poverty, encouraging readers to believe in their potential for wealth. He underscores poverty&rsquo;s power to strip dignity and even dismantle family relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Three Responses to Financial Panic:</strong>  The author categorizes people&rsquo;s responses to financial panics: those who suffer losses, those unaffected, and those who capitalize and profit. He analyzes the characteristics of each group, noting that individuals with no debt and stable income weather the storm while those who seize opportunities emerge wealthier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rewinding Time for Wealth:</strong>  Reflecting on his experience, Kim encourages young people to start investing early and highlights the limitations of relying solely on bank savings. He suggests young people focus on long-term investments in quality company stocks instead of traditional bank savings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Foundation of Wisdom:</strong> Learning fundamental knowledge is a prerequisite for gaining wisdom.  The author encourages young people to study languages and mathematics, cultivating logical thinking abilities.  He believes learning new languages broadens horizons while studying mathematics sharpens logical reasoning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Immediate Action for Wealth:</strong>  Drawing inspiration from Marie Kondo&rsquo;s organizational methods, Kim recommends readers declutter their homes, fostering respect for possessions, and reflecting on their spending habits. He suggests that the way we treat possessions reflects our attitude towards money; respecting belongings leads to cherishing wealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Will the Stock Market Rise?:</strong>  Don&rsquo;t obsess over short-term market fluctuations. Focus on long-term investment, select quality companies, and patiently wait for value to return. He advises readers to identify quality companies that warrant long-term investment and maintain unwavering confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unlocking the Value of Rent Payments:</strong>  Entrepreneurs consistently paying rent possess the capacity to purchase property. The author encourages them to become property owners and capitalize on the potential for greater returns.  He emphasizes that rental income can translate into property appreciation, while property ownership offers greater security and returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Real Estate vs. Stock Market:</strong>  Instead of fixating on which market is superior, choose an investment approach aligned with your style and risk tolerance. Kim provides a comparative analysis of real estate and stock market investments, highlighting their unique features and potential risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>My Independence Day:</strong>   Using the concept of a personal &ldquo;independence day&rdquo; marked by financial independence, the author emphasizes the significance of economic self-reliance. He encourages readers to develop financial strategies and strive for early financial freedom, recognizing its role as a foundation for personal liberty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Four Skills of Money Management:</strong>  Kim outlines four essential skills for managing money: earning, saving, preserving, and spending. He provides insights into the characteristics of each skill and recommends learning methods. He emphasizes that these are interconnected skills that need to be mastered for effective wealth management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investing with Values:</strong> The author shares his investment principles, avoiding industries that profit from misfortunes. He believes such money carries negative consequences and clashes with his values. He exemplifies this with businesses centered around firearms, cigarettes, and drugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insurance is not Savings:</strong>  Kim criticizes the practice of insurance companies selling high-commission, low-return products disguised as savings. He advises readers to choose insurance primarily for its protection function, not as investment vehicles, and to select suitable products based on their individual needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Beautiful Junk:</strong>  Drawing from a luxurious travel experience, Kim conveys that experiences and memories are more valuable than material possessions.  He urges readers to avoid accumulating &ldquo;beautiful junk,&rdquo; recognizing that many purchases become unused clutter, wasting both money and space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Separating Economics from Political Bias:</strong>  Readers are urged to approach economic news with a critical eye, avoiding interpretation solely from a political standpoint. Refer to factual data to form judgments.  Kim suggests that many media reports are politically charged, encouraging independent thinking and caution against being swayed by media biases.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Underdog Advantage:</strong>  Using historical and business examples, the author illustrates that underdogs overcoming giants is a recurring theme. He encourages young people to embrace challenges and strive for success.

<ul>
<li><strong>Under 100 Million Won:</strong> Prioritize women in the family who have contributed significantly but are often overlooked, such as sisters-in-law, along with nieces and nephews. Buy them gifts, cover family meal expenses, and provide regular financial support to parents. Avoid lending money to siblings for business ventures or assisting parents in upgrading their homes or cars.</li>
<li><strong>Under 500 Million Won:</strong> You can purchase a house or car for your parents, cover all their living expenses, and assist nieces and nephews with education costs. At this stage, you can offer measured support to siblings.</li>

The story features an entrepreneur, Mr. Song, who runs a successful dessert shop and a barbecue restaurant. He pours all the profits back into developing new menu items and his research lab, leading to financial strain at home and his wife&rsquo;s understandable frustration.</li>

He compares investing in a leading company to navigating a well-defined road, reducing the risk of getting lost and generally offering greater security.</li>
<li><strong>The Quarter Rule:</strong>  The author unveils his personal &ldquo;Quarter Rule,&rdquo; advocating for living expenses to be capped at one-quarter of one&rsquo;s financial capacity.  This strategy allows for enjoying life while maintaining a financial safety net.</li>
<li><strong>Prayers Alone Won&rsquo;t Bring Riches:</strong>  True wealth comes through hard work, wisdom, and seizing opportunities, not reliance on divine intervention or supernatural forces. While prayer might offer spiritual solace, it cannot replace action.</li>
<li><strong>Four Habits of Saving:</strong>  Cultivate good habits early in life, starting with simple daily actions that lay a strong foundation for wealth accumulation. These habits are: stretching upon waking, making your bed, drinking a glass of water on an empty stomach each morning, and maintaining consistent sleep and wake times.</li>
