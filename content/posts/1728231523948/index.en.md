## I. Main Topic 
The theme of this session is **Embrace the New Bull Market and Invest Long-Term.** James believes that the global monetary easing policy and the rapid development of AI technology herald the arrival of a new bull market. He advises everyone to invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ or 00662) and view market fluctuations with a long-term perspective.

## II.  Content Summary

* **A new bull market is coming:**  The world has entered an era of loose monetary policy with the start of a rate cut cycle, which will drive the stock market up. This bull market may be a slow one but will continuously rise.
* **Invest confidently in the Nasdaq 100 index fund:** QQQ could increase by 50 times in the next 20 years, with an annualized return of over 20%, making it the best investment target.
* **Individual stocks are unreliable:** Individual stock investment is risky, and in the long run, almost all of them will disappear. They are very difficult to outperform the market in the long term. It is recommended not to waste time and energy on stock selection.
* **Do not invest in the Chinese stock market:** The Chinese stock market is not mature enough; consider investing in it after 30 years.
* **Comparison of household asset allocation in the US and Taiwan:**  American families invest most of their assets in securities to create social value, while Taiwanese families prefer cash, insurance, and real estate, locking up funds in non-appreciating areas.
* **Leveraging through stock pledges:** Using stock pledges to borrow increases liquidity and allows for continued investment to enjoy the benefits of compound growth. With an understanding of asset allocation, the interest cost of borrowing can be almost negligible.
* **Plan for retirement early:** Young people are advised to invest in 00662, and retirees can choose 00646 (SPY) or 0056 according to their fund size.
* **Emphasize family education:** Parents should cultivate their children's financial management concepts from an early age, guide them to make long-term investments, stay away from bad habits such as short-term speculation and gambling, and lead by example.
* **Don't blindly trust high-yield investment products:** Any investment product promising high returns may be a scam. It is important to understand its operating mechanism and learn to discern between true and false.
*  **The dangers of short-term trading:** Short-term trading will miss the best investment opportunities. Long-term investment in index funds will yield more stable returns.
* **The purpose of cash allocation:** It is not for profit, but for dealing with emergencies like unemployment or a market crash. It is advisable to keep more than 10% of your assets in cash.
