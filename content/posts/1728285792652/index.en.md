## I. Main Theme
This session centers around the importance of psychological resilience in investing. James's core message is that mental strength is the key to investment success, while other skills and calculations are secondary. Investors need to maintain a highly optimistic mindset, viewing market fluctuations as opportunities rather than crises in the long run. Long-term investing, rational analysis, and maintaining a healthy mindset are more crucial than striving for precise calculations.

## II. Briefing Content
* **Correction on 401(k) and IRA:** James corrects a statement from the previous session regarding 401(k) and IRA contribution limits, clarifying that the limits for each are independent, but that IRAs have income restrictions. He provides further explanations about the Backdoor Roth IRA conversion, advising listeners to manage pre-tax and after-tax funds carefully to avoid account confusion and complications during tax filing.
* **Asset Allocation Strategy:** He emphasizes the significance of asset allocation and suggests listeners refer to existing articles and Excel spreadsheets for simulations, discouraging impulsive decision-making. He offers various asset allocation plans catering to different risk tolerances and retirement stages, stressing the concept of "fuzzy accuracy" – that it is not necessary to pursue overly precise ratios, but ensuring sufficient cash reserves is crucial. Example: A listener proposes an allocation of 60% QQQ and 40% cash, which James believes carries a risk of bankruptcy and advises them to consult the provided asset allocation plans.
* **Leveraged ETFs and Rebalancing:** Using QQQ's beta value of 1.0 as a benchmark, he simplifies beta calculations for leveraged ETFs, for instance, QLD is considered 2.0. He recommends a gradual approach when adjusting beta during rebalancing, advising against drastic changes. For investors with earned income, the frequency and ratio of rebalancing can be more flexible. Example: He suggests that young investors can rotate investments among QQQ, QLD, and TQQQ every six months, then rebalance at the end of the year.
* **Long-Term Investing and Market Volatility:** James reiterates the importance of long-term investing, using the dot-com bubble of 2000 as an example to demonstrate that long-term investors ultimately profit, even after enduring prolonged market downturns. Market dips are opportunities, and investors should remain optimistic, buying whenever they have funds available. He refutes the notion that "investments in 2000 took 15 years to break even," emphasizing that the market always recovers in the long run. Example: An investment of $5 million at the peak of the market in 2000, despite experiencing the burst of the internet bubble, would still have grown to $32.375 million by 2024.
* **Brokerage Selection:** He advises choosing brokerages with physical branch offices and understanding how stocks and cash are held in custody to ensure asset security. Example: He explains the risks of nominee accounts and recommends selecting brokerages that allow for direct ownership of stocks, encouraging listeners to inquire about the brokerage's custodian banks for stocks and cash.
* **Purpose of Holding Cash:** He underlines that cash holdings are meant for emergencies and to seize buying opportunities during market downturns, not for pursuing interest income. Example: He suggests maintaining a 20% cash position, a portion of which can be utilized for adding to leveraged ETFs during dips.
* **Investment Target Selection:** He recommends selecting suitable investment targets based on individual circumstances. For instance, retirees or individuals with limited funds may consider high-dividend ETFs, while younger individuals or those with ample funds should focus on growth-oriented ETFs like QQQ. Example: Addressing a listener holding SCH, James advises them to assess whether high-dividend ETFs are appropriate based on their asset level and annual expenses.


## III. Q&A Session
**Danny:**
- Shares: He has been following James's investment strategy for three years and achieved a return of approximately 35%.

**Chang'an:**
- Question: Brokerage security and recommendations in Hong Kong.
- James's Response: Choose brokerages with physical branch offices in the region, understand the custodian banks for stocks and cash, and avoid easily dissolved online brokerages.

**Eric:**
- Shares: He began investing during the pandemic, experienced the hardships of short-term trading, and eventually recognized the importance of long-term investing and psychological control. He uses the example of Jesse Livermore to illustrate the risks of trading.

**Jessie:**
- Shares: Both she and her husband are nearing 60 years old, and a portion of their investment funds comes from a mortgage loan. She expresses concerns about a potential market crash and the risk of USD devaluation.
- Questions: 
1. How to cope with a possible future market crash, especially with a mortgage due before retirement? 
2. What about USD devaluation? 
3. Are there risks associated with concentrating large sums of money in a single brokerage account? 
4. Is it feasible to refinance the mortgage in five years or repay it early with funds from the investment account?
- James's Response: 
1. The market is unlikely to experience losses within a 15-year timeframe. Ensure you can comfortably handle mortgage payments for the next 13 years; the most secure approach is to sell the house and repay the loan. 
2. He declines to answer hypothetical questions. 
3. Stocks are registered under the investor's name, hence the risk of brokerage failure is manageable. 
4. Refinancing or early repayment is not recommended. Excessive focus on short-term interest gains is akin to "penny wise, pound foolish," and ultimately increases risk.

**Sam:**
- Shares: He went all-in on QQQ, but after some short-term trading, realized it wasn't suitable for him and experienced psychological pressure due to large position fluctuations.
- Question: How to overcome the psychological pressure brought about by fluctuations in a large portfolio?
- James's Response: 
1. Focus on realized gains rather than unrealized gains. 
2. Maintain 20% cash and 20% leveraged ETFs to stabilize your mindset. 
3. Exercise caution with short-term trading, as it may not be sustainable in the long run.

**Haoqing:**
- Shares: He uses examples of friends gambling and raising children to illustrate the importance of moderate expectations and nurturing interests. He compares and contrasts education philosophies and Nobel Prize achievements between China and the US, emphasizing the significance of financial freedom for the next generation. 


## IV. Highlights
> Mental fortitude is the equipment for investing, it determines whether you will succeed.
> -- James

Investment skills and calculations are undoubtedly important, but psychological resilience is the ultimate factor that decides investment success. Even for simple index fund investing, a sound mental state is needed to navigate market volatility.

> A market downturn is not a disaster, it's an opportunity.
> -- James

From a long-term investment perspective, market downturns provide excellent opportunities to acquire high-quality assets.  Maintain a long-term outlook and don't be intimidated by short-term fluctuations.

> There should be a limit to human pessimism. 
> -- James

Excessive pessimism and worry are detrimental to investments. One should rationally analyze risks and develop sensible coping strategies. Do not let extreme scenarios or low-probability events unduly influence investment decisions.

> Parents sometimes have these expectations for their children, don't impose your unfulfilled aspirations on them.
> -- Haoqing

Parents should respect their children's individuality and interests and refrain from forcing their own unaccomplished goals onto them. Allowing children to have a joyful childhood and the autonomy to choose their own paths in life is more important than chasing conventional success.
