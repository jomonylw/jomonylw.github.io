## II. Briefing Content

### Investment Philosophy and Strategy

*   **Differences between CLEC Investment and Market Books, Influencers:**
    *   **Core Strategy:** CLEC uses the NASDAQ 100 Index Fund (QQQ) as its core, combined with leveraged funds (QLD) and bank pledges for asset allocation, targeting an annualized return of 12%~20%.
    *   **Traditional Investment Education:** Usually only emphasizes large-cap index investing (such as VOO, SPY) or value investing, rarely mentions leveraged funds, and even less involves specific capital operation strategies (such as stock pledges).
    *   **Influencer Finance:** Often oversimplifies investing or recommends various immature investment targets (such as newly issued ETFs), lacking systematicity and risk control.
    *   **Financial Freedom Strategy:** CLEC provides a clear path to financial freedom, including when to start stock pledges, the amount that can be safely withdrawn each year, and how to achieve financial freedom through capital operations, rather than just "saving money + investing."
    *   **Practicality and Executability:** CLEC provides concrete and actionable plans, such as how much assets you need to reach to start pledging, how to adjust asset allocation according to market conditions, while many books and courses only have theory and lack practical guidance.
    *   **Capital Operation:** CLEC emphasizes capital operation through bank credit, wealth management mortgages, stock pledges, etc., to achieve the goal of "borrowing money to invest, borrowing money to spend, and asset appreciation," which is rarely involved in traditional investment education and influencer finance.
    *   **Risk Management:** Emphasizes risk control and has specific coping methods in the event of a downturn.

*   **Comparison with Common Investment Books:**
    *   **"The Psychology of Money":** Emphasizes long-term investing and saving, but CLEC goes a step further by accelerating wealth accumulation through leverage and capital operations.
    *   **"A Random Walk Down Wall Street":** Advocates investing in the broad market index (SPY), but CLEC believes that QQQ has more growth potential and combines leveraged funds and cash for asset allocation.
    *   **Buffett:** Buffett is the representative of value investing, requiring in-depth research on companies and industries, while CLEC believes that ordinary people do not need to have professional knowledge and only need to invest in index funds.
    *   **"Rich Dad, Poor Dad":** Focuses on real estate investment, while CLEC believes that stock investment and capital operations are more efficient and does not recommend investing in real estate.

*   **Investor Growth Process:**
    *   **Beginner Stage:** Learn and practice long-term investing principles, and don't panic and sell (already in the top 20% of the market).
    *   **Advanced Stage:** Learn and use leveraged funds and stock pledges (top 20% of the market).
    *   **Advanced Stage:** Proficient in stock pledges, cash flow management, and asset allocation, and fearless of market fluctuations (top 1% of the market).

*   **Core Investment Philosophy:**
    *   **Mission:** To awaken the capital awareness of ordinary people and help them achieve financial freedom, rather than for traffic and making money.
    *   **Investment Target:** Focus on investing in QQQ, believing in the long-term development of American technology.
    *   **Leverage Use:** Reasonably use leveraged funds (QLD) to magnify returns, but strictly control risk and avoid short-term operations.
    *   **Smart Rebalancing:** According to market ups and downs, dynamically adjust between QQQ and cash (or short-term bonds) to achieve "buy low and sell high."
    *   **Stock Pledge:** Obtain cash flow through stock pledge to achieve "consuming without selling stocks" and ensure continuous asset appreciation.
    *   **Simple and Effective:** The investment strategy is simple and easy to understand, can be executed in the long term, does not require monitoring the market, and does not require stock picking.

### Asset Allocation and Risk Management

*   **Importance of Asset Allocation:**
    *   **Survival Guarantee:** When the market fluctuates violently, reasonable asset allocation is the key to survival.
    *   **Cash is King:** Always maintain at least 20% of cash (or cash equivalents) to cope with emergencies and market declines.
    *   **Dynamic Balance:** Adjust between different asset classes according to market conditions to reduce risk and increase returns.

*   **Importance of Long-Term Investing:**
    *   **Market Trends:** Firmly believe that the market will move upwards in the long run and do not predict short-term fluctuations.
    *   **Patient Holding:** Investing requires time and patience, and wealth accumulation takes time.
    *   **Emotional Control:** Not affected by market sentiment and short-term information, and maintain an optimistic attitude.

*   **Risk Management:**
    *   **Risk Awareness:** Recognize the high risk of investment and be mentally prepared for a possible drop of 50% or even 70%.
    *   **Survival First:** The primary goal of investing is to "stay alive" rather than pursuing short-term high returns.
    *   **Cash Reserve:** Adequate cash reserve is the most effective means to cope with risks.
    *   **Smart Rebalancing:** When the market falls, use cash to buy more QQQ or QLD to lower the average cost.

*   **Stock Pledge:**
    *   **Core Strategy:** Obtain cash flow through stock pledge for living expenses or other investments to achieve "spending money without selling stocks."
    *   **Advantages:** Avoid selling high-quality assets and enjoy the benefits of continuous asset appreciation; achieve the ideal state of "borrowing money forever, never repaying, and no interest."

### Other

*   **About Group Discussions:**
    *   **Focus on the Topic:** Group discussions should revolve around CLEC investment philosophy and strategies, and not discuss content beyond the scope.
    *   **Avoid Misleading:** Do not discuss newly issued ETFs or other investment targets that do not conform to CLEC investment principles.
    *   **Answer Questions:** The group owner and senior students should help new students answer questions.

## III. Q&A Session

### Eason

-   **Sharing:**
    1.  **A-share NASDAQ ETF Premium Issue:** Elaborated in detail the fundamental reasons for the premium of domestic A-share NASDAQ ETFs (such as 513100, 159941, etc.):
        *   **Foreign Exchange Control:** China implements foreign exchange control, and each fund company has a state-approved quota. The quotas of old fund companies are usually tight, resulting in limited off-site subscriptions (suspension or limits), and investors can only turn to buying ETFs on the market, which pushes up on-site prices and forms a premium.
        *   **Market Sentiment:** The A-share market is easily affected by policies, hot spots, and other factors, and rapid capital flows can lead to violent fluctuations in the premium of the NASDAQ ETF. For example, when the market pursues other hot sectors, funds may withdraw from the NASDAQ ETF, leading to a decrease in the premium or even a discount.
        *   **Long-Term Trends:** In the long run, due to the existence of foreign exchange controls and investors' continued optimism about the NASDAQ, the premium will exist for a long time. However, in the short term, the premium will be affected by market sentiment and capital flows.
        *   **On-site and Off-site Differences:** The same fund has different codes and trading methods on-site (exchange-traded funds, ETFs) and off-site (subscribed and redeemed through the fund company). Off-site subscriptions are usually based on the fund's net value, while on-site transaction prices are affected by supply and demand, which may result in premiums or discounts.
    2.  **Impact on Investors:** The premium of the A-share NASDAQ ETF is unfavorable to ordinary investors, especially buying at a higher premium, which increases the investment cost.
    3.  **Investment Recommendations:**
        *   **Long-Term Investing:** If it is a long-term investment, there is no need to worry too much about short-term premium fluctuations.
        *   **Be Cautious When the Premium is Too High:** When the premium is too high (such as exceeding 10%), you can wait appropriately or consider other investment channels.
        *   **Pay Attention to Discount Opportunities:** When a discount occurs, it is a good time to buy.
        *   **Open an Account in Hong Kong:** If conditions permit, you can consider opening an account in Hong Kong to directly purchase US stock QQQ, avoiding premium problems, and you can also allocate leveraged funds (QLD).
    -   **James' Comments:**
        *   Fully agrees with the doctor's analysis that the premium problem of A-share NASDAQ ETF is indeed caused by factors such as foreign exchange controls and market sentiment.
        *   Suggests that investors who are more sensitive to premiums or want greater investment flexibility can consider opening an account in Hong Kong.

-   **Question 1:** After Trump takes office again, will his domestic and foreign policies be very different from the past (including his first term), and will these changes shake the American system?
    -   **James' Response:**
        *   **American Strength:** Clearly stated that the United States is very strong and Trump will make the United States stronger.
        *   **Quality of Political Officials:** American political officials are very good, they are loyal to the country, and can give up personal interests for national interests (for example, many political officials come from Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street investment banks, giving up high-paying positions).
        *   **International Situation:** Touched on international issues without commenting too much to avoid controversy.
        *   **Ukraine Issue:** Believes that the Ukraine issue was caused by Zelensky, who should be responsible for the current situation in Ukraine. Implies that Ukraine is being used by the United States.
        *   **Summary:** Overall optimistic about the United States and Trump's policies, believing that the United States will continue to remain strong.

### Dave

-   **Sharing:**
    1.  **Responding to "National QQQ" Concerns:** Some students worry that if everyone buys QQQ, will it lead to market imbalances or a decline in QQQ's returns. Dave pointed out that this concern is unnecessary.
    2.  **Small Market Value of QQQ:** He provided data, pointing out that the market value of QQQ (about $300 billion) is very small (about 0.5%) relative to the total market value of the entire US stock market (about $62 trillion), and even if more people buy QQQ, it will not have a big impact on the market.
    3.  **The Choice of a Few:** Emphasized that CLEC investors are a minority, not a majority, and the vast majority of investors will still choose other investment methods.
    -   **James' Comments:**
        *   Fully agrees with Dave's point of view, and reiterated that the market value of QQQ is very small and CLEC investors are a minority.

### Haoqing

    2.  **"Individual Stocks" and "ETFs":** He believes that Taiwan's economic model is more like "heavy positions in individual stocks" (TSMC), while South Korea's chaebol model is more like "investing in ETFs" (containing multiple industries and companies).

        *   **Agree with Observations:** Agreed with Haoqing's observations on the economic models of Taiwan and South Korea.

        *   **Focus on Yourself:** Emphasized that Taiwan should focus on developing its own advantageous industries and improve its overall competitiveness, rather than comparing with other countries and regions.

    -   **James' Response:**
        *   **Completely Feasible:** For investors in mainland China, since they cannot purchase leveraged funds, the following strategies can be adopted:
            *   **Office Workers:**
