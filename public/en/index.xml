<li>
<p><strong>The Market is About to Hit New Highs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The market is on the verge of reaching new highs. Entering early is more advantageous than waiting for the new highs to materialize.</li>
<li>Earnings reports from AI and high-tech sectors are projected to surpass expectations. Market funds and corporate profits are also expected to exceed projections.</li>
<li>The market consistently trends upward. Investment requires patience; wealth is worth the wait.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interpreting the Asset Portfolio Research Paper:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long-term bonds carry higher risks than stocks while yielding lower returns. Investment in them is not recommended.</strong></li>
<li><strong>QQQ offers superior returns and risk resistance compared to SPY.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Leveraged funds (e.g., QQQ2D) are characterized by high volatility, substantial downside risk, but also significant upside potential.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Intelligent asset allocation can achieve returns equivalent to a 100% QQQ portfolio while providing greater cash security.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Retirees or individuals without income are advised against using leveraged funds. An 80/20 asset allocation strategy is recommended.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cash is the cornerstone ensuring investors can continue investing.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Additional Investment Advice and Experience Sharing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Retirees should claim their social security benefits as early as possible and utilize them for investments.</li>
<li>Real estate is a liability; selling property for investment purposes is recommended. Avoiding mortgage loans against real estate is advised.</li>
<li>Young individuals can leverage credit loans for investments, accelerating wealth accumulation.</li>
<li>Exercise prudence in investments. Avoid excessive diversification or venturing into unfamiliar domains such as real estate or REITs.</li>
<li><strong>Investing in individual stocks is not advised. Opt for market capitalization-based index funds like QQQ.</strong></li>
<li>Experiencing substantial losses is a prerequisite to appreciating the allure of high returns. The market always presents risks, and one must learn to navigate them.</li>
<li>Short-term safe assets (e.g., treasury bills) are essential components of an investment portfolio, aiding investors in weathering market fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>The higher the proportion of cash or cash-equivalent assets, the greater the risk tolerance of the investment portfolio.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Refrain from self-managing stock portfolios. The returns from most stocks fall short of those from treasury bills.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stock index funds constantly face future risks. Embrace risk tolerance; only by weathering the storms can one see the sunshine.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t put faith in market predictions. During market downturns, &ldquo;stock gurus&rdquo; often emerge, but their predictions are frequently inaccurate.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Adhere to long-term investment principles. Avoid being swayed by short-term market fluctuations.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Marriage and Childbearing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Marriage serves the purpose of creating life to carry on the universe&rsquo;s legacy. Loving one&rsquo;s partner as one would love their own child is paramount to a successful marriage.</li>
<li>Childbearing lies at the heart of life&rsquo;s meaning. Young individuals should marry and have children early, unburdened by financial pressures.</li>
<li>Even without marriage, childbearing should be considered. A life spent single and childless will ultimately lead to profound loneliness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mentions the Chinese government&rsquo;s strong push for policies akin to MMT (Modern Monetary Theory).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is not included in the Nasdaq 100 index, and the NYSE has extended its trading hours to 22 hours, while Nasdaq hasn&rsquo;t followed suit. Why?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Nasdaq&rsquo;s trading hours are already standard. Extending trading hours only affects after-hours trading, holding little significance for ordinary investors. TSMC&rsquo;s exclusion from the Nasdaq 100 index is linked to factors such as trading costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> How can MMT be explained to someone without financial expertise?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> James uses simple language to elucidate the relationship between government deficits and currency issuance. He asserts that governments can cover deficits by printing money without facing national bankruptcy. Using early American history and ancient barter systems as examples, he illustrates how governments utilize currency issuance to purchase goods and services, and how taxation maintains currency value. James emphasizes the essence of US dollar hegemony, highlighting that the US leverages its control over vital resource trading, like oil, to sustain the dollar&rsquo;s global dominance, citing Russia&rsquo;s forced use of dollars for oil purchases as an example. He also points out that the core nature of fiat currency is a representation of national sovereignty, enabling governments to mandate its use through legal means.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IAM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Questions whether investing in QQQ also implies supporting &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; entities.</li>
<li>After comparing returns from QQQ and its top ten constituent stocks, IAM observed higher returns from the latter, leading to confusion about the role of the remaining 90 companies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Does investing in QQQ equate to supporting &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; entities?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> We, as investors, are contributors. Through our investment in QQQ, we allocate capital to the 100 companies making the most significant contributions to humanity, propelling societal progress.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> The top ten constituent stocks of QQQ generate higher returns; what is the purpose of the other 90 companies?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> The composition of QQQ&rsquo;s top ten holdings changes annually. Examining solely the past decade&rsquo;s data is insufficient. Companies previously ranked lower have the potential to enter the top ten, underscoring the vital role played by the remaining 90 companies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> Are companies ranked lower in QQQ&rsquo;s constituents at risk of being removed due to a decrease in their market capitalization percentage?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Typically not, but QQQ mandates that the percentage of any individual constituent stock cannot exceed a specific threshold. Adjustments are made if this limit is surpassed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 4:</strong> How can one view the complete list of QQQ&rsquo;s constituent companies?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> This information can be accessed on websites like Yahoo Finance, which displays QQQ&rsquo;s holdings, or on QQQ&rsquo;s official website.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chunxia:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shares a friend&rsquo;s investment story. This friend works at Apple and previously held steadfast belief in real estate and cash investments. However, recent issues like property taxes have awakened them to the importance of QQQ. Concerns about Apple stock&rsquo;s risk have led them to hesitate about stock pledges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> This friend holds a large quantity of Apple stock. How can they convert it into QQQ, and how should they approach a stock pledge?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The maximum long-term capital gains tax is 20%, regardless of income. James recommends that this friend sell a portion of their Apple stock sooner rather than later, converting it into QQQ to mitigate individual stock risk and reduce future tax burdens.</li>
<li>A gradual sale of Apple stock is advised, such as selling 10% or 20% each year or only selling the appreciated portion to minimize tax liability.</li>
<li>A stock pledge can be utilized for tax payments, for instance, borrowing 20% for tax obligations while reinvesting the remaining funds to enhance investment efficiency.</li>
<li>James suggests experimenting with a stock pledge, such as borrowing 2% for personal use, to gain firsthand experience with the convenience of borrowing.</li>
<li>He emphasizes the critical role of cash. A higher proportion of cash or cash-equivalent assets translates to greater risk tolerance for the investment portfolio.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Owns multiple properties but has refrained from selling due to tax deductions and rising rental income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Should she sell her properties?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Real estate investments lack the return and liquidity offered by QQQ and potentially face substantial inheritance taxes in the future. Selling the properties is advised. Property taxes, maintenance costs, insurance fees, and more erode the returns from real estate investments. Moreover, real estate is illiquid, requiring time for liquidation. Properties, as inheritance, subject heirs to hefty inheritance taxes, potentially creating an insurmountable financial burden.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> How can she convert to a Roth IRA?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> A Backdoor Roth IRA conversion is an option, involving initially depositing funds into a Traditional IRA and subsequently converting them to a Roth IRA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> Can property tax deductions and rising rental income offset the costs associated with real estate investment?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> The deductible amount for property taxes is limited. Moreover, income from rent increases is subject to income tax and cannot fully offset the costs tied to real estate investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 4:</strong> Concerns about mortgages and trusts.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> If a mortgage is obtained under an individual&rsquo;s name, even placing the property within a trust cannot circumvent inheritance taxes. Using an LLC (Limited Liability Company) for property purchase from the outset is recommended, or transferring the property into an irrevocable trust before death to avoid inheritance tax liabilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Professor Zhou:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shares personal and sibling investment experiences. His sister, after experiencing investment losses, is hesitant to redeem her insurance policy. Jenny, due to returns from real estate investment, is reluctant to sell her properties. This illustrates how investors often fall prey to sunk cost and opportunity cost fallacies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How can we enlighten ourselves and those around us to avoid such investment pitfalls?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Understanding the concepts of sunk cost and opportunity cost is essential. Losses from investments should be cut promptly, avoiding attachment to past investments. Seek superior investment opportunities. While Jenny&rsquo;s real estate investment generates cash flow, its return is low, and it may face high inheritance taxes in the future. Therefore, she should consider selling the property and investing in higher-yielding assets like QQQ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bart:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Issues connecting to the room.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Recommends force-quitting the app and re-entering the room before raising a hand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Daisy253:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>New to financial management, past investments were haphazard, primarily focused on real estate and insurance.</li>
<li>45 years old, with an 18-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son, can invest NT$80,000 monthly. NT$10,000 is allocated to children&rsquo;s savings, with the remaining NT$70,000 for personal investment, aiming for rapid asset accumulation to reach NT$10 million.</li>
<li>Owns a rental property generating NT$30,000-40,000 in net monthly income, with principal invested ranging from NT$2 to 3 million, and the property valued at NT$3 to 4 million.</li>
<li>Children lean towards a &ldquo;non-marriage&rdquo; ideology, expressing no desire for offspring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How should assets be allocated, and how can children be guided towards sound financial management principles?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Suggests referencing the article James provided, titled &ldquo;Individuals Still Some Time Away from Retirement,&rdquo; and adopting a BETA 1.2 asset allocation strategy.</li>
<li>Advises against giving children excessive funds at present. Instead, encourage them to save independently once they have a stable income, guiding them to establish proper financial management habits.</li>
<li>Proposes incentivizing children to marry and have children by offering NT$1 million annually in the future.</li>
<li>Emphasizes that 00864B cannot be replaced by 0056. Cash is cash and should not be substituted with stocks.</li>
<li>Underscores the significance of marriage and childbearing, advising early marriage and parenthood, urging them not to be bound by financial anxieties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Xie Weiya:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Recounts the story of a friend working at Apple. This friend steadfastly believed in real estate and cash as investments but recently recognized the importance of QQQ due to concerns like property taxes. However, they remain apprehensive about the risks associated with Apple stock and hesitate to engage in stock pledges.</li>
<li>This friend maintains a high spending level but undoubtedly possesses the financial capacity for retirement. They simply derive great enjoyment from work.</li>
<li>The friend has already contacted Lisa and is preparing for a stock pledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  This friend holds a substantial amount of Apple stock. How can they convert it into QQQ, and how should they approach a stock pledge?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The maximum long-term capital gains tax is 20%, independent of income. James recommends selling a portion of their Apple stock as soon as possible, converting it to QQQ to mitigate individual stock risk and reduce future tax burdens.</li>
<li>A gradual sale of Apple stock is advised, such as 10% or 20% each year, or selling only the appreciated portion to minimize tax liability.</li>
<li>Utilizing a stock pledge for tax payments is suggested, such as borrowing 20% for tax obligations while reinvesting the remaining funds to enhance investment efficiency.</li>
<li>James encourages them to experiment with a stock pledge, perhaps borrowing 2% for personal use, to experience the convenience of borrowing firsthand.</li>
<li>He highlights the vital role of cash. A higher proportion of cash or cash-equivalent assets translates to greater risk tolerance for the investment portfolio.</li>
<li>James advises this friend to learn from investment approaches employed by individuals like Warren Buffett and Wei Ying-ch’ung, leveraging credit for investment purposes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sunny:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How should labor pension funds be withdrawn?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> If proficient in investment, withdrawing the entire labor pension fund at once and investing it in high-yielding assets like QQQ is recommended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wu Liyun:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Is NT$5 million in stocks and cash sufficient for retirement?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>  NT$5 million in assets is insufficient to support a comfortable retirement. Withdrawing a labor pension monthly to supplement retirement income is recommended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nana:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Concerns regarding genetic screening.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Genetic screening is recommended to identify any potential genetic defects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>College Student:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Concerns about Backdoor Roth IRA.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> College students, lacking income, do not require a Backdoor Roth IRA. Directly depositing funds into a Roth IRA is suitable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jessie:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Has 1099 income.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Can 1099 income be deposited into a Traditional IRA?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>  Yes, 1099 income is eligible for deposit into a Traditional IRA. Additionally, a Backdoor Roth IRA can be executed using a spouse&rsquo;s W2 income.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Young individuals should be bold in using borrowed funds for investment to accelerate wealth accumulation.</strong>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Young people are in their prime earning years, with steadily increasing income. They can utilize tools like credit loans to access low-cost capital for investing in high-return assets like QQQ, thereby speeding up their wealth-building journey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cash is the cornerstone ensuring investors can continue investing.</strong>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Market volatility is a constant. Maintaining sufficient cash or cash-equivalent assets helps investors navigate market fluctuations with ease, preventing panic-driven asset sales, ultimately achieving long-term investment objectives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise prudence in investments. Avoid excessive diversification or venturing into unfamiliar domains.</strong>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Focus investments within familiar areas. Refrain from blindly pursuing diversification or investing in unfamiliar domains, such as real estate or REITs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The essence of US dollar hegemony lies in the US leveraging its control over vital resource trading, like oil, to sustain the dollar&rsquo;s global dominance.</strong>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By mandating US dollar settlements for global oil transactions, the US compels other nations to hold dollar reserves, solidifying its global currency dominance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Marriage serves the purpose of creating life to carry on the universe&rsquo;s legacy. Loving one&rsquo;s partner as one would love their own child is paramount to a successful marriage.</strong>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The significance of marriage lies in procreation and the continuation of life. Loving one&rsquo;s partner deeply, treating them as one would treat their own child, is crucial for a lasting and fulfilling marriage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Childbearing lies at the heart of life&rsquo;s meaning. Young individuals should marry and have children early, unburdened by financial pressures.</strong>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Childbearing is inherent to human nature and the perpetuation of life. Young people should courageously embrace the responsibility of parenthood, refusing to be deterred by financial concerns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Investors often fall prey to sunk cost and opportunity cost fallacies.</strong>
&ndash; Professor Zhou</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sunk costs refer to incurred expenses that are irretrievable, such as purchased stocks or real estate. Opportunity cost represents the potential gains foregone by choosing one investment over other available options. During decision-making, investors should not be swayed by sunk costs; instead, they should prioritize opportunity cost, selecting investments offering higher returns.</p>

<li><strong>Market Trends and Investment Philosophy:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Drives the Future:</strong> AI demand is not a bubble, but a genuine driving force behind technological advancement, promising a bull market spanning two decades.  We are currently in the early stages of this growth.  Morris Chang (TSMC Chairman)&rsquo;s perspective and TSMC&rsquo;s investments in AI corroborate this judgment. The long bull market has begun, seize the opportunity to join the wealth train.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility and Long-Term Investment:</strong> Market fluctuations are inherent to investing.  Downswings are followed by even greater upswings. Using historical data from the Taiwan Weighted Index, Nikkei Index, and the US stock market as examples, the session illustrates the long-term market development pattern: an initial period of rapid growth followed by a period of stagnation (e.g., 32 years in Taiwan, 35 years in Japan, 24 years in the US), before entering a phase of stable growth.  Therefore, overcoming panic caused by market volatility and adhering to a long-term investment strategy is crucial for ultimate success.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalism and Investment:</strong>  The side effects of capitalism are wealth disparity and the exploitation of labor. Learn to operate like a capitalist and profit from investment.  Hard work and saving money to buy government bonds will ultimately result in wealth erosion due to inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits of Quantitative Easing:</strong> Quantitative easing is beneficial for investors, fostering a low-interest-rate environment and driving asset price appreciation.  Those who fail to understand quantitative easing and complain about government money printing are often victims of capitalism, missing out on the benefits of asset appreciation.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics of a Mature Market:</strong> Mature markets are characterized by fair, just, and transparent regulatory mechanisms, companies focused on their core businesses, and a high proportion of long-term investors and institutional holdings. The Taiwanese market is gradually maturing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Investment Strategies and Recommendations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invest in Nasdaq 100:</strong>  The session recommends investing in Nasdaq 100 index funds (QQQ), with the option to allocate to S&amp;P 500 or high-dividend ETFs based on individual circumstances.  References to Nasdaq 100 index funds globally are provided for the convenience of investors worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Penny Stocks:</strong>  Refrain from investing in penny stocks, as they generally offer low long-term returns.  Real investment opportunities lie in companies that demonstrate sustained growth and lead technological advancements.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of Stock Pledging:</strong> Stock pledging offers advantages over real estate mortgages, as stocks, unlike real estate, do not depreciate and can be held long-term, potentially allowing for &ldquo;borrowing without repayment or interest&rdquo; (specific instructions are available in related videos).</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Flawed Rebalancing Strategies:</strong> Avoid a 50% principal + 50% leveraged ETF rebalancing strategy, as it carries high risk and can easily deplete cash reserves during market downturns.</li>
<li><strong>Estate Planning and Stock Pledging:</strong> When engaging in stock pledging, it is advisable to diversify assets across multiple brokerage firms, pledging a portion and keeping the rest as cash to facilitate estate handling for inheritors.  Cat supplemented this with a detailed explanation of the stock pledging inheritance process, emphasizing the importance of advance planning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Other Important Matters:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Warning and Disclaimer:</strong>  The content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.  Do not remit funds to unknown accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Program Format Adjustment:</strong>  The presentation content will be expanded to include material previously covered in short videos.</li>
<li><strong>QQQ Stock Selection Mechanism:</strong>  Addresses audience questions regarding the QQQ stock selection mechanism, explaining the advantages of the Nasdaq exchange and why technology companies prefer listing on Nasdaq.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging for Non-US Residents:</strong> Explains the regulations for non-US residents engaging in stock pledging with US brokers.</li>
<li><strong>Learning to Spend:</strong> Shares the philosophy of spending after achieving investment success, emphasizing the importance of focusing on future wealth growth and utilizing financial leverage for consumption.  Don&rsquo;t let wealth sit idle; learn how to use it.  This point is illustrated with the example of a listener who has $4 million but doesn&rsquo;t know how to spend it, calculating their potential wealth growth over 40 years and a reasonable spending level.</li>

</h2>
<p><strong>IAM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Expressed confusion about different types of economic crises and how the 2020-2023 pandemic period compares to previous bubbles after reading a book about economic crises.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  Which historical economic crisis is most similar to the economic downturn during the 2020-2023 pandemic?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The 2020-2023 pandemic was an economic shock caused by an external event, distinct from previous bubble economies. The 2000 dot-com bubble was an industry bubble with limited impact; the 2008 financial crisis resembled the 1929 Great Depression, both being asset bubble bursts, but the 2008 crisis recovered faster due to quantitative easing. The 2022 market decline was not a bubble burst, but a revaluation caused by central bank interest rate hikes.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> What did the US do to stimulate the economy that other countries couldn&rsquo;t replicate?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The US is less constrained by fiscal discipline and is willing to borrow and issue debt, allocating funds to social welfare programs for the elderly, children, and healthcare, while guiding domestic capital towards overseas investment to mitigate inflation.  Taiwan&rsquo;s government was advised to learn from the US&rsquo;s fiscal spending approach and guide capital towards investment, while also focusing on efficient capital utilization and building a social safety net.</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> Why are Chinese people so keen on buying houses?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> This is a vestige of the agrarian &ldquo;land is wealth&rdquo; mentality, which is no longer applicable today.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eason (Doctor):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Points to consider for Chinese investors buying Nasdaq ETFs:
<ul>
<li>Different brokerage firms have different fee policies and financing rates; careful comparison is necessary.</li>
<li>Domestic Nasdaq ETFs have premiums; buying during periods of low or negative premiums is recommended.  There are no limits for buying ETFs on the exchange, but there are limits for off-exchange subscriptions.</li>
<li>Recommends allocating a portion of assets to USD-denominated investments like QQQ, which can be purchased by opening brokerage accounts in Singapore or Hong Kong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Added:</strong>  Chinese residents have a $50,000 annual foreign exchange quota for overseas investments.  Hong Kong and mainland China identities have different withholding tax rates on US stock investments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dave:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Will the Nasdaq 100 index become stagnant like the Dow Jones index?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Currently, the Nasdaq 100 is the most competitive; excessive worry about the future is unnecessary.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> Is it feasible to only buy the top 10 companies in the Nasdaq 100 index?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The top ten companies change frequently; individual stock selection and portfolio adjustments are too cumbersome, and returns may not be higher.  Investing directly in index funds is more efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> How do VGT and XLK compare to QQQ?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> VGT and XLK track different indices than QQQ, with different constituent stocks and concentration. QQQ is more robust and has broader coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jiawen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Can an 80% leveraged ETF + 10% cash + 10% bond portfolio be directly pledged? How is this done?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, but a small-scale trial is recommended, for instance, borrowing $200,000 against $5 million in principal, or borrowing within $1 million against $10 million. Long-term borrowing strategies should be adjusted according to circumstances. It&rsquo;s possible to pledge only a portion of the stocks, leaving the remainder for additional purchases or other uses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Personal investment journey, transitioning from real estate to stocks, learning about stock pledging and asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Is there synergy between real estate and stock investment? How can real estate cash flow be used for stock investment?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  Buying a house is not recommended for young people. Real estate investment returns are lower than stocks and come with various risks (e.g., natural disasters, property taxes).  Even with positive cash flow, opportunity costs should be considered; investing that capital in stocks might yield higher returns.  Used Texas real estate as an example to illustrate the drawbacks of real estate investment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Qiu Xiao:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  What are the Canadian equivalents of US retirement accounts like IRA, Roth IRA, and 401k? Which account should cash be held in?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Roth IRA corresponds to Canada&rsquo;s TFSA, Traditional IRA to RRSP, and 401k to DCPP. The choice of retirement account for cash depends on the individual&rsquo;s balance between taxable and tax-free accounts and their asset allocation strategy.  One should choose to place cash in either a tax-free or taxable account based on their specific circumstances for tax optimization.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2 (Related to Eason&rsquo;s question):</strong> How can one invest in Nasdaq ETFs in China, and how can quota limitations be addressed?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Off-exchange subscriptions have quota limits, while on-exchange ETF purchases do not, but premiums should be considered.  Opening multiple brokerage accounts or opening an account in Hong Kong for US stock investment can be considered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Haoqing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Used the example of SpaceX launching rockets with a small team to highlight concerns about AI replacing human labor and the difficulties young people face in finding employment.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How can we address the challenge of youth unemployment in the AI era?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  Young people need to acquire AI skills to adapt to the future job market.  Recommends that schools incorporate AI courses into their core curriculum, cultivating AI talent from a young age. Philosophy is an important foundational subject but should not be a primary career focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jimmy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Discussed the changing times and the need for young people to adapt, sharing observations about the youthful demographics of Xiamen. Mentioned the importance of aligning investments with the times and shared some common misunderstandings about investing he had encountered.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What are your views on index fund investing? Is the long-term return of 0050 sufficient? What are your thoughts on individual stock investing (e.g., TSMC)?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Index fund investing is a method accessible to the general public, but many don&rsquo;t understand it and require time and experience to appreciate it. In the long run, QQQ and SPY offer higher returns and are more suitable for long-term investment. Individual stock picking demands specialized knowledge and skills and carries higher risks; it is difficult for average investors to select and hold high-quality stocks like TSMC for the long term.  The key to investing is finding investment targets that can be held long-term and sticking with them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Q&amp;A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TQQQ Pledging:</strong>  Learn about stock pledging and how to achieve interest-free borrowing through the recommended videos.</li>
<li><strong>Top 10 QQQ Holdings:</strong>  Frequent trading is discouraged; holding the index fund long-term is sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>BOX vs. SWVXX:</strong>  BOX is recommended for brokerage accounts to avoid dividend taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Conservative Investing:</strong>  Conservative investing can involve holding cash or holding index funds long-term.</li>
<li><strong>How to Spend Money:</strong>  Focus on future wealth growth and utilize financial leverage for consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Investing in US Stocks from within China:</strong>  Coming to the US to invest or remitting funds to the US for investment is recommended.  Consider opening an account in Hong Kong or using other compliant channels for investment.</li>

</h2>
<p>The core idea of this book is how to achieve investment returns that surpass the market average. The author argues that achieving this goal requires &ldquo;second-level thinking,&rdquo; which is deeper and more comprehensive than the thinking of ordinary investors. He emphasizes contrarian investing, being greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy. The book elaborates on important concepts such as market efficiency, value assessment, risk identification and control, cyclical and pendulum awareness, investor psychology, and diversified investment. It also provides a wealth of practical experience and case studies, aiming to help investors establish a sound thinking framework and control the impact of emotions on investment decisions.</p>

    </span>        
    
</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Second-Level Thinking:</strong> To outperform the market, one must engage in second-level thinking, which requires investors to think more deeply and comprehensively, not being satisfied with simple conclusions, but considering various possibilities, probabilities, market consensus, and their own cognitive biases. For example, first-level thinking might conclude, &ldquo;This is a good company, so I should buy it,&rdquo; while second-level thinking would consider, &ldquo;While it&rsquo;s a good company, has the market already overreacted, pushing the price too high?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understanding Market Efficiency and Its Limitations:</strong> Markets are not perfectly efficient; there are opportunities for mispricing. However, due to the large number of investors competing, beating the market remains very difficult. Markets are efficient at incorporating information, but they don&rsquo;t always interpret that information correctly. Investors should focus on relatively inefficient markets, such as those that are less followed, have opaque information, or are controversial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Value Assessment:</strong> The foundation of value investing is accurate estimation of intrinsic value, which requires considering factors such as a company&rsquo;s financial position, management capabilities, profitability, competitive advantages, and future growth prospects. The author emphasizes that value investing focuses more on present value, while growth investing emphasizes future value, but both require considering the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Relationship Between Price and Value:</strong> Successful investing is not about &ldquo;buying good things,&rdquo; but about &ldquo;buying things well,&rdquo; which means buying at a price below intrinsic value. Price is influenced by value, psychology, and technical factors. Investors need to understand the relationship between these three to make sound investment decisions. Buying a good company at a high price can still lead to losses, while buying a lower-quality asset at a low price can yield high returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understanding Risk:</strong> Risk is not volatility, but the possibility of permanent loss of capital. It&rsquo;s crucial to understand the various forms of risk, such as failing to meet objectives, underperformance, career risk, and liquidity risk. Risk is subjective and difficult to quantify, depending on the investor&rsquo;s specific circumstances and goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recognizing Risk:</strong> Risk often increases when market optimism is high and prices are inflated. Be wary of the &ldquo;no risk&rdquo; narrative and recognize signs of an overheated market, such as high P/E ratios, narrow credit spreads, and loose credit conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Controlling Risk:</strong> Risk control is more important than taking risks. Control risk through diversification, limiting risk exposure, adhering to a margin of safety, and avoiding excessive leverage. The results of risk control are often invisible because they manifest in losses avoided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focusing on Cycles:</strong> Everything is cyclical. Recognize the inevitability of cyclical fluctuations and look for opportunities at cyclical extremes. The author uses the credit cycle as an example to illustrate how cycles are self-correcting and how investors can find opportunities within them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pendulum Awareness:</strong> Investor psychology swings like a pendulum between optimism and pessimism, greed and fear. Recognize the patterns of this swing and act contrarianly at extremes. Market extremes often represent turning points and opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resisting Negative Influences:</strong> Resist the influence of negative emotions such as greed, fear, herd mentality, envy, and ego on investment decisions. Recognizing the existence of these psychological factors and striving to overcome them is crucial for making rational investment decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contrarian Investing:</strong> Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy. Contrarian investing is not simply doing the opposite of the crowd; it requires independent thinking and judgment, as well as a deep understanding of value. Contrarian investing can be lonely and unsettling but is key to achieving superior returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Finding Bargains:</strong> Bargains often appear in unpopular and unfavored assets, such as those with apparent flaws, misunderstood by the market, or overlooked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Waiting Patiently for Opportunities:</strong> Don&rsquo;t chase opportunities; wait patiently for them to come to you. Investors should be like baseball hitters, waiting for the perfect pitch instead of swinging blindly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recognizing the Limitations of Forecasting:</strong> Predicting the future is very difficult. Recognize the limitations of forecasting and focus on knowable factors, such as company fundamentals and industry trends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understanding Your Position in the Cycle:</strong> Understand your position within the market cycle and adjust your investment strategy accordingly. Investors can assess market conditions by observing investor behavior, the credit environment, and valuation levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Appreciating the Role of Luck:</strong> Investment outcomes are influenced by luck. Distinguish between skill and luck, and avoid being blinded by short-term success. Investors should focus on long-term performance and analyze the sources of returns, rather than just focusing on short-term gains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diversification:</strong> Diversification is an important risk management tool, but understand correlations and avoid ineffective diversification. True diversification means holding assets that behave differently under different market conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoiding Mistakes:</strong> Avoiding major mistakes is more important than pursuing great success. Identify and avoid various types of errors, such as analytical errors, psychological errors, and failure to recognize cycles and market sentiment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Significance of Value Creation:</strong> Value creation requires superior investment skill. Understand alpha and beta, and strive for asymmetric investment performance, meaning achieving higher returns when the market rises and suffering fewer losses when the market falls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reasonable Expectations:</strong> Set reasonable return expectations and avoid being misled by unrealistic expectations. Excessively high return expectations are often accompanied by excessive risk. Understand how returns are generated and the conditions required to achieve objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Most Important Thing:</strong> Summarizes the core ideas of the book, emphasizing the importance of value assessment, risk control, contrarian investing, and psychological factors. Successful investing requires comprehensive consideration of these factors and the development of a complete investment framework.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a certain irony in the investing world: What&rsquo;s obvious to everyone else is likely to be wrong.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Insight:  Consensus views often lead to average results, at best.  Superior returns require non-consensus views that prove to be correct.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, your goal in investing isn&rsquo;t to earn average returns; you want to do better than average.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Insight:  Complacency is the enemy of superior performance.  Strive to exceed benchmarks, not simply match them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The widespread belief that there&rsquo;s no risk is the biggest risk of all.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Insight:  When markets are universally optimistic, risk is often at its highest because prices don&rsquo;t reflect potential problems.</p>

<p>Insight: Adverse market conditions reveal the weaknesses in portfolios and investment strategies that were hidden during favorable periods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It takes greatest courage, but provides the greatest profit, to buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are greedily buying.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Insight: Contrarian investing is difficult because it requires going against the crowd, but it offers the potential for the highest rewards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One of the great things about investing is that you don&rsquo;t have to make a lot of good decisions to do well. What&rsquo;s essential is avoiding bad decisions.&rdquo;</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>This chapter introduces the authors&rsquo; motivation and methodology for surveying millionaires and paints a typical picture of an American millionaire: they are mostly self-made entrepreneurs who live frugally and focus on investment rather than conspicuous consumption.</li>
<li>Through analyzing affluent individuals from diverse racial backgrounds and professions, the authors reveal the relationship between wealth accumulation and factors like racial origin and career choices, emphasizing the crucial role of &ldquo;frugality&rdquo; in wealth building.</li>
<li>The authors introduce the concept of &ldquo;Big Hat, No Cattle,&rdquo; referring to the phenomenon that many who appear to be millionaires are not truly wealthy, while many genuine millionaires live modest, frugal lives.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li>This chapter delves into the theme of &ldquo;frugality,&rdquo; highlighting it as the foundation of wealth accumulation.</li>
<li>By comparing the lifestyles and consumption habits of &ldquo;Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAWs)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Under Accumulators of Wealth (UAWs),&rdquo; the authors demonstrate the decisive impact of frugality on wealth accumulation. For instance, the contrasting cases of Mr. Ford, a lawyer with high spending habits, and Mr. Richards, a mobile home dealer who lived frugally, ultimately show that Mr. Richards accumulated almost five times the wealth of Mr. Ford.</li>
<li>This chapter points out that most American millionaires are first-generation affluent individuals who practice a lifestyle of saving more than they spend, refraining from splurging on luxury items like expensive clothing, watches, and cars. They accumulate wealth but maintain a moderately frugal lifestyle.</li>
<li>This chapter also introduces a crucial wealth formula: <em>Age multiplied by realized pretax annual household income, divided by 10, minus inherited wealth, equals your expected net worth.</em> Using this formula, readers can calculate their expected net worth and assess whether they are PAWs, UAWs, or &ldquo;Average Accumulators of Wealth (AAWs).&rdquo;</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li>This chapter explores the importance of efficiently allocating &ldquo;time, energy, and money&rdquo; for wealth accumulation.</li>
<li>By comparing how PAWs and UAWs allocate these three resources, the chapter illustrates that PAWs prioritize long-term planning, investment strategies, and risk management, while UAWs tend towards instant gratification, impulsive spending, and a lack of financial planning.</li>
<li>This chapter emphasizes the importance of household budgeting, stating that even high earners need to meticulously plan and control expenses to accumulate wealth.</li>
<li>The authors point out that PAWs spend significantly more time on financial planning than UAWs, and PAWs prefer to invest in appreciating assets like stocks and real estate, while UAWs tend to spend their money on consumer goods.</li>
<li>The authors advise readers to manage their household finances like a business, creating a budget, controlling expenses, and regularly reviewing investment plans.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>This chapter uses the car-buying habits of millionaires as an example to further illustrate the principle that &ldquo;being financially independent is more important than displaying high social status.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The authors categorize millionaire car buyers into four types: &ldquo;New-Car Dealers&rsquo; Conservatives,&rdquo; &ldquo;New-Car Shoppers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Used-Car Dealers&rsquo; Conservatives,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Used-Car Shoppers.&rdquo;</li>
<li>By analyzing the purchasing behaviors of these four types, the authors find that &ldquo;Used-Car Shoppers&rdquo; are the most frugal, highly price-sensitive, and adept at leveraging various channels to find the best deals. This group is also the most likely to become PAWs.</li>
<li>This chapter also notes that most millionaires buy American-made cars, and many buy used cars. They believe that cars are depreciating assets and there&rsquo;s no need to spend excessively on new ones.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li>This chapter explores the phenomenon of &ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care,&rdquo; where parents provide substantial financial assistance to their adult children, often leading to the children&rsquo;s lack of financial independence and drive, ultimately hindering their ability to accumulate wealth.</li>
<li>By comparing the wealth accumulation of children who receive &ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care&rdquo; with those who don&rsquo;t, the authors illustrate the negative impact of this practice. For example, the case of Rama and Mary, a couple who received long-term financial support from Mary&rsquo;s parents, ultimately developed high spending habits and failed to accumulate wealth.</li>
<li>This chapter analyzes the causes of &ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care&rdquo; and offers suggestions to help affluent parents avoid the tragedy of &ldquo;shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations.&rdquo; For instance, parents should teach their children frugality and financial management instead of solely providing financial aid.</li>
<li>This chapter points out that adult children who receive gifts from their parents generally perform worse in wealth accumulation compared to those who don&rsquo;t. This is because receiving gifts can foster dependence and a tendency to spend the money on consumption rather than investment.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>This chapter discusses how affluent parents distribute wealth to their adult children and how they choose heirs.</li>
<li>The authors note that affluent parents often distribute wealth based on their children&rsquo;s professions, gender, and contributions to the family, tending to leave more to children who need financial assistance. For instance, homemakers often receive more inheritance than working children.</li>
<li>This chapter also emphasizes the importance of choosing executors and suggests that affluent parents select an experienced professional as a co-executor to prevent inheritance disputes among children.</li>
<li>This chapter offers advice to help affluent parents avoid family conflicts when distributing inheritance. For example, affluent parents should establish estate plans early and communicate with their children to ensure their wishes are understood.</li>

<ul>
<li>This chapter discusses the relationship between career choice and wealth accumulation, pointing out that self-employed business owners and professionals are more likely to build wealth.</li>
<li>By comparing the profitability and risks of different professions, the authors illustrate why self-employed business owners and professionals are more likely to accumulate wealth. For example, the average profit margin of a doctor&rsquo;s office is higher than that of a coal mining operation.</li>
<li>This chapter also analyzes why affluent parents often discourage their children from taking over family businesses and instead recommend pursuing careers as self-employed professionals. This is because self-employed professionals can leverage their knowledge and skills to generate sustainable income, and their careers tend to be more stable and less risky.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Wealth is not the same as income. If you make a good income each year and spend it all, you are not getting wealthier. You are just living high. Wealth is what you accumulate, not what you spend.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote highlights the book&rsquo;s core message: wealth accumulation is not solely based on high income but also relies on frugal habits and smart investment skills. High income doesn&rsquo;t equate to wealth; only by converting income into assets can one achieve true financial freedom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Frugality is the cornerstone of wealth building.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote emphasizes the crucial role of frugality in wealth accumulation. Only by controlling consumption can one free up more funds for investment, leading to wealth growth. Frugality doesn&rsquo;t mean living an austere life but rather being a rational consumer and avoiding unnecessary waste.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To build wealth, minimize your realized (taxable) income and maximize your unrealized income (wealth that is not taxed until it is converted to cash).&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote reveals a vital strategy for wealthy individuals to accumulate wealth, namely, achieving wealth growth through investment rather than solely relying on salary income. One must skillfully utilize tax policies to convert income into tax-advantaged assets like stocks and real estate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not yet wealthy but want to be someday, never purchase a home that requires a mortgage that is more than twice your household&rsquo;s total annual realized income.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote offers practical advice for those in the early stages of wealth accumulation: avoid excessive mortgage burdens and allocate more funds towards investment. When funds are limited, prioritize investment over consumption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Those who are financially independent are considerably happier than those in the same income/age cohort who are not financially secure.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote illustrates the importance of financial security for personal happiness. Possessing sufficient wealth allows individuals to face life&rsquo;s challenges with greater confidence. Economic independence is the foundation of personal freedom and a crucial guarantee of happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Never tell children that their parents are wealthy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote provides valuable educational advice for affluent parents: avoid letting children know about the family&rsquo;s wealth too early to prevent them from developing dependence and a lack of initiative. Children need to understand that wealth is created through their own efforts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No matter how wealthy you are, teach your children to be self-sufficient and frugal.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysis: This quote emphasizes the importance of frugality and self-discipline. Even children from affluent families should develop good habits to better adapt to future challenges. Children need to understand that frugality is a virtue and a prerequisite for success.</p>

<p>The poor should focus on saving, and the rich should focus on investing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent graduates should focus on increasing their income and savings rate, rather than obsessing over investment decisions, because the growth rate of savings far exceeds the growth rate of investment.</li>
<li>People who have accumulated a certain amount of wealth should spend more time thinking about the details of their investment plan.</li>
<li>The author proposes a &ldquo;Save-Invest continuum&rdquo; concept to help you determine your current financial focus: calculate your expected savings and expected investment growth. Focus on whichever is greater.</li>

<p>You probably need to save less than you think.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many saving recommendations are based on false assumptions: that people&rsquo;s incomes are stable and that everyone has the ability to achieve the same savings rate.</li>
<li>In fact, incomes become more unstable over time, and the biggest determinant of an individual&rsquo;s savings rate is their income level.</li>
<li>The best saving advice is: <strong>save what you can save.</strong></li>
<li>A large body of evidence suggests that retirees generally don&rsquo;t spend enough, with many even increasing their financial assets after retirement.</li>
<li>Today&rsquo;s younger generation is not creating wealth any slower than previous generations, so there is no need to worry too much about running out of money after retirement.</li>

<p>The biggest lie in personal finance: you can get rich just by saving.</p>
<ul>
<li>The effectiveness of reducing spending is limited. For low-income people, spending is already at its lowest level, making it difficult to reduce further. The author uses data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey to support this point.</li>
<li>Increasing income is more effective than reducing spending because as income increases, spending does not necessarily increase proportionately (diminishing marginal utility). The author calls this the &ldquo;law of the stomach.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Five ways to increase your income:
<ul>
<li>Sell your time/expertise: easy to do, but not scalable.</li>
<li>Sell a skill/service: higher income, but takes time to develop skills.</li>
<li>Teach: easy to scale, but highly competitive.</li>
<li>Sell a product: scalable, but requires a lot of upfront investment and ongoing marketing efforts.</li>
<li>Climb the career ladder: traditional but effective, can gain skills, experience and stable income growth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The most reliable way to get rich is: <strong>Increase your income and invest in income-producing assets.</strong></li>
</ul>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most financial advice uses guilt to make you question your spending decisions, causing you to be overly nervous about spending money.</li>
<li>Two tips to help you make financial decisions without worry and spend money without guilt:
<ul>
<li>The 2x rule: When you splurge, invest the same amount of money in income-producing assets or donate it to charity. For example, if you want to buy a pair of $400 shoes, buy $400 worth of stock at the same time.</li>
<li>Focus on maximizing satisfaction: Think about whether your purchase can bring autonomy, mastery, and purpose, thereby increasing your long-term satisfaction. For example, a daily latte might allow you to do your job better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The only right way to spend money is: <strong>the way that works for you</strong>. Think about what you want to get out of life, and make spending decisions accordingly. Research from the University of Cambridge shows that the more your spending patterns match your psychological state, the higher your life satisfaction, and this effect is greater than the happiness brought by your total income.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Lifestyle inflation refers to the increase in spending that follows an increase in one&rsquo;s income.</li>
<li>Some lifestyle inflation is enjoyable, but too much lifestyle inflation will lead to having to delay retirement.</li>
<li>The author simulates the retirement plans of two investors with different savings rates after salary increases to arrive at these conclusions:
<ul>
<li>The lower your current savings rate, the higher your lifestyle inflation can be without affecting your original retirement plan.</li>
<li>The author recommends saving at least 50% of your future raises, a rule that is simple, practical, and suitable for most people.</li>

<p>Debt is not necessarily good or bad, it depends on how you use it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Debt as a form of risk mitigation: Some people, even with savings, keep credit card debt as a strategy to reduce the risk of future funding shortages.</li>
<li>Debt as a behavioral pillar of forced savings: Some people use debt as a behavioral pillar to force themselves to save.</li>
<li>The two most useful types of debt:
<ul>
<li>To reduce risk: for example, keeping cash on hand for emergencies or fixing housing costs.</li>
<li>To earn a return higher than the cost of borrowing: for example, by taking out education loans, business loans, or mortgages to generate higher returns. The author uses data to demonstrate that getting a college degree is often worthwhile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Debt can also have non-financial costs, such as psychological stress and health problems, so non-mortgage financial debt should be avoided as much as possible.</li>

<p>The point of buying a home is not whether to buy it, but when to buy it.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the mortgage, there are a number of one-time and ongoing costs associated with buying a home, such as down payment, closing costs, taxes, maintenance, and insurance. The author details these costs, concluding that buying a home is only cost-effective if the buyer intends to live in it for the long term.</li>
<li>In the short term, buying a home is riskier than renting, but in the long term, renters face greater long-term risks such as rent fluctuations, housing instability, and moving costs.</li>
<li>In the United States, the long-term return on  homeownership as an investment is not ideal, far lower than the stock market. The author uses the example of his grandparents buying a home to illustrate this point.</li>
<li>The right time to buy a home is when you:
<ul>
<li>plan to stay in that location for at least ten years;</li>
<li>have a stable personal and professional life;</li>
<li>can afford a 20% down payment and keep your debt-to-income ratio below 43%. The author recommends, if possible, to make a 20% down payment and buy a larger home in one step, because the transaction costs are lower in the long run.</li>

<p>Why the length of time you save matters?</p>
<ul>
<li>Short-term saving for less than two years: Holding <strong>cash</strong> is the best option, as it has the lowest risk.</li>
<li>Long-term saving for more than two years: Investing in <strong>bonds</strong> is preferable to holding cash because bond returns can offset the effects of inflation. The author compares cash and bonds using two examples: &ldquo;Save $1,000 per month with a goal of $24,000&rdquo; and &ldquo;Save $1,000 per month with a goal of $60,000&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Longer-term saving for more than three years: You can choose to invest in <strong>stocks</strong>, but the risk is higher and you need to choose an appropriate portfolio based on your own risk tolerance. The author uses data to show that stocks have much higher long-term returns than bonds, but also greater volatility.</li>

<p>There&rsquo;s more to consider than just money when it comes to retirement.</p>
<ul>
<li>The 4% rule: When your retirement savings reach 25 times your expected annual expenses, you can retire.
<ul>
<li>You can withdraw 4% of your investment assets (half bonds and half stocks) in the first year of retirement, and increase the amount withdrawn by 3% each year to keep up with inflation.</li>
<li>If you have a pension or other guaranteed income, you only need to save 25 times your &ldquo;annual excess spending&rdquo; (expected annual expenses less future guaranteed income).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The crossover point rule: The point at which your monthly investment income is greater than your monthly expenses, you have reached the &ldquo;crossover point&rdquo; and achieved financial freedom.
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Crossover Assets&rdquo; = Monthly Expenses / Monthly Investment Return.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Retirement is much more than just a financial decision, it&rsquo;s a lifestyle decision. You need to think about what you want to do and how you want to live after retirement. The author uses the examples of several celebrities to illustrate the confusion and emptiness that can exist after early retirement.</li>

<p>Three reasons to make your money grow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save for your future self: Investing allows you to have a pool of resources to draw from as you age. Human lifespans are increasing, and the concept of &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; has emerged accordingly. To ensure quality of life after retirement, it is necessary to invest in advance.</li>
<li>Fight inflation and maintain the purchasing power of your wealth: Investing can offset the impact of inflation and maintain or increase your purchasing power. The author uses data to show that investing can effectively combat the effects of inflation.</li>
<li>Replace your human capital with financial capital: Investing can turn your diminishing human capital into financial capital that can continue to generate returns. The author illustrates this with the example of professional athletes.</li>

<p>There is no single right way to get rich.</p>
<ul>
<li>The author lists a variety of income-producing assets, including:
<ul>
<li>Stocks: One of the most reliable ways to build wealth over the long term, easy to own and trade, with low maintenance costs, but highly volatile and valuations easily influenced by market sentiment.</li>
<li>Bonds: Low volatility, safe principal, and helpful in rebalancing portfolios, but returns are generally lower than stocks, especially in a low interest rate environment.</li>
<li>Investment real estate: Returns are higher than stocks or bonds, especially when using leverage, but require more effort to manage and are difficult to diversify.</li>
<li>Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): Provide access to real estate investment income without needing to manage it yourself, but are more volatile and highly correlated with stocks and other risky assets during stock market crashes.</li>
<li>Farmland: Low correlation with stocks and bonds, low volatility, inflation-resistant, but low liquidity, higher fees, and requires &ldquo;accredited investor&rdquo; status to participate.</li>
<li>Small businesses/franchises/angel investing: Potential for high returns and the more effort you put in, the greater the return, but requires a significant time commitment and has a high failure rate.</li>
<li>Royalties: Can generate stable income that is uncorrelated with traditional financial assets, but sellers incur high fees and public taste changes are unpredictable.</li>
<li>Your own products: 100% ownership, personal satisfaction and achievement, can create a valuable brand, but very labor-intensive and no guarantee of return.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The author also contrasts the characteristics of income-producing and non-income-producing assets (e.g., gold, cryptocurrency, art, etc.) and their respective advantages and disadvantages.</li>

<p>Why underperforming the market is the least of your worries?</p>
<ul>
<li>Most people (even professionals) can&rsquo;t beat the market. Data from the SPIVA report shows that active funds tend to underperform index funds over the long term.</li>
<li>Only a very small percentage of individual stocks outperform in the long run. Bessembinder&rsquo;s research indicates that since 1926, only 4% of stocks have generated returns that exceed U.S. Treasury bonds.</li>
<li>Even stocks that outperform are not always winners. West&rsquo;s statistical analysis suggests that many companies will disappear within a decade.</li>
<li>Choosing individual stocks is emotionally draining and stressful. The author uses the example of his friend Darren investing in GameStop stock to detail the emotional rollercoaster of stock trading.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s hard to tell if you&rsquo;re really good at picking stocks. The link between stock picking decisions and outcomes is not significant, making it difficult to assess your stock picking skills. Even if you have performed well in the past, there is no guarantee that you will continue to do so in the future.</li>
<li>The risk of holding a concentrated position in a single stock is that the return is lower than the market. The author uses data on U.S. stock performance since 1963 to show that the median return of individual stocks is lower than that of index funds.</li>
<li>The author suggests buying index funds or ETFs to earn market average returns, which can lead to higher returns and less stress during the investment process.</li>

<p>Why buying early is better than buying late?</p>
<ul>
<li>Most markets tend to go up most of the time, so investing early allows for a longer period of compounding growth.</li>
<li>The author compares two investment strategies:
<ul>
<li>Buy now: Put all the money you can invest in immediately.</li>
<li>Average in: Invest the money you can invest in batches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conclusion: The <strong>buy now</strong> strategy is generally better than the average-in strategy. The author uses U.S. stock market data from 1997 to 2020, as well as U.S. stock market data from 1920 to 2020, to respectively prove this conclusion. The same results hold when testing other types of assets.</li>
<li>For risk-averse investors, you can choose to invest in a lower risk portfolio. For example, change an 80% stock / 20% bond portfolio to a 60% stock / 40% bond portfolio.</li>
<li>Even if market valuations are high, the buy now strategy is still better than the average in strategy. The author compares the two strategies using CAPE percentile categories, and the results show that the buy now strategy is still superior even during periods of high valuations.</li>
<li>For investors concerned about the risk of a lump sum investment, you can take a longer time to gradually adjust to your target asset allocation.</li>

</h3>
<p>Even God can&rsquo;t beat dollar-cost averaging.</p>
<ul>
<li>The buy the dip strategy only works if the market is about to have a big drop and you can accurately predict when it will happen.</li>
<li>Big market drops don&rsquo;t happen that often, so the buy the dip strategy has a small chance of beating dollar-cost averaging. The author simulates the two strategies using U.S. stock market data from between 1920 and 1980. The results show that in all forty-year investment periods, the buy-the-dip strategy underperformed dollar-cost averaging more than 70% of the time.</li>
<li>Even with perfect information, the buy the dip strategy often loses to dollar-cost averaging because the market may continue to rise while you miss out on compounding growth. The author simulates the two strategies using U.S. stock market data from 1975 onward, again proving this conclusion.</li>
<li>Even if the predicted time of the market bottom is off by only two months, the long-term investment performance of the buy-the-dip strategy still loses to dollar-cost averaging.</li>
<li>Conclusion: <strong>you should invest as early as possible and as often as possible</strong>.</li>
<li>Investment returns are heavily influenced by time, and the power of strategy is far less than the power of market change.</li>

<p>And why you shouldn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<ul>
<li>The year you were born influences your investment returns because markets fluctuate unpredictably. The author illustrates this with data on 10-, 20-, and 30-year investment returns in the U.S. stock market since 1910.</li>
<li>The sequence of investment returns also affects your final return because you invest more money in the later stages of your investment, so later returns are more important. The author illustrates the impact of return sequence with two cases of 20-year investment horizons with the same annualized return but in reverse order.</li>
<li>How to mitigate bad luck:
<ul>
<li>Hold low-risk assets (such as bonds) for the long term to diversify risk.</li>
<li>Withdraw less money during market downturns.</li>
<li>Consider getting a part-time job to supplement your income.</li>

<p>The price of admission for successful investing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoiding too many market declines can limit your upside.</li>
<li>Using the analogy of a &ldquo;market genie&rdquo; that tells you the maximum intra-year drawdown for the coming year, the author simulates different risk aversion strategies. The conclusion is that if you want to maximize long-term wealth, you should accept some degree of intra-year market decline (0% to 15%) and avoid large intra-year market declines (greater than 15%).</li>
<li>Buying a diversified portfolio of income-producing assets over the long term is one of the best ways to combat market volatility as it rears its ugly head.</li>

</h3>
<p>Why you should keep your cool when the market panics?</p>
<ul>
<li>Market crashes are opportunities to buy because every dollar you invest at this point will earn a higher return after the market recovers. The author uses the 1929 U.S. stock market crash as an example to illustrate the excess returns of investing at the bottom of the market.</li>
<li>The more the market falls, the higher the return you need to make up for the loss. The author illustrates this with a simple mathematical formula and chart.</li>
<li>Even if the market takes a long time to recover, buying during a crisis is still a good decision because you can earn a decent annualized return while you wait. The author proves this conclusion using examples of the U.S. stock market falling 30% and 50% between 1920 and 2020.</li>
<li>Most stock markets trend upwards most of the time, and even if a prolonged downturn occurs, the likelihood of losing money is significantly reduced if you make regular investments as most investors do, rather than a single lump sum investment. The author illustrates this with the example of the Japanese stock market.</li>

<p>About rebalancing, concentrated positions, and the purpose of investing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Three situations where you should consider selling an investment asset:
<ul>
<li>Rebalancing your portfolio.</li>
<li>Getting rid of a concentrated (or consistently losing) investment position.</li>
<li>Meeting your financial needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You should have a plan in place before you consider selling investment assets to avoid emotional decisions.</li>
<li>Selling gradually (or selling later) is generally better than selling immediately, because in the long run, the market tends to go up.</li>
<li>Regularly rebalancing your portfolio can reduce risk, but it generally reduces returns. The author simulates two strategies, annual rebalancing and never rebalancing, using a portfolio of 60% stocks/40% bonds, and compares the returns and maximum drawdowns after 30 years.</li>
<li>Accumulative rebalancing is a better way to rebalance by buying asset classes that are underweight over time to avoid incurring tax liabilities. The author uses the same portfolio to simulate a strategy of adding investments each month, demonstrating that this strategy can effectively reduce the maximum drawdown.</li>
<li>For investors holding large concentrated positions, it is advisable to sell some of the assets to reduce risk and meet their own living needs. Selling strategies can range from selling a portion on a regular basis to selling based on price levels, as long as it is decided in advance.</li>

<p>On taxes, traditional 401(k) vs. Roth 401(k), and why you might not want to maximize your 401(k).</p>
<ul>
<li>Tax policy in the United States is constantly changing, and financial management should also be adjusted according to tax policy. The author reviews the history of income tax in the United States to illustrate this point.</li>
<li>When choosing between a traditional 401(k) and a Roth 401(k), the most important factor is whether your effective income tax rate is higher now (during your working years) or later (in retirement).</li>
<li>The author favors traditional 401(k)s because they offer more flexibility and allow you to convert funds to a Roth IRA when tax rates are lower, such as when you are in business school or on maternity leave.</li>
<li>Roth 401(k)s may be a better option for high savers because they can enjoy greater total tax deferral benefits. The author illustrates this with the example of Sally and Sam.</li>
<li>Using a retirement savings account to invest can avoid capital gains taxes, which can lead to significant long-term gains. The author uses simulated data to compare the returns of three approaches: tax-free accounts, accounts taxed once on capital gains, and accounts taxed annually on capital gains. The author also explains the impact of compounding on investment returns.</li>
<li>Maximizing your 401(k) may not be the best option because 401(k) plan fees may offset the tax benefits. The author suggests that you should at least increase your personal contributions to the point where you can receive the maximum employer match. For any contributions beyond that, you need to take into account the 401(k)&rsquo;s expense ratio and your own need for liquidity.</li>
<li>When allocating assets, it is advisable to place high-growth assets (e.g. stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and low-growth assets (e.g. bonds) in taxable accounts.</li>

<p>The most important thing in investing is <strong>maximizing the probability of success</strong>, not maximizing returns. Investors should <strong>control risks</strong>, <strong>avoid being forced to interrupt compounding due to market fluctuations</strong>, and choose investment portfolios that can be <strong>held for the long term</strong>. James emphasizes the importance of asset allocation, especially the role of cash, and the need to choose appropriate investment strategies based on different individuals (retired/not retired, different asset sizes).</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The Most Important Thing in Investing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The goal of investing is to maximize the probability of success, not to maximize the rate of return.</li>
<li>Risk management is to maximize the success of the investment portfolio and avoid interrupting compound growth due to being forced to sell because of market fluctuations.</li>
<li>Good investment assets must be able to withstand fear and panic. The best investment strategies are those that do not create fear and panic.</li>
<li>Sufficient cash is the best asset to help you sleep well and survive a sharp market decline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Stock Pledging:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Stock pledging can easily lead to bankruptcy if asset allocation is not done properly.</li>
<li>Do not try stock pledging lightly if you do not understand the operating principles of stock pledging, otherwise, you will most likely go bankrupt.</li>
<li>Most people do not need to do stock pledging. Good asset allocation can make you rich without pledging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation for Different Individuals:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individuals who are not retired and have salary income:</strong> Refer to the article &ldquo;Asset Allocation for Those Who Are Still Some Time Away from Retirement&rdquo;, with QQQ as the main investment.</li>
<li><strong>Individuals who are retired and have no income:</strong> Refer to the article &ldquo;Asset Allocation for Those Who Are Retired and Have No Income&rdquo;, and choose QQQ, SPY, or high-dividend ETFs for allocation based on asset size, and consider the withdrawal rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Investment and Life Philosophy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Investing is like life. It requires continuous learning and experiencing different stages to find an investment strategy that suits you.</li>
<li>Resist temptation, avoid chasing short-term hotspots, and adhere to long-term investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>A-share Market Volatility:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The A-share market has recently experienced a surge and a plunge, with many investors being trapped due to chasing hotspots.</li>
<li>Market fluctuations are normal, especially in emerging markets. Investors need to be rational and adhere to long-term investment strategies.</li>
<li>The Chinese government&rsquo;s cooling measures are aimed at preventing further expansion of the bubble and protecting the interests of investors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Beware of Pump and Dump Schemes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some online groups and &ldquo;teachers&rdquo; use market forecasts and insider information to induce investors to make trades and profit from them. Be wary of these pump and dump schemes.</li>
<li>The futures market, due to its smaller scale, is more susceptible to manipulation. Be wary of pump and dump schemes in the futures market as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CLEC Investment and Financial Management Channel Update Plan:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Due to the time-consuming nature of producing short videos and the low viewership, we plan to stop updating short videos.</li>
<li>The content of the produced short videos will be condensed into a briefing format and shared with you on Saturdays for discussion.</li>
<li>It is recommended that you listen to long videos several times or listen to them in segments to achieve the same learning effect.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ethan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong> In China, a similar effect to stock pledging can be achieved through the margin financing function of securities firms.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong> The A-share market has recently experienced drastic fluctuations, and many investors have been influenced by the media to chase hotspots, resulting in heavy losses.</li>
<li><strong>Viewpoint:</strong> If you don&rsquo;t have the right understanding of the stock market, you are the victim.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jackie:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>  Her personal journey of investing in the Nasdaq, from skepticism to firm holding, and finally overcoming psychological barriers to achieve &ldquo;buy whenever you have money&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>H:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>  Followed recommendations for meme stocks in 2021, resulting in heavy losses. Started gradually transferring funds to QQQ in 2023 and using leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  The current proportions of QQQ, QLD, and SGOV have deviated from the initial 70%, 20%, and 10%. Is rebalancing needed? How should it be rebalanced?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  It is recommended to adopt a smart rebalancing strategy. Transfer 30% of the QLD profits to SGOV. When the market falls, transfer 2% of the total assets in cash to QLD.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Im:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>  Uses the mural story of Journey to the West as an analogy for the different stages of investment, reminding investors not to chase short-term gains and to adhere to long-term investment and continuous learning.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to persuade people who spend extravagantly to develop the habit of saving?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  You can introduce them to the concept of long-term investment in index funds and the power of compound growth. Provide help within your means.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  If you also have the habit of spending extravagantly, how do you control it?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  Live within your means. As your wealth grows, it is normal for your living standards to gradually improve within the scope of risk control, but avoid excessive consumption and spending beyond your means.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sunny:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>  The CLEC course not only teaches investment knowledge but also conveys life philosophy, helping everyone maintain a stable mindset in life and work.</li>
<li><strong>Viewpoint:</strong>  People with stable emotions are the most valuable. Investing in QQQ also brings peace of mind.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Beisen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background:</strong>  Assets of 70 million, monthly mortgage payment of 125,000.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to allocate assets to achieve early retirement?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  Based on the current assets and expenses, immediate retirement is not possible. It is recommended to try the SPY asset allocation strategy, or use part of the funds to invest in high-dividend ETFs, and control the withdrawal rate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Why has Tesla fallen so much?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  Investing in individual stocks requires understanding the company better than the CEO to grasp the ups and downs of the stock price. If you don&rsquo;t understand Tesla&rsquo;s business model, you shouldn&rsquo;t invest in it.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  If you are very confident in Tesla, can you hold it for the long term?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  If you truly understand and are optimistic about Tesla, you can hold it for the long term, but you must manage risks well.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Does the teacher think the stock market will fall to zero?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  &ldquo;Falling to zero&rdquo; is a figure of speech, which means that even if the stock does not completely fall to zero, it will not be able to be realized if it falls to a certain level, and cash is needed to maintain life.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ming:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>  I have invested in individual stocks before, and they all ended up going to zero in the end, so now I want to learn how to invest in index ETFs.</li>
<li><strong>Background:</strong>  Total assets of 3.3 million, of which 2 million are in a brokerage account, 300,000 are in a Roth account, and 1 million are in a traditional IRA account.  About to retire.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to allocate cash and index ETFs?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  It is recommended to fully invest the brokerage account in SPY, the Roth account in TQQQ, and 60% of the traditional IRA account in money market funds and 40% in SPY.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to withdraw funds after retirement? Do you sell even in a loss state?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  After retirement, you can withdraw 3% of your total assets for living expenses. You can sell SPY or obtain funds through stock pledging loans. You have to sell even in a loss state because you need cash to maintain your life.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Is the risk of investing in TQQQ in a Roth account too high?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  It is to maintain a certain cash ratio while obtaining relatively high returns. In extreme cases, you can transfer cash from the traditional IRA to the brokerage account or sell TQQQ to supplement cash.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to transfer funds from a traditional IRA to a Roth account?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  Transfer out a portion of the money every year and use loans or salary to pay taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Why is the borrowing interest rate 5% and the cash interest rate only 2.5% when calculating interest in SPACE?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  This is just a conservative estimate. The yield of money market funds is usually lower than the borrowing interest rate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sara:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>  I have been investing in QQQ for three years and recently also invested in meme stocks.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  I plan to borrow money to invest. Should I buy QLD? How should cash be allocated?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  Based on Sara&rsquo;s questions, it can be seen that she does not understand the concepts of stock pledging, leveraged ETFs, and asset allocation. Borrowing money to invest is not recommended. It is recommended to continue holding the 80% QQQ + 20% cash portfolio, and cash can be invested in BOXS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to maintain the cash ratio and avoid excessive tax rates in the case of long-term borrowing to live?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Leveraged ETFs and cash should be placed in retirement accounts as much as possible.</li>
<li>Borrowing from a brokerage account should not exceed 70% of the account assets.</li>
<li>Invest Roth IRA in TQQQ and hold cash in a traditional IRA.</li>
<li>In extreme cases, the cash in the traditional IRA can be transferred to the brokerage account or TQQQ can be sold to supplement cash.</li>
<li>The borrowing amount should be controlled within a certain range, for example, not exceeding 2% of the total assets per year.</li>
<li>Taxes incurred by transferring a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA can be paid with loans or salary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Why is the borrowing interest rate 5% while the cash interest rate is only calculated as 2.5% in SPACE?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  This is just a conservative estimate. Money market fund yields are usually lower than borrowing rates.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to handle it if funds in the Brokerage account need to be used before retirement?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  You can use the funds in the Brokerage account for a pledge loan, but you need sufficient cash as a guarantee.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  What if the cash in the Brokerage account is insufficient to cover the loan in the event of an extreme stock market decline?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  In extreme cases, you can transfer the cash in the Roth or Traditional IRA account to the Brokerage account, but this is an emergency measure and will incur penalties.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Is investing TQQQ in a Roth IRA too risky?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  Investing Roth IRA in TQQQ is to obtain higher returns while ensuring a certain cash ratio. If you are concerned about risks, you can appropriately reduce the proportion of TQQQ and increase the proportion of money market funds.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  In the long run, will borrowing from a Brokerage account lead to paying high taxes?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  Borrowing itself does not increase the tax burden, but it can avoid the tax burden caused by selling stocks. However, if you transfer funds from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, it will increase your taxable income for the year and you will need to pay additional taxes.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Money is Personified:</strong> Kim personifies money, suggesting it possesses emotions and will. Your attitude towards money influences how it behaves towards you. Respect and treat it like a friend to earn its favor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investing in Superior Entrepreneurs:</strong>  Investing in companies and entrepreneurs more competent than oneself is a wise move, akin to partnering with them and reaping the rewards of their success. The author shares how he invested in successful companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Nike, effectively becoming their &ldquo;partner.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Secret of Compound Interest:</strong>  Compound interest is a fundamental principle in investment, capable of multiplying wealth. However, one must also be wary of its power when applied to debt. The author uses Warren Buffett&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mona Lisa&rdquo; analogy to illustrate the impact of compound interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Strength of Fixed Income:</strong> Stable cash flow surpasses inconsistent income, attracting and accumulating wealth. Kim compares fixed income to a well-trained army, capable of efficiently managing a large-scale organization despite smaller numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Money&rsquo;s Gravitational Force:</strong> Substantial wealth attracts more wealth. Starting with small accumulations, compound interest propels wealth multiplication, much like the Earth formed from the gradual attraction of minuscule particles. The author illustrates this concept with the Han River and the Amazon River, demonstrating how small streams can converge to form vast rivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highest Risk, Lowest Risk:</strong> The stock market is riskiest when everyone is bullish and chasing the latest hot stock; conversely, it&rsquo;s least risky when fear grips the market and everyone is selling.  Maintain a balanced perspective on fear and greed, embracing opportunity during widespread fear and exercising caution when greed prevails. Warren Buffet&rsquo;s famous quote, &ldquo;Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,&rdquo; encapsulates this wisdom.  The author uses the example of increased airline safety a week after an accident to illustrate this point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Treat Others&rsquo; Money as You Treat Your Own:</strong> Treating others&rsquo; money with respect safeguards your own from similar disrespect.  Respect for others&rsquo; money is reciprocated. The author uses his attitude towards shopping carts at supermarkets to emphasize the importance of respecting others&rsquo; money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inheriting Millions with a &ldquo;No Loss&rdquo; Clause:</strong>  Through a hypothetical scenario, Kim highlights that preserving wealth is not straightforward. It requires learning, accumulating experience, and recognizing the significance of consistent income. The protagonist in the story inherits a substantial sum with the stipulation of no loss, ultimately realizing that maintaining wealth&rsquo;s value is no easy feat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rejecting Quick Riches:</strong>  The pursuit of quick wealth often leads to speculative traps and the perils of greed, ultimately ending in failure.  Building wealth demands a steady and gradual approach.  The author uses the analogy of constructing a house to demonstrate the importance of gradual wealth accumulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can Economists Predict the Future?:</strong>  No one can accurately predict the macroeconomic future, especially in the long term, due to inherent uncertainties. Resist blindly following expert predictions; cultivate independent thinking and continuous learning.  Kim quotes economist John Kenneth Galbraith: &ldquo;There are two kinds of people in the world: those who don&rsquo;t know and those who don&rsquo;t know they don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Buying Samsung Stock at Samsung Securities:</strong> This anecdote illustrates the need for knowledge before venturing into investments. Avoid assumptions; understand market rules and investment tools. Kim compares the stock market to a ruthless jungle, where knowledge is essential for survival.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Changing Your Destiny Through Respectful Address:</strong> A personal experience highlights the importance of respecting others and showing genuine interest in their affairs, leading to trust, goodwill, and ultimately, good fortune.  The entrepreneur in the story habitually addresses everyone as &ldquo;that person,&rdquo; ultimately losing friends and connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Repeated Luck is Skill, Repeated Failure is Habit:</strong> Lucky individuals often possess greater astuteness and intelligence. They excel at observation, learning, and accumulating experience.  Conversely, repeated failure calls for introspection and addressing personal shortcomings.  The author uses examples like lottery tickets, rock-paper-scissors, and parking spots to illustrate the interplay of luck and skill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discerning Fact from Investment Hype in News:</strong> Using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example, Kim underlines the importance of focusing on facts and data, rather than blindly trusting media reports and expert predictions. He reached a more accurate assessment by comparing the total number of infections with the infection rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Each Dollar Experiences Time Differently:</strong> Borrowing Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity, the author suggests that money is also subject to the influence of time. Different sources of money experience time differently; always invest with money that has ample time.  Kim compares &ldquo;time-rich&rdquo; money to individuals who have more time to build relationships, fall in love, and raise children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diversification Isn&rsquo;t Enough:</strong> Kim critiques the misinterpretation of the saying &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put all your eggs in one basket.&rdquo; Diversifying within a single market is merely using multiple baskets on the same shelf, still exposed to risk. He recommends spreading investments across diverse markets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Three Paths to Wealth:</strong>  The author outlines three ways to become wealthy: inheritance, winning the lottery, and business success. He encourages young people to pursue entrepreneurship or engage in long-term investment. Kim elaborates on two paths to business success: starting a business or investing in successful companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why Savings Don&rsquo;t Grow:</strong>  The root causes of stagnant savings lie in spending future income, neglecting asset management, undervaluing small amounts of money, and lacking investment knowledge. The author advises readers to ditch credit cards, use debit cards, and appreciate the power of accumulating small amounts of money.</p>
</li>

      <description>This book, focusing on the psychology of money, states that the key to financial success is not intellect but behavior. Through numerous real-life examples and stories, it reveals the psychological weaknesses, biases, and behavioral patterns that influence human financial decisions, proposing strategies for making smarter choices in personal finance.</description>

<p>The central argument of the book is that financial success is less about IQ and more about how you behave. Author Morgan Housel argues that by understanding the common psychological pitfalls associated with money, we can make better decisions. He illustrates this through a series of compelling stories and case studies, shedding light on our financial decision-making process.</p>

    </span>        
    
</h2>
<p><strong>1. No One&rsquo;s Crazy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People’s unique experiences shape their financial perspectives and actions, leading to seemingly irrational yet logically justifiable behaviors.</li>
<li>For example, low-income individuals might be drawn to lotteries as their perceived only shot at a life-altering fortune.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Luck &amp; Risk</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems, as luck and risk play crucial roles in personal outcomes.</li>
<li>Bill Gates getting into a high school with a computer was luck. His friend Kent Evans dying in a mountain climbing accident was risk.</li>
<li>Recognizing the influence of luck and risk helps avoid over-attributing success or failure solely to personal effort or poor decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Never Enough</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contentment is key in finance. The pursuit of &ldquo;never enough&rdquo; leads to a dangerous cycle of insatiable desire that can ultimately lead to ruin.</li>
<li>Former McKinsey CEO Rajat Gupta and Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff are cited as examples of individuals who lost everything due to greed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Confounding Compounding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compounding’s power lies in long-term accumulation, allowing even small gains to snowball into extraordinary results.</li>
<li>Warren Buffett&rsquo;s immense wealth is attributed not just to skilled investment but to 70 years of consistent investing, highlighting the power of time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Getting wealthy requires taking risks, while staying wealthy requires humility, frugality, and respecting the fleeting nature of good fortune.</li>
<li>Trading legend Jesse Livermore, despite remarkable success, fell victim to overconfidence and excessive risk-taking, ultimately leading to bankruptcy and suicide.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Tails, You Win</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In business and investing, &ldquo;tail events&rdquo; (rare, high-impact events) often disproportionately drive overall results.</li>
<li>Walt Disney produced hundreds of films, but the success of a single one, Snow White, propelled his entire enterprise to unimaginable heights.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Freedom</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The greatest dividend of wealth is the ability to control your time, offering the ultimate flexibility to pursue your passions and spend time with loved ones.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. The Ferrari Fallacy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People care less about your wealth than you think. Their attention is often directed towards their own desires and comparing themselves to you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9. Wealth is What You Don&rsquo;t See</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>True wealth lies not in flashy possessions but in the unseen: financial security, flexibility, and the ability to make choices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10. Save Money</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Building wealth hinges on your savings rate, which is driven by lifestyle choices and managing desires.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>11. Reasonable &gt; Rational</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In financial decisions, making reasonable choices that you can stick with is often more effective than striving for absolute rationality.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>12. Surprise!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>History is full of surprises, so relying solely on historical patterns to predict the future is unreliable. Recognizing the constant possibility of the unexpected is crucial.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>13. Room for Error</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan: Building in a margin of safety is crucial.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>14. You&rsquo;ll Change</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our goals, thoughts, and aspirations change over time. Acknowledging this is essential when making long-term financial plans. Avoid extreme financial goals, embracing the fluid nature of life.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>15. Nothing&rsquo;s Free</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Everything has a price. Success in investing comes with costs: volatility, fear, and uncertainty. Viewing these as fees for a valuable service rather than penalties to avoid helps navigate the emotional rollercoaster of investing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>16. No One&rsquo;s Crazy (Reprise)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid blindly following financial advice from people with different circumstances and timelines than your own.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>17. The Seduction of Pessimism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pessimism often seems more intelligent and gains more attention, even though the world has generally improved significantly over time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>18. When You Believe Anything</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The power of narratives shapes our beliefs. The more we want something to be true, the more likely we are to embrace narratives that inflate its likelihood, especially in high-risk, high-reward scenarios like investing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>19. Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This chapter provides a recap of the key principles and advice from previous chapters to guide sound financial decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>20. Confessions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The author shares his own personal approach to money management, highlighting the importance of seeking financial independence and emphasizing long-term investing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Appendix: A Brief History of the American Consumer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Post-WWII, the US deliberately engineered the American consumer through low-interest rates, consumer credit, and programs like the GI Bill, fostering a culture of consumption and economic growth.</li>
<li>From the 1950s to the 1970s, income distribution remained relatively equitable, the debt was manageable, and confidence in a better future was high.</li>
<li>The 1980s onwards witnessed growing income inequality. The aspirational lifestyles of a small group of prosperous individuals diverged drastically from those of the average person, fostering a culture of keeping up appearances, fueled by debt.</li>
<li>The 2008 financial crisis, a culmination of a debt bubble, exposed the cracks in this system.</li>
<li>Recent years have seen a rise in social unrest tied to income inequality, prompting individuals to question the current economic and social model.</li>
</ul>

<p>This book&rsquo;s core is to guide readers in constructing a mindset of financial independence and encourage them to challenge and break free from the constraints of societal &ldquo;systems.&rdquo; The author argues that modern society, through education, careers, consumerism, and other means, &ldquo;locks&rdquo; people into a preset track, making them work and consume continuously to maintain the system&rsquo;s operation. This book encourages readers to break this cycle by cultivating diverse skills, reducing dependence on a single income and material possessions, and ultimately achieving financial independence and early retirement to pursue a more meaningful life.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>About the Book:</strong> Explains the purpose and core ideas, emphasizing that it&rsquo;s a philosophical book about strategy, aiming to help readers build a framework for financial independence.</li>
<li><strong>A Different Thinking Framework:</strong> Challenges the traditional &ldquo;work-consume&rdquo; model and society&rsquo;s pursuit of material possessions, status, and happiness. It encourages readers to think like a &ldquo;Renaissance person&rdquo; by developing diverse skills and points out the challenges of implementing change.</li>
<li><strong>Locked In:</strong> Delves into how modern people are &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; by consumerism, social norms, and &ldquo;the system.&rdquo; It analyzes how &ldquo;the system,&rdquo; through education, careers, advertising, media, etc., influences individual decisions, limits choices, and creates dependencies.  The book encourages readers to break free from the limitations of &ldquo;the system&rdquo; and re-examine their lifestyles and values. (Example: The allegory of Plato&rsquo;s Cave, illustrating how people are trapped in limited cognition and experience, mistaking shadows for reality).</li>
<li><strong>Degrees of Economic Freedom:</strong> Introduces four economic states: Salaryman, Wage Earner, Businessman, and Renaissance Person. It analyzes their financial characteristics, strengths, weaknesses, and interactions with &ldquo;the system.&rdquo;  The concepts of financial coupling and job dependence are emphasized.</li>
<li><strong>The Renaissance Ideal:</strong> Explains the versatility and independence of the &ldquo;Renaissance person&rdquo; and contrasts it with the modern &ldquo;system&rsquo;s&rdquo; emphasis on specialization.
<ul>
<li><strong>Human Capital and Necessary Personal Assets:</strong> Details the specific meanings and goals of seven areas of competence, emphasizing how these competencies help individuals break free from dependence on &ldquo;the system.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Strategies, Tactics, and Guiding Principles:</strong> Provides strategic and tactical guidance for achieving financial independence.</li>
<li><strong>Tactical Principles:</strong> Offers more specific action guidelines, such as how to identify needs and wants, how to build a modular lifestyle, and how to maximize the use of existing resources.</li>
<li><strong>Economic and Financial Foundations:</strong> Explains the cash flow cycle and how to make money work for you instead of working for money through saving and investing.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Independence and Investing:</strong> Discusses important financial ratios and investment strategies, emphasizing the importance of understanding investment principles and risk management.  (Formulas: N=log[(1)/(1- (Po)/(p)(i)/(1+i))]/log(1+i) and P = (1+0.03/12)/(0.03/12) p = 401 р)</li>
<li><strong>The Renaissance Lifestyle:</strong>  Explores how to implement the Renaissance ideal in aspects such as food, clothing, shelter, transportation, health, relationships, etc., contrasting it with the modern consumerist lifestyle.

<blockquote>
<p>Independence is not something you have; it&rsquo;s something you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Insight:  Independence is a way of thinking and behaving, not a state of being.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You cannot solve a problem with the same mindset that created it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Insight: Achieving financial independence requires a shift from a consumerist mindset to a creative problem-solving approach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be the change that you wish to see in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Insight: Instead of complaining about the system, change yourself and your actions, and influence others by example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best prison has invisible bars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Insight: Modern society subtly confines us through social norms, consumerism, and the education system, making us unconsciously comply.</p>
