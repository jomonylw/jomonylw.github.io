Summary # This book unveils the real lives of American millionaires through a comprehensive survey, shattering the mystique surrounding them. The authors discovered that most American millionaires were not born with a silver spoon but built their wealth from scratch through frugality, hard work, self-discipline, and smart investing. The book also explores the definition of wealth, how to accumulate it, how to raise children, and how to distribute inheritance, offering a practical guide for those who aspire to build wealth.\nII. Chapter Summaries # Chapter 1: Meet the Millionaire Next Door # This chapter introduces the authors\u0026rsquo; motivation and methodology for surveying millionaires and paints a typical picture of an American millionaire: they are mostly self-made entrepreneurs who live frugally and focus on investment rather than conspicuous consumption. Through analyzing affluent individuals from diverse racial backgrounds and professions, the authors reveal the relationship between wealth accumulation and factors like racial origin and career choices, emphasizing the crucial role of \u0026ldquo;frugality\u0026rdquo; in wealth building. The authors introduce the concept of \u0026ldquo;Big Hat, No Cattle,\u0026rdquo; referring to the phenomenon that many who appear to be millionaires are not truly wealthy, while many genuine millionaires live modest, frugal lives. Chapter 2: Frugality: The Cornerstone of Wealth Building # This chapter delves into the theme of \u0026ldquo;frugality,\u0026rdquo; highlighting it as the foundation of wealth accumulation. By comparing the lifestyles and consumption habits of \u0026ldquo;Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAWs)\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Under Accumulators of Wealth (UAWs),\u0026rdquo; the authors demonstrate the decisive impact of frugality on wealth accumulation. For instance, the contrasting cases of Mr. Ford, a lawyer with high spending habits, and Mr. Richards, a mobile home dealer who lived frugally, ultimately show that Mr. Richards accumulated almost five times the wealth of Mr. Ford. This chapter points out that most American millionaires are first-generation affluent individuals who practice a lifestyle of saving more than they spend, refraining from splurging on luxury items like expensive clothing, watches, and cars. They accumulate wealth but maintain a moderately frugal lifestyle. This chapter also introduces a crucial wealth formula: Age multiplied by realized pretax annual household income, divided by 10, minus inherited wealth, equals your expected net worth. Using this formula, readers can calculate their expected net worth and assess whether they are PAWs, UAWs, or \u0026ldquo;Average Accumulators of Wealth (AAWs).\u0026rdquo; Chapter 3: Time, Energy, and Money # This chapter explores the importance of efficiently allocating \u0026ldquo;time, energy, and money\u0026rdquo; for wealth accumulation. By comparing how PAWs and UAWs allocate these three resources, the chapter illustrates that PAWs prioritize long-term planning, investment strategies, and risk management, while UAWs tend towards instant gratification, impulsive spending, and a lack of financial planning. This chapter emphasizes the importance of household budgeting, stating that even high earners need to meticulously plan and control expenses to accumulate wealth. The authors point out that PAWs spend significantly more time on financial planning than UAWs, and PAWs prefer to invest in appreciating assets like stocks and real estate, while UAWs tend to spend their money on consumer goods. The authors advise readers to manage their household finances like a business, creating a budget, controlling expenses, and regularly reviewing investment plans. Chapter 4: You Aren\u0026rsquo;t What You Drive # This chapter uses the car-buying habits of millionaires as an example to further illustrate the principle that \u0026ldquo;being financially independent is more important than displaying high social status.\u0026rdquo; The authors categorize millionaire car buyers into four types: \u0026ldquo;New-Car Dealers\u0026rsquo; Conservatives,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;New-Car Shoppers,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Used-Car Dealers\u0026rsquo; Conservatives,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Used-Car Shoppers.\u0026rdquo; By analyzing the purchasing behaviors of these four types, the authors find that \u0026ldquo;Used-Car Shoppers\u0026rdquo; are the most frugal, highly price-sensitive, and adept at leveraging various channels to find the best deals. This group is also the most likely to become PAWs. This chapter also notes that most millionaires buy American-made cars, and many buy used cars. They believe that cars are depreciating assets and there\u0026rsquo;s no need to spend excessively on new ones. Chapter 5: Economic Outpatient Care # This chapter explores the phenomenon of \u0026ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care,\u0026rdquo; where parents provide substantial financial assistance to their adult children, often leading to the children\u0026rsquo;s lack of financial independence and drive, ultimately hindering their ability to accumulate wealth. By comparing the wealth accumulation of children who receive \u0026ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care\u0026rdquo; with those who don\u0026rsquo;t, the authors illustrate the negative impact of this practice. For example, the case of Rama and Mary, a couple who received long-term financial support from Mary\u0026rsquo;s parents, ultimately developed high spending habits and failed to accumulate wealth. This chapter analyzes the causes of \u0026ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care\u0026rdquo; and offers suggestions to help affluent parents avoid the tragedy of \u0026ldquo;shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations.\u0026rdquo; For instance, parents should teach their children frugality and financial management instead of solely providing financial aid. This chapter points out that adult children who receive gifts from their parents generally perform worse in wealth accumulation compared to those who don\u0026rsquo;t. This is because receiving gifts can foster dependence and a tendency to spend the money on consumption rather than investment. Chapter 6: Rules of Thumb # This chapter discusses how affluent parents distribute wealth to their adult children and how they choose heirs. The authors note that affluent parents often distribute wealth based on their children\u0026rsquo;s professions, gender, and contributions to the family, tending to leave more to children who need financial assistance. For instance, homemakers often receive more inheritance than working children. This chapter also emphasizes the importance of choosing executors and suggests that affluent parents select an experienced professional as a co-executor to prevent inheritance disputes among children. This chapter offers advice to help affluent parents avoid family conflicts when distributing inheritance. For example, affluent parents should establish estate plans early and communicate with their children to ensure their wishes are understood. Chapter 7: Affirmative Action, Family Style # This chapter explores the business opportunities in providing products and services to the wealthy, noting that these opportunities will continue to grow with the increasing affluent population. The authors list several businesses and professions that can benefit from serving the wealthy, including specialized lawyers, healthcare and dental specialists, estate liquidators, educational institutions and professionals, and real estate experts. The authors also analyze the spending habits of the wealthy and point out that they are willing to spend on certain aspects, such as investment consulting, healthcare, and education, which provides significant business opportunities for many industries. Chapter 8: The Perfect Investment # This chapter discusses the relationship between career choice and wealth accumulation, pointing out that self-employed business owners and professionals are more likely to build wealth. By comparing the profitability and risks of different professions, the authors illustrate why self-employed business owners and professionals are more likely to accumulate wealth. For example, the average profit margin of a doctor\u0026rsquo;s office is higher than that of a coal mining operation. This chapter also analyzes why affluent parents often discourage their children from taking over family businesses and instead recommend pursuing careers as self-employed professionals. This is because self-employed professionals can leverage their knowledge and skills to generate sustainable income, and their careers tend to be more stable and less risky. III. Key Quotes # \u0026ldquo;Wealth is not the same as income. If you make a good income each year and spend it all, you are not getting wealthier. You are just living high. Wealth is what you accumulate, not what you spend.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote highlights the book\u0026rsquo;s core message: wealth accumulation is not solely based on high income but also relies on frugal habits and smart investment skills. High income doesn\u0026rsquo;t equate to wealth; only by converting income into assets can one achieve true financial freedom.\n\u0026ldquo;Frugality is the cornerstone of wealth building.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote emphasizes the crucial role of frugality in wealth accumulation. Only by controlling consumption can one free up more funds for investment, leading to wealth growth. Frugality doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean living an austere life but rather being a rational consumer and avoiding unnecessary waste.\n\u0026ldquo;To build wealth, minimize your realized (taxable) income and maximize your unrealized income (wealth that is not taxed until it is converted to cash).\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote reveals a vital strategy for wealthy individuals to accumulate wealth, namely, achieving wealth growth through investment rather than solely relying on salary income. One must skillfully utilize tax policies to convert income into tax-advantaged assets like stocks and real estate.\n\u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re not yet wealthy but want to be someday, never purchase a home that requires a mortgage that is more than twice your household\u0026rsquo;s total annual realized income.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote offers practical advice for those in the early stages of wealth accumulation: avoid excessive mortgage burdens and allocate more funds towards investment. When funds are limited, prioritize investment over consumption.\n\u0026ldquo;Those who are financially independent are considerably happier than those in the same income/age cohort who are not financially secure.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote illustrates the importance of financial security for personal happiness. Possessing sufficient wealth allows individuals to face life\u0026rsquo;s challenges with greater confidence. Economic independence is the foundation of personal freedom and a crucial guarantee of happiness.\n\u0026ldquo;Never tell children that their parents are wealthy.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote provides valuable educational advice for affluent parents: avoid letting children know about the family\u0026rsquo;s wealth too early to prevent them from developing dependence and a lack of initiative. Children need to understand that wealth is created through their own efforts.\n\u0026ldquo;No matter how wealthy you are, teach your children to be self-sufficient and frugal.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote emphasizes the importance of frugality and self-discipline. Even children from affluent families should develop good habits to better adapt to future challenges. Children need to understand that frugality is a virtue and a prerequisite for success.\nIV.

There are no shortcuts to wealth creation; only through diligent saving and rational investment can one steadily accumulate wealth. Wisdom in Raising Children: This book explores how to raise children to be financially responsible individuals, providing insights into the educational experiences and methods of affluent parents and inspiring readers to reflect on their own parenting styles.

Content Summary # This book is divided into two parts: saving and investing. The saving section covers all aspects of saving money, including how much to save, how to save more, and how to spend money without guilt. The investing section covers many aspects of making money with money, including why you should invest, what you should invest in, and how often you should invest. The author answers the most common questions in the field of personal finance and investing, with each chapter exploring a topic in depth and providing practical tips. Using a large amount of data and empirical research as evidence, the author arrives at reliable ways to save money and build wealth.\nII. Chapter Summary # Chapter 1. Where Should You Start? # The poor should focus on saving, and the rich should focus on investing.\nRecent graduates should focus on increasing their income and savings rate, rather than obsessing over investment decisions, because the growth rate of savings far exceeds the growth rate of investment. People who have accumulated a certain amount of wealth should spend more time thinking about the details of their investment plan. The author proposes a \u0026ldquo;Save-Invest continuum\u0026rdquo; concept to help you determine your current financial focus: calculate your expected savings and expected investment growth. Focus on whichever is greater. Chapter 2. How Much Should You Save? # You probably need to save less than you think.\nMany saving recommendations are based on false assumptions: that people\u0026rsquo;s incomes are stable and that everyone has the ability to achieve the same savings rate. In fact, incomes become more unstable over time, and the biggest determinant of an individual\u0026rsquo;s savings rate is their income level. The best saving advice is: save what you can save. A large body of evidence suggests that retirees generally don\u0026rsquo;t spend enough, with many even increasing their financial assets after retirement. Today\u0026rsquo;s younger generation is not creating wealth any slower than previous generations, so there is no need to worry too much about running out of money after retirement. Chapter 3. How to Save More Money? # The biggest lie in personal finance: you can get rich just by saving.\nThe effectiveness of reducing spending is limited. For low-income people, spending is already at its lowest level, making it difficult to reduce further. The author uses data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey to support this point. Increasing income is more effective than reducing spending because as income increases, spending does not necessarily increase proportionately (diminishing marginal utility). The author calls this the \u0026ldquo;law of the stomach.\u0026rdquo; Five ways to increase your income: Sell your time/expertise: easy to do, but not scalable. Sell a skill/service: higher income, but takes time to develop skills. Teach: easy to scale, but highly competitive. Sell a product: scalable, but requires a lot of upfront investment and ongoing marketing efforts. Climb the career ladder: traditional but effective, can gain skills, experience and stable income growth. The most reliable way to get rich is: Increase your income and invest in income-producing assets. Chapter 4. How to Spend Money Without Guilt? # Most financial advice uses guilt to make you question your spending decisions, causing you to be overly nervous about spending money. Two tips to help you make financial decisions without worry and spend money without guilt: The 2x rule: When you splurge, invest the same amount of money in income-producing assets or donate it to charity. For example, if you want to buy a pair of $400 shoes, buy $400 worth of stock at the same time. Focus on maximizing satisfaction: Think about whether your purchase can bring autonomy, mastery, and purpose, thereby increasing your long-term satisfaction. For example, a daily latte might allow you to do your job better. The only right way to spend money is: the way that works for you. Think about what you want to get out of life, and make spending decisions accordingly. Research from the University of Cambridge shows that the more your spending patterns match your psychological state, the higher your life satisfaction, and this effect is greater than the happiness brought by your total income. Chapter 5. How Much Lifestyle Inflation Is Harmless? # Lifestyle inflation refers to the increase in spending that follows an increase in one\u0026rsquo;s income. Some lifestyle inflation is enjoyable, but too much lifestyle inflation will lead to having to delay retirement. The author simulates the retirement plans of two investors with different savings rates after salary increases to arrive at these conclusions: The lower your current savings rate, the higher your lifestyle inflation can be without affecting your original retirement plan. The author recommends saving at least 50% of your future raises, a rule that is simple, practical, and suitable for most people. Chapter 6. Should You Go Into Debt? # Debt is not necessarily good or bad, it depends on how you use it.\nDebt as a form of risk mitigation: Some people, even with savings, keep credit card debt as a strategy to reduce the risk of future funding shortages. Debt as a behavioral pillar of forced savings: Some people use debt as a behavioral pillar to force themselves to save. The two most useful types of debt: To reduce risk: for example, keeping cash on hand for emergencies or fixing housing costs. To earn a return higher than the cost of borrowing: for example, by taking out education loans, business loans, or mortgages to generate higher returns. The author uses data to demonstrate that getting a college degree is often worthwhile. Debt can also have non-financial costs, such as psychological stress and health problems, so non-mortgage financial debt should be avoided as much as possible. Chapter 7. Should You Rent or Buy? # The point of buying a home is not whether to buy it, but when to buy it.\nIn addition to the mortgage, there are a number of one-time and ongoing costs associated with buying a home, such as down payment, closing costs, taxes, maintenance, and insurance. The author details these costs, concluding that buying a home is only cost-effective if the buyer intends to live in it for the long term. In the short term, buying a home is riskier than renting, but in the long term, renters face greater long-term risks such as rent fluctuations, housing instability, and moving costs. In the United States, the long-term return on homeownership as an investment is not ideal, far lower than the stock market. The author uses the example of his grandparents buying a home to illustrate this point. The right time to buy a home is when you: plan to stay in that location for at least ten years; have a stable personal and professional life; can afford a 20% down payment and keep your debt-to-income ratio below 43%. The author recommends, if possible, to make a 20% down payment and buy a larger home in one step, because the transaction costs are lower in the long run. Chapter 8. How to Save For a Down Payment (and Other Big Purchases)? # Why the length of time you save matters?\nShort-term saving for less than two years: Holding cash is the best option, as it has the lowest risk. Long-term saving for more than two years: Investing in bonds is preferable to holding cash because bond returns can offset the effects of inflation. The author compares cash and bonds using two examples: \u0026ldquo;Save $1,000 per month with a goal of $24,000\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Save $1,000 per month with a goal of $60,000\u0026rdquo;. Longer-term saving for more than three years: You can choose to invest in stocks, but the risk is higher and you need to choose an appropriate portfolio based on your own risk tolerance. The author uses data to show that stocks have much higher long-term returns than bonds, but also greater volatility. Chapter 9. When Can You Retire? # There\u0026rsquo;s more to consider than just money when it comes to retirement.\nThe 4% rule: When your retirement savings reach 25 times your expected annual expenses, you can retire. You can withdraw 4% of your investment assets (half bonds and half stocks) in the first year of retirement, and increase the amount withdrawn by 3% each year to keep up with inflation. If you have a pension or other guaranteed income, you only need to save 25 times your \u0026ldquo;annual excess spending\u0026rdquo; (expected annual expenses less future guaranteed income). The crossover point rule: The point at which your monthly investment income is greater than your monthly expenses, you have reached the \u0026ldquo;crossover point\u0026rdquo; and achieved financial freedom. \u0026ldquo;Crossover Assets\u0026rdquo; = Monthly Expenses / Monthly Investment Return. Retirement is much more than just a financial decision, it\u0026rsquo;s a lifestyle decision. You need to think about what you want to do and how you want to live after retirement. The author uses the examples of several celebrities to illustrate the confusion and emptiness that can exist after early retirement. Chapter 10. Why You Should Invest? # Three reasons to make your money grow.\nSave for your future self: Investing allows you to have a pool of resources to draw from as you age. Human lifespans are increasing, and the concept of \u0026ldquo;retirement\u0026rdquo; has emerged accordingly. To ensure quality of life after retirement, it is necessary to invest in advance. Fight inflation and maintain the purchasing power of your wealth: Investing can offset the impact of inflation and maintain or increase your purchasing power. The author uses data to show that investing can effectively combat the effects of inflation. Replace your human capital with financial capital: Investing can turn your diminishing human capital into financial capital that can continue to generate returns. The author illustrates this with the example of professional athletes. Chapter 11. What Should You Invest In? # There is no single right way to get rich.\nThe author lists a variety of income-producing assets, including: Stocks: One of the most reliable ways to build wealth over the long term, easy to own and trade, with low maintenance costs, but highly volatile and valuations easily influenced by market sentiment. Bonds: Low volatility, safe principal, and helpful in rebalancing portfolios, but returns are generally lower than stocks, especially in a low interest rate environment. Investment real estate: Returns are higher than stocks or bonds, especially when using leverage, but require more effort to manage and are difficult to diversify. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): Provide access to real estate investment income without needing to manage it yourself, but are more volatile and highly correlated with stocks and other risky assets during stock market crashes. Farmland: Low correlation with stocks and bonds, low volatility, inflation-resistant, but low liquidity, higher fees, and requires \u0026ldquo;accredited investor\u0026rdquo; status to participate. Small businesses/franchises/angel investing: Potential for high returns and the more effort you put in, the greater the return, but requires a significant time commitment and has a high failure rate. Royalties: Can generate stable income that is uncorrelated with traditional financial assets, but sellers incur high fees and public taste changes are unpredictable. Your own products: 100% ownership, personal satisfaction and achievement, can create a valuable brand, but very labor-intensive and no guarantee of return. The author also contrasts the characteristics of income-producing and non-income-producing assets (e.g., gold, cryptocurrency, art, etc.) and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Chapter 12. Why You Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t Buy Individual Stocks? # Why underperforming the market is the least of your worries?\nMost people (even professionals) can\u0026rsquo;t beat the market. Data from the SPIVA report shows that active funds tend to underperform index funds over the long term. Only a very small percentage of individual stocks outperform in the long run. Bessembinder\u0026rsquo;s research indicates that since 1926, only 4% of stocks have generated returns that exceed U.S. Treasury bonds. Even stocks that outperform are not always winners. West\u0026rsquo;s statistical analysis suggests that many companies will disappear within a decade. Choosing individual stocks is emotionally draining and stressful. The author uses the example of his friend Darren investing in GameStop stock to detail the emotional rollercoaster of stock trading. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell if you\u0026rsquo;re really good at picking stocks. The link between stock picking decisions and outcomes is not significant, making it difficult to assess your stock picking skills. Even if you have performed well in the past, there is no guarantee that you will continue to do so in the future. The risk of holding a concentrated position in a single stock is that the return is lower than the market. The author uses data on U.S. stock performance since 1963 to show that the median return of individual stocks is lower than that of index funds. The author suggests buying index funds or ETFs to earn market average returns, which can lead to higher returns and less stress during the investment process. Chapter 13. How Early Should You Start Investing? # Why buying early is better than buying late?\nMost markets tend to go up most of the time, so investing early allows for a longer period of compounding growth. The author compares two investment strategies: Buy now: Put all the money you can invest in immediately. Average in: Invest the money you can invest in batches. Conclusion: The buy now strategy is generally better than the average-in strategy. The author uses U.S. stock market data from 1997 to 2020, as well as U.S. stock market data from 1920 to 2020, to respectively prove this conclusion. The same results hold when testing other types of assets. For risk-averse investors, you can choose to invest in a lower risk portfolio. For example, change an 80% stock / 20% bond portfolio to a 60% stock / 40% bond portfolio. Even if market valuations are high, the buy now strategy is still better than the average in strategy. The author compares the two strategies using CAPE percentile categories, and the results show that the buy now strategy is still superior even during periods of high valuations. For investors concerned about the risk of a lump sum investment, you can take a longer time to gradually adjust to your target asset allocation. Chapter 14. Why You Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t Wait to Buy the Dip? # Even God can\u0026rsquo;t beat dollar-cost averaging.\nThe buy the dip strategy only works if the market is about to have a big drop and you can accurately predict when it will happen. Big market drops don\u0026rsquo;t happen that often, so the buy the dip strategy has a small chance of beating dollar-cost averaging. The author simulates the two strategies using U.S. stock market data from between 1920 and 1980. The results show that in all forty-year investment periods, the buy-the-dip strategy underperformed dollar-cost averaging more than 70% of the time. Even with perfect information, the buy the dip strategy often loses to dollar-cost averaging because the market may continue to rise while you miss out on compounding growth. The author simulates the two strategies using U.S. stock market data from 1975 onward, again proving this conclusion. Even if the predicted time of the market bottom is off by only two months, the long-term investment performance of the buy-the-dip strategy still loses to dollar-cost averaging. Conclusion: you should invest as early as possible and as often as possible. Investment returns are heavily influenced by time, and the power of strategy is far less than the power of market change. Chapter 15. Why Does Investing Involve Luck? # And why you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t care.\nThe year you were born influences your investment returns because markets fluctuate unpredictably. The author illustrates this with data on 10-, 20-, and 30-year investment returns in the U.S. stock market since 1910. The sequence of investment returns also affects your final return because you invest more money in the later stages of your investment, so later returns are more important. The author illustrates the impact of return sequence with two cases of 20-year investment horizons with the same annualized return but in reverse order. How to mitigate bad luck: Hold low-risk assets (such as bonds) for the long term to diversify risk. Withdraw less money during market downturns. Consider getting a part-time job to supplement your income. Chapter 16. Why You Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t Fear Market Volatility? # The price of admission for successful investing.\nAvoiding too many market declines can limit your upside. Using the analogy of a \u0026ldquo;market genie\u0026rdquo; that tells you the maximum intra-year drawdown for the coming year, the author simulates different risk aversion strategies. The conclusion is that if you want to maximize long-term wealth, you should accept some degree of intra-year market decline (0% to 15%) and avoid large intra-year market declines (greater than 15%). Buying a diversified portfolio of income-producing assets over the long term is one of the best ways to combat market volatility as it rears its ugly head. Chapter 17. How to Buy During a Crisis? # Why you should keep your cool when the market panics?\nMarket crashes are opportunities to buy because every dollar you invest at this point will earn a higher return after the market recovers. The author uses the 1929 U.S. stock market crash as an example to illustrate the excess returns of investing at the bottom of the market. The more the market falls, the higher the return you need to make up for the loss. The author illustrates this with a simple mathematical formula and chart. Even if the market takes a long time to recover, buying during a crisis is still a good decision because you can earn a decent annualized return while you wait. The author proves this conclusion using examples of the U.S. stock market falling 30% and 50% between 1920 and 2020. Most stock markets trend upwards most of the time, and even if a prolonged downturn occurs, the likelihood of losing money is significantly reduced if you make regular investments as most investors do, rather than a single lump sum investment. The author illustrates this with the example of the Japanese stock market. Chapter 18. When Should You Sell? # About rebalancing, concentrated positions, and the purpose of investing.\nThree situations where you should consider selling an investment asset: Rebalancing your portfolio. Getting rid of a concentrated (or consistently losing) investment position. Meeting your financial needs. You should have a plan in place before you consider selling investment assets to avoid emotional decisions. Selling gradually (or selling later) is generally better than selling immediately, because in the long run, the market tends to go up. Regularly rebalancing your portfolio can reduce risk, but it generally reduces returns. The author simulates two strategies, annual rebalancing and never rebalancing, using a portfolio of 60% stocks/40% bonds, and compares the returns and maximum drawdowns after 30 years. Accumulative rebalancing is a better way to rebalance by buying asset classes that are underweight over time to avoid incurring tax liabilities. The author uses the same portfolio to simulate a strategy of adding investments each month, demonstrating that this strategy can effectively reduce the maximum drawdown. For investors holding large concentrated positions, it is advisable to sell some of the assets to reduce risk and meet their own living needs. Selling strategies can range from selling a portion on a regular basis to selling based on price levels, as long as it is decided in advance. Chapter 19. Where Should Your Investments Be Held? # On taxes, traditional 401(k) vs. Roth 401(k), and why you might not want to maximize your 401(k).\nTax policy in the United States is constantly changing, and financial management should also be adjusted according to tax policy. The author reviews the history of income tax in the United States to illustrate this point. When choosing between a traditional 401(k) and a Roth 401(k), the most important factor is whether your effective income tax rate is higher now (during your working years) or later (in retirement). The author favors traditional 401(k)s because they offer more flexibility and allow you to convert funds to a Roth IRA when tax rates are lower, such as when you are in business school or on maternity leave. Roth 401(k)s may be a better option for high savers because they can enjoy greater total tax deferral benefits. The author illustrates this with the example of Sally and Sam. Using a retirement savings account to invest can avoid capital gains taxes, which can lead to significant long-term gains. The author uses simulated data to compare the returns of three approaches: tax-free accounts, accounts taxed once on capital gains, and accounts taxed annually on capital gains. The author also explains the impact of compounding on investment returns. Maximizing your 401(k) may not be the best option because 401(k) plan fees may offset the tax benefits. The author suggests that you should at least increase your personal contributions to the point where you can receive the maximum employer match. For any contributions beyond that, you need to take into account the 401(k)\u0026rsquo;s expense ratio and your own need for liquidity. When allocating assets, it is advisable to place high-growth assets (e.g. stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and low-growth assets (e.g. bonds) in taxable accounts. Chapter 20. Why Will You Never Feel Rich? # You might already be rich, so why not?\nPeople can always find someone richer than themselves, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to feel content. The author illustrates people\u0026rsquo;s sense of relative wealth by telling the story of Powerball lottery winner Jack Whittaker, and the story of his friend John. If you compare yourself to people around the world, you may find that you are much richer than you think. For example, if your net worth is over $4,210, you are wealthier than half the world; if your net worth is over $93,170, you are in the top 10% of the world\u0026rsquo;s wealth. Don\u0026rsquo;t let feelings of relative wealth affect your happiness and appreciate the wealth you have. Chapter 21. The Most Important Asset # Why you can never get more of this asset.\nTime is your most important asset, and how you use your time will have a huge impact on your future life. The author tells the story of Dashrath Manjhi, an Indian villager who carved a road through a mountain, to illustrate the power of time. In your younger years, you should prioritize career development because that\u0026rsquo;s when your income grows the fastest. The author uses his own experience to illustrate the importance of making the right career choices early on. Don\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice your time in pursuit of money, because you can never buy more time with money. People\u0026rsquo;s happiness tends to follow a U-shaped curve as they age, overestimating their future happiness in their youth, being more pessimistic in middle age, and feeling pleasantly surprised in old age. Conclusion. The Just Keep Buying Rules # How to win the time traveler\u0026rsquo;s game?\nThe author summarizes 21 financial guidelines to help you succeed on your financial journey, these guidelines are called the \u0026ldquo;Just Keep Buying Rules\u0026rdquo;: The poor should focus on saving, and the rich should focus on investing. Save what you can save. Focus on income, not expenses. Use the \u0026ldquo;2x rule\u0026rdquo; to eliminate spending guilt. Save at least 50% of your future raises and bonuses. Debt is not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing, it depends on how you use it. Only buy a house when the timing is right. Use cash when saving for large purchases. There\u0026rsquo;s more to retirement than just money. Invest to accumulate financial capital to replace your diminishing human capital. Think like an owner and buy income-producing assets. Don\u0026rsquo;t buy individual stocks. Buy fast, sell slow. Invest as early and as often as possible. Investing is not just about the cards you have, it\u0026rsquo;s also about how you play them. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid when volatility inevitably comes. Market crashes are usually opportunities to buy. Use your money for the life you need before risking it for the life you want. Think twice before maximizing your 401(k). You\u0026rsquo;ll never feel rich, and that\u0026rsquo;s okay. Time is your most important asset. III. Quotes # The surest way to get rich is to increase your income and invest in income-producing assets.\nAnalysis: Instead of blindly pursuing saving, it is better to focus your energy on increasing your income and investing in assets that can generate income; this is a more reliable path to financial freedom.\nThe only right way to spend money is the way that works for you.\nAnalysis: Everyone\u0026rsquo;s values, life goals, and preferences are different, so their financial management style should also be personalized. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly follow the crowd; find a spending pattern that suits you in order to achieve true happiness.\nTime is your most important asset.\nAnalysis: Time is a non-renewable resource. We should cherish time and spend it on the most valuable things. Investing early is not only about accumulating wealth, but also about buying back more time and freedom.\nIV.

Main Topic # The most important thing in investing is maximizing the probability of success, not maximizing returns. Investors should control risks, avoid being forced to interrupt compounding due to market fluctuations, and choose investment portfolios that can be held for the long term. James emphasizes the importance of asset allocation, especially the role of cash, and the need to choose appropriate investment strategies based on different individuals (retired/not retired, different asset sizes).\nII. Briefing Content # The Most Important Thing in Investing: The goal of investing is to maximize the probability of success, not to maximize the rate of return. Risk management is to maximize the success of the investment portfolio and avoid interrupting compound growth due to being forced to sell because of market fluctuations. Good investment assets must be able to withstand fear and panic. The best investment strategies are those that do not create fear and panic. Sufficient cash is the best asset to help you sleep well and survive a sharp market decline. Risks of Stock Pledging: Stock pledging can easily lead to bankruptcy if asset allocation is not done properly. Do not try stock pledging lightly if you do not understand the operating principles of stock pledging, otherwise, you will most likely go bankrupt. Most people do not need to do stock pledging. Good asset allocation can make you rich without pledging. Asset Allocation for Different Individuals: Individuals who are not retired and have salary income: Refer to the article \u0026ldquo;Asset Allocation for Those Who Are Still Some Time Away from Retirement\u0026rdquo;, with QQQ as the main investment. Individuals who are retired and have no income: Refer to the article \u0026ldquo;Asset Allocation for Those Who Are Retired and Have No Income\u0026rdquo;, and choose QQQ, SPY, or high-dividend ETFs for allocation based on asset size, and consider the withdrawal rate. Investment and Life Philosophy: Investing is like life. It requires continuous learning and experiencing different stages to find an investment strategy that suits you. Resist temptation, avoid chasing short-term hotspots, and adhere to long-term investment. A-share Market Volatility: The A-share market has recently experienced a surge and a plunge, with many investors being trapped due to chasing hotspots. Market fluctuations are normal, especially in emerging markets. Investors need to be rational and adhere to long-term investment strategies. The Chinese government\u0026rsquo;s cooling measures are aimed at preventing further expansion of the bubble and protecting the interests of investors. Beware of Pump and Dump Schemes: Some online groups and \u0026ldquo;teachers\u0026rdquo; use market forecasts and insider information to induce investors to make trades and profit from them. Be wary of these pump and dump schemes. The futures market, due to its smaller scale, is more susceptible to manipulation. Be wary of pump and dump schemes in the futures market as well. CLEC Investment and Financial Management Channel Update Plan: Due to the time-consuming nature of producing short videos and the low viewership, we plan to stop updating short videos. The content of the produced short videos will be condensed into a briefing format and shared with you on Saturdays for discussion. It is recommended that you listen to long videos several times or listen to them in segments to achieve the same learning effect. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Ethan:\nSharing: In China, a similar effect to stock pledging can be achieved through the margin financing function of securities firms. Sharing: The A-share market has recently experienced drastic fluctuations, and many investors have been influenced by the media to chase hotspots, resulting in heavy losses. Viewpoint: If you don\u0026rsquo;t have the right understanding of the stock market, you are the victim. Jackie:\nSharing: Her personal journey of investing in the Nasdaq, from skepticism to firm holding, and finally overcoming psychological barriers to achieve \u0026ldquo;buy whenever you have money\u0026rdquo;. H:\nSharing: Followed recommendations for meme stocks in 2021, resulting in heavy losses. Started gradually transferring funds to QQQ in 2023 and using leverage. Question: The current proportions of QQQ, QLD, and SGOV have deviated from the initial 70%, 20%, and 10%. Is rebalancing needed? How should it be rebalanced? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: It is recommended to adopt a smart rebalancing strategy. Transfer 30% of the QLD profits to SGOV. When the market falls, transfer 2% of the total assets in cash to QLD. Im:\nSharing: Uses the mural story of Journey to the West as an analogy for the different stages of investment, reminding investors not to chase short-term gains and to adhere to long-term investment and continuous learning. Question: How to persuade people who spend extravagantly to develop the habit of saving? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: You can introduce them to the concept of long-term investment in index funds and the power of compound growth. Provide help within your means. Question: If you also have the habit of spending extravagantly, how do you control it? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Live within your means. As your wealth grows, it is normal for your living standards to gradually improve within the scope of risk control, but avoid excessive consumption and spending beyond your means. Sunny:\nSharing: The CLEC course not only teaches investment knowledge but also conveys life philosophy, helping everyone maintain a stable mindset in life and work. Viewpoint: People with stable emotions are the most valuable. Investing in QQQ also brings peace of mind. Beisen:\nBackground: Assets of 70 million, monthly mortgage payment of 125,000. Question: How to allocate assets to achieve early retirement? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Based on the current assets and expenses, immediate retirement is not possible. It is recommended to try the SPY asset allocation strategy, or use part of the funds to invest in high-dividend ETFs, and control the withdrawal rate. Kevin:\nQuestion: Why has Tesla fallen so much? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Investing in individual stocks requires understanding the company better than the CEO to grasp the ups and downs of the stock price. If you don\u0026rsquo;t understand Tesla\u0026rsquo;s business model, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t invest in it. Question: If you are very confident in Tesla, can you hold it for the long term? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: If you truly understand and are optimistic about Tesla, you can hold it for the long term, but you must manage risks well. Question: Does the teacher think the stock market will fall to zero? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: \u0026ldquo;Falling to zero\u0026rdquo; is a figure of speech, which means that even if the stock does not completely fall to zero, it will not be able to be realized if it falls to a certain level, and cash is needed to maintain life. Ming:\nSharing: I have invested in individual stocks before, and they all ended up going to zero in the end, so now I want to learn how to invest in index ETFs. Background: Total assets of 3.3 million, of which 2 million are in a brokerage account, 300,000 are in a Roth account, and 1 million are in a traditional IRA account. About to retire. Question: How to allocate cash and index ETFs? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: It is recommended to fully invest the brokerage account in SPY, the Roth account in TQQQ, and 60% of the traditional IRA account in money market funds and 40% in SPY. Question: How to withdraw funds after retirement? Do you sell even in a loss state? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: After retirement, you can withdraw 3% of your total assets for living expenses. You can sell SPY or obtain funds through stock pledging loans. You have to sell even in a loss state because you need cash to maintain your life. Question: Is the risk of investing in TQQQ in a Roth account too high? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: It is to maintain a certain cash ratio while obtaining relatively high returns. In extreme cases, you can transfer cash from the traditional IRA to the brokerage account or sell TQQQ to supplement cash. Question: How to transfer funds from a traditional IRA to a Roth account? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Transfer out a portion of the money every year and use loans or salary to pay taxes. Question: Why is the borrowing interest rate 5% and the cash interest rate only 2.5% when calculating interest in SPACE? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: This is just a conservative estimate. The yield of money market funds is usually lower than the borrowing interest rate. Sara:\nSharing: I have been investing in QQQ for three years and recently also invested in meme stocks. Question: I plan to borrow money to invest. Should I buy QLD? How should cash be allocated? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Based on Sara\u0026rsquo;s questions, it can be seen that she does not understand the concepts of stock pledging, leveraged ETFs, and asset allocation. Borrowing money to invest is not recommended. It is recommended to continue holding the 80% QQQ + 20% cash portfolio, and cash can be invested in BOXS. Tom:\nQuestion: How to maintain the cash ratio and avoid excessive tax rates in the case of long-term borrowing to live? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Leveraged ETFs and cash should be placed in retirement accounts as much as possible. Borrowing from a brokerage account should not exceed 70% of the account assets. Invest Roth IRA in TQQQ and hold cash in a traditional IRA. In extreme cases, the cash in the traditional IRA can be transferred to the brokerage account or TQQQ can be sold to supplement cash. The borrowing amount should be controlled within a certain range, for example, not exceeding 2% of the total assets per year. Taxes incurred by transferring a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA can be paid with loans or salary. Question: Why is the borrowing interest rate 5% while the cash interest rate is only calculated as 2.5% in SPACE? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: This is just a conservative estimate. Money market fund yields are usually lower than borrowing rates. Question: How to handle it if funds in the Brokerage account need to be used before retirement? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: You can use the funds in the Brokerage account for a pledge loan, but you need sufficient cash as a guarantee. Question: What if the cash in the Brokerage account is insufficient to cover the loan in the event of an extreme stock market decline? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: In extreme cases, you can transfer the cash in the Roth or Traditional IRA account to the Brokerage account, but this is an emergency measure and will incur penalties. Question: Is investing TQQQ in a Roth IRA too risky? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Investing Roth IRA in TQQQ is to obtain higher returns while ensuring a certain cash ratio. If you are concerned about risks, you can appropriately reduce the proportion of TQQQ and increase the proportion of money market funds. Question: In the long run, will borrowing from a Brokerage account lead to paying high taxes? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Borrowing itself does not increase the tax burden, but it can avoid the tax burden caused by selling stocks. However, if you transfer funds from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, it will increase your taxable income for the year and you will need to pay additional taxes. IV.

Summary # \u0026ldquo;Property of Money\u0026rdquo; is Korean entrepreneur Kim Seung-ho\u0026rsquo;s insightful account of his path to financial success. Starting from humble beginnings, he climbed the economic ladder, gaining profound insights into the multifaceted nature of money. Driven by a desire to share his valuable experiences, the book explores five key attributes of money and outlines four essential skills necessary for achieving wealth. Through compelling stories and real-life examples, Kim Seung-ho demystifies complex economic concepts and investment principles, offering readers a practical guide towards financial freedom.\nII. Chapter Summary # Part 1: The Essence of Money # Money is Personified: Kim personifies money, suggesting it possesses emotions and will. Your attitude towards money influences how it behaves towards you. Respect and treat it like a friend to earn its favor.\nInvesting in Superior Entrepreneurs: Investing in companies and entrepreneurs more competent than oneself is a wise move, akin to partnering with them and reaping the rewards of their success. The author shares how he invested in successful companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Nike, effectively becoming their \u0026ldquo;partner.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Secret of Compound Interest: Compound interest is a fundamental principle in investment, capable of multiplying wealth. However, one must also be wary of its power when applied to debt. The author uses Warren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Mona Lisa\u0026rdquo; analogy to illustrate the impact of compound interest.\nThe Strength of Fixed Income: Stable cash flow surpasses inconsistent income, attracting and accumulating wealth. Kim compares fixed income to a well-trained army, capable of efficiently managing a large-scale organization despite smaller numbers.\nMoney\u0026rsquo;s Gravitational Force: Substantial wealth attracts more wealth. Starting with small accumulations, compound interest propels wealth multiplication, much like the Earth formed from the gradual attraction of minuscule particles. The author illustrates this concept with the Han River and the Amazon River, demonstrating how small streams can converge to form vast rivers.\nHighest Risk, Lowest Risk: The stock market is riskiest when everyone is bullish and chasing the latest hot stock; conversely, it\u0026rsquo;s least risky when fear grips the market and everyone is selling. Maintain a balanced perspective on fear and greed, embracing opportunity during widespread fear and exercising caution when greed prevails. Warren Buffet\u0026rsquo;s famous quote, \u0026ldquo;Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,\u0026rdquo; encapsulates this wisdom. The author uses the example of increased airline safety a week after an accident to illustrate this point.\nTreat Others\u0026rsquo; Money as You Treat Your Own: Treating others\u0026rsquo; money with respect safeguards your own from similar disrespect. Respect for others\u0026rsquo; money is reciprocated. The author uses his attitude towards shopping carts at supermarkets to emphasize the importance of respecting others\u0026rsquo; money.\nInheriting Millions with a \u0026ldquo;No Loss\u0026rdquo; Clause: Through a hypothetical scenario, Kim highlights that preserving wealth is not straightforward. It requires learning, accumulating experience, and recognizing the significance of consistent income. The protagonist in the story inherits a substantial sum with the stipulation of no loss, ultimately realizing that maintaining wealth\u0026rsquo;s value is no easy feat.\nRejecting Quick Riches: The pursuit of quick wealth often leads to speculative traps and the perils of greed, ultimately ending in failure. Building wealth demands a steady and gradual approach. The author uses the analogy of constructing a house to demonstrate the importance of gradual wealth accumulation.\nCan Economists Predict the Future?: No one can accurately predict the macroeconomic future, especially in the long term, due to inherent uncertainties. Resist blindly following expert predictions; cultivate independent thinking and continuous learning. Kim quotes economist John Kenneth Galbraith: \u0026ldquo;There are two kinds of people in the world: those who don\u0026rsquo;t know and those who don\u0026rsquo;t know they don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo;\nBuying Samsung Stock at Samsung Securities: This anecdote illustrates the need for knowledge before venturing into investments. Avoid assumptions; understand market rules and investment tools. Kim compares the stock market to a ruthless jungle, where knowledge is essential for survival.\nChanging Your Destiny Through Respectful Address: A personal experience highlights the importance of respecting others and showing genuine interest in their affairs, leading to trust, goodwill, and ultimately, good fortune. The entrepreneur in the story habitually addresses everyone as \u0026ldquo;that person,\u0026rdquo; ultimately losing friends and connections.\nRepeated Luck is Skill, Repeated Failure is Habit: Lucky individuals often possess greater astuteness and intelligence. They excel at observation, learning, and accumulating experience. Conversely, repeated failure calls for introspection and addressing personal shortcomings. The author uses examples like lottery tickets, rock-paper-scissors, and parking spots to illustrate the interplay of luck and skill.\nDiscerning Fact from Investment Hype in News: Using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example, Kim underlines the importance of focusing on facts and data, rather than blindly trusting media reports and expert predictions. He reached a more accurate assessment by comparing the total number of infections with the infection rate.\nEach Dollar Experiences Time Differently: Borrowing Einstein\u0026rsquo;s theory of relativity, the author suggests that money is also subject to the influence of time. Different sources of money experience time differently; always invest with money that has ample time. Kim compares \u0026ldquo;time-rich\u0026rdquo; money to individuals who have more time to build relationships, fall in love, and raise children.\nDiversification Isn\u0026rsquo;t Enough: Kim critiques the misinterpretation of the saying \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t put all your eggs in one basket.\u0026rdquo; Diversifying within a single market is merely using multiple baskets on the same shelf, still exposed to risk. He recommends spreading investments across diverse markets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate.\nThree Paths to Wealth: The author outlines three ways to become wealthy: inheritance, winning the lottery, and business success. He encourages young people to pursue entrepreneurship or engage in long-term investment. Kim elaborates on two paths to business success: starting a business or investing in successful companies.\nWhy Savings Don\u0026rsquo;t Grow: The root causes of stagnant savings lie in spending future income, neglecting asset management, undervaluing small amounts of money, and lacking investment knowledge. The author advises readers to ditch credit cards, use debit cards, and appreciate the power of accumulating small amounts of money.\nPart 2: The Wisdom of Investment # Identifying Financial Illiteracy: Kim presents a list of 90+ economic and financial terms, encouraging readers to study and master this foundational knowledge, enhancing their financial literacy. He believes financial literacy is a vital survival skill for modern individuals.\nTraits of Successful Stock Market Investors: These individuals perceive themselves as business owners, hold high-quality money, and excel at buying at low prices. The author emphasizes selecting quality company stocks for long-term holding, engaging with the company\u0026rsquo;s progress as if they were owners.\nDefining True Wealth: Genuine wealth encompasses owning a mortgage-free home, a steady stream of passive income, and the mentality of \u0026ldquo;not needing to work.\u0026rdquo; Kim recognizes that the standard of wealth is relative, and true wealth lies in inner freedom.\nDaily Habits for Wealth Protection: The author shares his routine of diligently reading news, scanning economic websites, and collecting information. He believes continuous learning and market awareness are crucial for maintaining investment sensitivity and making informed decisions.\nThe Harsh Realities of Poverty: Drawing from personal experience, Kim paints a grim picture of poverty, encouraging readers to believe in their potential for wealth. He underscores poverty\u0026rsquo;s power to strip dignity and even dismantle family relationships.\nThree Responses to Financial Panic: The author categorizes people\u0026rsquo;s responses to financial panics: those who suffer losses, those unaffected, and those who capitalize and profit. He analyzes the characteristics of each group, noting that individuals with no debt and stable income weather the storm while those who seize opportunities emerge wealthier.\nRewinding Time for Wealth: Reflecting on his experience, Kim encourages young people to start investing early and highlights the limitations of relying solely on bank savings. He suggests young people focus on long-term investments in quality company stocks instead of traditional bank savings.\nThe Foundation of Wisdom: Learning fundamental knowledge is a prerequisite for gaining wisdom. The author encourages young people to study languages and mathematics, cultivating logical thinking abilities. He believes learning new languages broadens horizons while studying mathematics sharpens logical reasoning.\nImmediate Action for Wealth: Drawing inspiration from Marie Kondo\u0026rsquo;s organizational methods, Kim recommends readers declutter their homes, fostering respect for possessions, and reflecting on their spending habits. He suggests that the way we treat possessions reflects our attitude towards money; respecting belongings leads to cherishing wealth.\nWill the Stock Market Rise?: Don\u0026rsquo;t obsess over short-term market fluctuations. Focus on long-term investment, select quality companies, and patiently wait for value to return. He advises readers to identify quality companies that warrant long-term investment and maintain unwavering confidence.\nUnlocking the Value of Rent Payments: Entrepreneurs consistently paying rent possess the capacity to purchase property. The author encourages them to become property owners and capitalize on the potential for greater returns. He emphasizes that rental income can translate into property appreciation, while property ownership offers greater security and returns.\nReal Estate vs. Stock Market: Instead of fixating on which market is superior, choose an investment approach aligned with your style and risk tolerance. Kim provides a comparative analysis of real estate and stock market investments, highlighting their unique features and potential risks.\nMy Independence Day: Using the concept of a personal \u0026ldquo;independence day\u0026rdquo; marked by financial independence, the author emphasizes the significance of economic self-reliance. He encourages readers to develop financial strategies and strive for early financial freedom, recognizing its role as a foundation for personal liberty.\nFour Skills of Money Management: Kim outlines four essential skills for managing money: earning, saving, preserving, and spending. He provides insights into the characteristics of each skill and recommends learning methods. He emphasizes that these are interconnected skills that need to be mastered for effective wealth management.\nInvesting with Values: The author shares his investment principles, avoiding industries that profit from misfortunes. He believes such money carries negative consequences and clashes with his values. He exemplifies this with businesses centered around firearms, cigarettes, and drugs.\nInsurance is not Savings: Kim criticizes the practice of insurance companies selling high-commission, low-return products disguised as savings. He advises readers to choose insurance primarily for its protection function, not as investment vehicles, and to select suitable products based on their individual needs.\nBeautiful Junk: Drawing from a luxurious travel experience, Kim conveys that experiences and memories are more valuable than material possessions. He urges readers to avoid accumulating \u0026ldquo;beautiful junk,\u0026rdquo; recognizing that many purchases become unused clutter, wasting both money and space.\nSeparating Economics from Political Bias: Readers are urged to approach economic news with a critical eye, avoiding interpretation solely from a political standpoint. Refer to factual data to form judgments. Kim suggests that many media reports are politically charged, encouraging independent thinking and caution against being swayed by media biases.\nPart 4: The Mindset and Responsibilities of the Wealthy # The Underdog Advantage: Using historical and business examples, the author illustrates that underdogs overcoming giants is a recurring theme. He encourages young people to embrace challenges and strive for success. He believes individuals from humble backgrounds often possess greater drive and innovation, enabling them to seize opportunities and achieve upward mobility. Your Personal PER: Kim introduces the concept of Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PER) and applies it to personal careers and businesses, reminding readers to focus on the stability and sustainability of income sources. He emphasizes that high income doesn\u0026rsquo;t equate to wealth; building systems that generate consistent income is crucial. Wealth Is Not Predestined: Great wealth arises from a combination of opportunities, hard work, intelligence, and luck, not from predetermined destiny. The author encourages readers to actively seek opportunities and prepare themselves, believing everyone holds the potential for success, provided they believe in themselves and strive diligently. Start Small, Dream Big: Young aspiring entrepreneurs are advised to gain experience and build connections by initially working in small companies. He believes small companies offer more opportunities for learning and practical experience, facilitating rapid growth. Perseverance is Power: The author emphasizes the importance of consistency and perseverance, advising readers to devote 100 days or three months to mastering a skill or forming a good habit. He believes persistence is key to success, as any skill requires continuous effort to achieve mastery. Limitless Business Opportunities: Kim encourages readers to think outside the box and be receptive to business opportunities. He shares his experience of launching a flower shop, demonstrating that opportunities are present in everyday life; a keen eye can unearth suitable ventures. Entrepreneurship: The Path to Freedom: Entrepreneurship is championed as the only profession offering genuine control over one\u0026rsquo;s destiny. The author encourages young people to pursue entrepreneurship, breaking free from the limitations of corporate employment. He highlights that entrepreneurship offers greater freedom, a sense of accomplishment, and the potential for significant wealth creation. Discerning the Nature of Money: Earn money of good character, avoiding ill-gotten gains from sources like gambling or fraud. Kim believes that good money brings blessings, while bad money carries misfortune, using examples of money obtained through gambling or fraud to illustrate the harmful effects of ill-gotten gains. Navigating Family Responsibilities as the Wealthiest Sibling: Kim shares guidance based on his own experience, recommending different strategies for supporting and caring for family members, depending on the scale of wealth. Under 100 Million Won: Prioritize women in the family who have contributed significantly but are often overlooked, such as sisters-in-law, along with nieces and nephews. Buy them gifts, cover family meal expenses, and provide regular financial support to parents. Avoid lending money to siblings for business ventures or assisting parents in upgrading their homes or cars. Under 500 Million Won: You can purchase a house or car for your parents, cover all their living expenses, and assist nieces and nephews with education costs. At this stage, you can offer measured support to siblings. Over 1 Billion Won: Actively help siblings escape poverty, select suitable siblings to participate in the management of family businesses, and lead the entire family to prosperity. The Right to Fail: Young people are encouraged to embrace challenges without fear of failure, viewing failure as a valuable learning opportunity. He believes failure is a precious life experience, making success more appreciated when achieved. Can Books Create Wealth?: Reading alone cannot make one wealthy; the key is to cultivate independent thinking and draw inspiration from books. He suggests reading with a discerning mind, applying what you learn to your own experiences. God\u0026rsquo;s Impartiality: God\u0026rsquo;s fairness lies in his non-intervention in earthly affairs. The author encourages readers to rely on their own efforts rather than placing their hope in divine intervention. He believes each individual is responsible for their own destiny and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t place their hopes solely on divine intervention. The Passionate Entrepreneur and His Furious Wife: A fictional story emphasizes the vital role of family harmony in business success, condemning the practice of prioritizing investments at the expense of family well-being. The story features an entrepreneur, Mr. Song, who runs a successful dessert shop and a barbecue restaurant. He pours all the profits back into developing new menu items and his research lab, leading to financial strain at home and his wife\u0026rsquo;s understandable frustration. Partnerships: A Delicate Dance: Kim outlines the conditions and considerations for successful partnerships, emphasizing the importance of respecting partners\u0026rsquo; money and drafting legally sound agreements. He believes that trust and respect are paramount in any partnership, and all aspects of the agreement should be clearly defined in writing to prevent future disputes. Stick to the Main Road: When investing in unfamiliar sectors, opt for companies that are industry leaders to mitigate risk. He compares investing in a leading company to navigating a well-defined road, reducing the risk of getting lost and generally offering greater security. The Quarter Rule: The author unveils his personal \u0026ldquo;Quarter Rule,\u0026rdquo; advocating for living expenses to be capped at one-quarter of one\u0026rsquo;s financial capacity. This strategy allows for enjoying life while maintaining a financial safety net. Prayers Alone Won\u0026rsquo;t Bring Riches: True wealth comes through hard work, wisdom, and seizing opportunities, not reliance on divine intervention or supernatural forces. While prayer might offer spiritual solace, it cannot replace action. Four Habits of Saving: Cultivate good habits early in life, starting with simple daily actions that lay a strong foundation for wealth accumulation. These habits are: stretching upon waking, making your bed, drinking a glass of water on an empty stomach each morning, and maintaining consistent sleep and wake times. III.

Summary # The central argument of the book is that financial success is less about IQ and more about how you behave. Author Morgan Housel argues that by understanding the common psychological pitfalls associated with money, we can make better decisions. He illustrates this through a series of compelling stories and case studies, shedding light on our financial decision-making process.\nII. Chapter Summaries # 1. No One\u0026rsquo;s Crazy\nPeople’s unique experiences shape their financial perspectives and actions, leading to seemingly irrational yet logically justifiable behaviors. For example, low-income individuals might be drawn to lotteries as their perceived only shot at a life-altering fortune. 2. Luck \u0026amp; Risk\nNothing is as good or as bad as it seems, as luck and risk play crucial roles in personal outcomes. Bill Gates getting into a high school with a computer was luck. His friend Kent Evans dying in a mountain climbing accident was risk. Recognizing the influence of luck and risk helps avoid over-attributing success or failure solely to personal effort or poor decisions. 3. Never Enough\nContentment is key in finance. The pursuit of \u0026ldquo;never enough\u0026rdquo; leads to a dangerous cycle of insatiable desire that can ultimately lead to ruin. Former McKinsey CEO Rajat Gupta and Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff are cited as examples of individuals who lost everything due to greed. 4. Confounding Compounding\nCompounding’s power lies in long-term accumulation, allowing even small gains to snowball into extraordinary results. Warren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s immense wealth is attributed not just to skilled investment but to 70 years of consistent investing, highlighting the power of time. 5. Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy\nGetting wealthy requires taking risks, while staying wealthy requires humility, frugality, and respecting the fleeting nature of good fortune. Trading legend Jesse Livermore, despite remarkable success, fell victim to overconfidence and excessive risk-taking, ultimately leading to bankruptcy and suicide. 6. Tails, You Win\nIn business and investing, \u0026ldquo;tail events\u0026rdquo; (rare, high-impact events) often disproportionately drive overall results. Walt Disney produced hundreds of films, but the success of a single one, Snow White, propelled his entire enterprise to unimaginable heights. 7. Freedom\nThe greatest dividend of wealth is the ability to control your time, offering the ultimate flexibility to pursue your passions and spend time with loved ones. 8. The Ferrari Fallacy\nPeople care less about your wealth than you think. Their attention is often directed towards their own desires and comparing themselves to you. 9. Wealth is What You Don\u0026rsquo;t See\nTrue wealth lies not in flashy possessions but in the unseen: financial security, flexibility, and the ability to make choices. 10. Save Money\nBuilding wealth hinges on your savings rate, which is driven by lifestyle choices and managing desires. 11. Reasonable \u0026gt; Rational\nIn financial decisions, making reasonable choices that you can stick with is often more effective than striving for absolute rationality. 12. Surprise!\nHistory is full of surprises, so relying solely on historical patterns to predict the future is unreliable. Recognizing the constant possibility of the unexpected is crucial. 13. Room for Error\nThe most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan: Building in a margin of safety is crucial. 14. You\u0026rsquo;ll Change\nOur goals, thoughts, and aspirations change over time. Acknowledging this is essential when making long-term financial plans. Avoid extreme financial goals, embracing the fluid nature of life. 15. Nothing\u0026rsquo;s Free\nEverything has a price. Success in investing comes with costs: volatility, fear, and uncertainty. Viewing these as fees for a valuable service rather than penalties to avoid helps navigate the emotional rollercoaster of investing. 16. No One\u0026rsquo;s Crazy (Reprise)\nAvoid blindly following financial advice from people with different circumstances and timelines than your own. 17. The Seduction of Pessimism\nPessimism often seems more intelligent and gains more attention, even though the world has generally improved significantly over time. 18. When You Believe Anything\nThe power of narratives shapes our beliefs. The more we want something to be true, the more likely we are to embrace narratives that inflate its likelihood, especially in high-risk, high-reward scenarios like investing. 19. Summary\nThis chapter provides a recap of the key principles and advice from previous chapters to guide sound financial decision-making. 20. Confessions\nThe author shares his own personal approach to money management, highlighting the importance of seeking financial independence and emphasizing long-term investing. Appendix: A Brief History of the American Consumer\nPost-WWII, the US deliberately engineered the American consumer through low-interest rates, consumer credit, and programs like the GI Bill, fostering a culture of consumption and economic growth. From the 1950s to the 1970s, income distribution remained relatively equitable, the debt was manageable, and confidence in a better future was high. The 1980s onwards witnessed growing income inequality. The aspirational lifestyles of a small group of prosperous individuals diverged drastically from those of the average person, fostering a culture of keeping up appearances, fueled by debt. The 2008 financial crisis, a culmination of a debt bubble, exposed the cracks in this system. Recent years have seen a rise in social unrest tied to income inequality, prompting individuals to question the current economic and social model. III.

Summary # This book reveals a financial secret that everyone can learn but is rarely taught in school: You don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a finance expert or a high-income earner to achieve financial freedom; prudent spending and rational investing are all it takes, even on a modest income.\nThe author, Andrew Hallam, is a high school English teacher who started investing at age 19 and became a millionaire by age 38. He distilled his years of investment experience and wisdom he garnered from numerous financial wizards into nine simple and actionable principles. Supported by factual cases and personal anecdotes, he guides readers step-by-step towards financial freedom.\nII. Chapter Summaries # Lesson One: Spend Like You Want to Grow Rich # Distinguish between \u0026ldquo;wants\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;needs\u0026rdquo;: Spend rationally, control unnecessary expenses, and avoid over-reliance on credit cards. Invest the money you save. Example: In his youth, the author lived an extremely frugal life to pay off his student loans as quickly as possible, succeeding within a year and subsequently investing all his income. How to buy a car for less: Opt for low-mileage, easy-to-resell used cars instead of blindly pursuing luxury vehicles. Example: The author purchased low-mileage used Japanese cars in his youth and sold them for the same or even higher price after a few years, turning a small profit. Buying a house: It\u0026rsquo;s not about the down payment, but the interest rate: Consider whether you can still afford the mortgage if the interest rate doubles to prevent financial strain due to rising rates. Start strong, don\u0026rsquo;t rely on a \u0026ldquo;rich dad\u0026rdquo;: Excessive financial support from parents can hinder a child\u0026rsquo;s ability to create wealth independently. Teach them financial knowledge and skills, letting them learn how to earn, save, and invest on their own. Example: Studies show that accountants who received financial assistance from their parents had 43% less average wealth than their self-made counterparts. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to live like a pauper, but spend like a millionaire: Frugality does not equate to a lower quality of life. It\u0026rsquo;s about investing the money you save, allowing it to work for you instead of the other way around. Lesson Two: Use the Greatest Investment Ally You Have # Leverage compound interest to accelerate wealth accumulation: The earlier you start investing, the longer the time horizon for compound interest to work its magic, leading to faster wealth growth. Example: Investing $45 per month for 40 years yields significantly higher returns than investing $800 per month for only 25 years. Buffett\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark Principle\u0026rdquo;: Invest early, just like Noah built the ark, don\u0026rsquo;t wait for the \u0026ldquo;flood\u0026rdquo; to arrive before taking action. What to do when you get paid: Keep track of your monthly expenses, calculate the amount available for investment, and transfer that money to your investment account on payday to avoid running out of funds at the end of the month. Example: A couple the author knew, both teachers, realized their wasteful spending habits after tracking their expenses for three months. They subsequently allocated more money to investment, tripling their investment amount within two years. The stock market doesn\u0026rsquo;t believe in tears, but it believes in time: In the long run, the stock market rises with corporate earnings growth. Therefore, be patient and don\u0026rsquo;t be intimidated by short-term market fluctuations. The author\u0026rsquo;s stock market investments from 1990 had increased tenfold by 2016. Example: Using Willy Wonka\u0026rsquo;s chocolate factory as an analogy, the author explains the fundamentals of stocks, share prices, dividends, and the stock market in a simple and engaging way, highlighting the substantial returns from long-term investment. Lesson Three: Small Fees Pack Big Punches # Index funds: the secret to effortless wealth generation: Index funds track a specific market index, holding all or most of the stocks in that index to achieve the same return as the market. Their advantages lie in low costs, risk diversification, and stable returns. \u0026ldquo;The Oracle of Omaha\u0026rdquo; buys index funds: Investment gurus like Warren Buffett, Paul Samuelson, and Daniel Kahneman all recommend index funds because they provide market-average returns at the lowest cost, outperforming the vast majority of actively managed funds over the long term. Example: Buffett suggests putting 90% of one\u0026rsquo;s funds into an ultra-low-cost S\u0026amp;P 500 index fund. 78% of active fund returns go to the advisors\u0026rsquo; pockets: The high fees (management fees, transaction costs, commissions, etc.) of actively managed funds will eat up most of the investors\u0026rsquo; gains. Generally, their returns underperform index funds over the long run. Example: The author\u0026rsquo;s wife could have earned an extra $20,000 if she had invested in index funds instead of actively managed funds, as recommended by her financial advisor, over the past five years. Don\u0026rsquo;t bother picking \u0026ldquo;top actively managed funds\u0026rdquo;: There is no reliable method to consistently pick actively managed funds that will outperform index funds. Even if a fund has a history of exceptional performance, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee future success. Their returns tend to revert to the average or lower in the long run. Example: Investors in Morningstar\u0026rsquo;s five-star-rated funds often experience lower long-term returns compared to index fund investors. \u0026ldquo;International citizens\u0026rdquo; should opt for index funds: Actively managed funds are significantly more expensive outside of the US. Therefore, \u0026ldquo;international citizens\u0026rdquo; should choose index funds to lower their investment costs. Lesson Four: Conquer the Enemy in the Mirror # Stay rational, earn 10% returns even in a bear market: Don\u0026rsquo;t let fear and greed dictate your investment decisions. Don\u0026rsquo;t panic sell in a falling market or chase rising prices in a bull market. Stick to regular investment and buy more cheap stocks in a bear market to achieve higher returns in the long run. Example: During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, investors who steadily invested in index funds at the lows ultimately reaped higher returns. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to time the market: No one can accurately predict short-term market trends; don\u0026rsquo;t try to beat the market by timing it. Market timing often causes you to miss the best investment opportunities, leading to lower investment returns. Earning 150%? Be wary of tech stocks: Don\u0026rsquo;t be fooled by high-growth, high-valuation stocks. Stock prices eventually revert to the level justified by corporate earnings. Blindly chasing hot stocks can easily lead to losing your entire investment. Example: The dot-com bubble burst in 1999, causing countless investors to suffer heavy losses. The author himself lost nearly half of his money due to investing in Nortel Networks stock. Falling stocks: a buying opportunity: A bear market is the best time to invest. Seize the opportunity to buy more cheap stocks when prices are low. In the long run, stocks rise with corporate earnings growth. Young people should be excited when stocks rebound: Young investors have more time to allow compound interest to work its magic. They should actually hope for market declines to buy more low-priced stocks. Over the long term, stocks bought at a discount offer higher returns. Lesson Five: Build Mountains of Money with a Responsible Portfolio # Buy bonds as insurance for your stocks: Bonds offer lower returns than stocks but have lower volatility, reducing the overall risk of your portfolio. They act as a buffer when the stock market falls. Short-term bonds: a safe haven for your money: Short-term bonds are less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and are more suitable as a \u0026ldquo;safety cushion\u0026rdquo; for your portfolio. Adjusting your portfolio to profit from market crashes: Determine the appropriate mix of stocks and bonds based on your age and risk tolerance. Rebalance your portfolio regularly (e.g., review it annually), selling bonds to buy stocks in a down market and selling stocks to buy bonds in a bull market. Example: Before the 2008 financial crisis, the author created a portfolio with a 35% bond allocation. During the downturn, he consistently increased his stock holdings. Consequently, he achieved higher returns when the market rebounded. \u0026ldquo;Globalize\u0026rdquo; your investment: Don\u0026rsquo;t limit yourself to the domestic market. Diversify your investments across the globe to further reduce risk and access a wider range of opportunities. \u0026ldquo;Lazy portfolio\u0026rdquo;: adjust once a year for annual returns: Allocate your portfolio equally between stocks and bonds, rebalance once a year. This simple strategy delivers impressive long-term returns without demanding excessive time or effort. Example: Following the \u0026ldquo;Lazy Portfolio\u0026rdquo; strategy allowed investors to achieve positive returns even during the 2008 financial crisis. Lesson Six: Sample a \u0026ldquo;Round-the-World\u0026rdquo; Ticket to Indexing # ETFs: Access Global Markets with One Account: Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a convenient way to invest in index funds. They are traded on stock exchanges like individual stocks and cover a wide array of global markets. How to buy ETFs?: The author details the steps involved in buying ETFs: opening a brokerage account, finding the ETF ticker symbol, determining the price per share, and setting the investment amount, etc. Limit orders vs. market orders: The author explains these two common ETF order types and recommends using limit orders to avoid losses due to price fluctuations. US Indexes: Strategic Allocation for Optimal Returns: For US investors, a portfolio split equally between a US stock market index, a global stock market index, and a US bond market index, with annual rebalancing, is recommended for stable long-term returns. Example: The author\u0026rsquo;s friend, Chris, following this approach, grew his portfolio by 73.09% in 10 years despite experiencing the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Canadian Indexes: Minimize Costs for Maximum Returns: Canadians can build a low-cost, diversified global portfolio using TD Bank\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;e-Series\u0026rdquo; index funds or ETFs. The author uses personal anecdotes to illustrate that Canadian financial advisors are more inclined to recommend actively managed funds while overlooking low-cost index funds. He uses the example of Air Force Technician, Felix, to demonstrate how investors can build a low-cost, diversified portfolio through TD\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;e-Series\u0026rdquo; index funds. UK Indexes: Avoid High Fees, Optimize your Portfolio: UK investors should be wary of high-fee index funds. Building a diversified portfolio using low-cost index funds or ETFs provided by Vanguard or iShares is recommended. The author cites Virgin Money as an example to demonstrate how high fees and tracking errors can significantly affect index fund returns. He then uses the case of software engineer, Paul, to illustrate how investors can utilize iShares and Vanguard ETFs to build a low-cost, diversified portfolio. Australian Indexes: Multi-Asset Portfolios, Lower Fees with Higher Investments: Australians can opt for Vanguard\u0026rsquo;s multi-asset LifeStrategy funds or utilize platforms like Stockspot and Ignition Wealth to build ETF portfolios. The author shares the story of Andy, a software developer, who uses the Nabtrade brokerage platform to buy ETFs and create a diversified index fund portfolio. Singapore indexes: Low cost, smart allocation: Singaporean investors should also be cautious of high-fee index funds. Building a diversified portfolio using low-cost ETFs offered by Vanguard is recommended, but it\u0026rsquo;s important to avoid ETFs traded on US exchanges to avert US estate taxes. The author utilizes the example of \u0026ldquo;Fundsupermart\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;S\u0026amp;P 500 index\u0026rdquo; fund to illustrate how high fees significantly impact long-term investment returns. He further uses the case of a professor couple to show how investors can construct a diversified portfolio using ETFs traded on Singaporean and Canadian exchanges, thus avoiding US estate taxes. Lesson Seven: No, You Don\u0026rsquo;t Have to Invest on Your Own # Why do index investors lag behind the index?: Many investors fall prey to their emotions, making irrational decisions during market fluctuations, or are swayed by investment predictions, ultimately hindering their returns. Example: Some investors panic sell during market downturns and chase rising prices in a bull market, resulting in returns far lower than the index itself. US Robo-Advisors: Let the Smart Investors \u0026ldquo;Win\u0026rdquo; Effortlessly: Robo-advisor platforms can help investors create and manage low-cost index fund portfolios, rebalancing them regularly, and preventing investors from damaging their accounts. Example: Vanguard\u0026rsquo;s Target Retirement Funds offer a one-stop solution at a very low cost, suitable for those who prefer a hands-off approach to investment. The author uses his wife as an example to highlight the advantages of Vanguard Target Retirement Funds: achieving positive returns even without investment knowledge. Vanguard\u0026rsquo;s Comprehensive Financial Advisory Services: Vanguard provides comprehensive financial planning services at a low cost, making it a good option for investors seeking professional advice. Investment Guidance Training Services: Mark Zoril of PlanVision offers training services that guide investors to open low-cost brokerage accounts and build their own index fund portfolios. Investment Enhancement Services: Scott Burns of AssetBuilder provides investment enhancement services, using Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA) index funds to help investors build a \u0026ldquo;Lazy Portfolio\u0026rdquo;. The author elaborates on DFA\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy: pursuing excess returns through small-cap and value stocks. Betterment, Rebalance IRA, SigFig, and Wealthfront: These companies also offer robo-advisory services, building and managing portfolios consisting of index funds or ETFs for investors. Canadian Robo-Advisors: Lower Cost and More Targeted: Robo-advisor platforms in Canada, such as WealthBar and Wealthsimple, offer lower-cost, personalized services, tailoring portfolios to suit client risk tolerance and investment goals. The author uses personal experiences to demonstrate that Canadian bank advisors still favor actively managed funds over low-cost index funds. Tangerine: Tangerine bank provides Canadian investors with a financial product that encompasses a diversified index fund portfolio. Low cost makes it suitable for those who prefer to invest small sums regularly. The author uses 19-year-old Katie as an example to show how young people can leverage Tangerine\u0026rsquo;s investment products for regular investing. WealthBar: WealthBar offers Canadian investors five portfolio management solutions and provides comprehensive financial planning based on their risk tolerance. UK Robo-Advisors: Diversified Index Fund Baskets: UK robo-advisor platforms, like Nutmeg, construct diverse index fund portfolios for investors, rebalancing regularly, although their fees are comparatively higher. Australian Robo-Advisors: Increasing Competition and Falling Fees: The Australian robo-advisor market is highly competitive with decreasing fees. Platforms like Stockspot and Ignition Wealth offer low-cost, personalized ETF portfolio management services. Singapore Robo-Advisors: Avoid \u0026ldquo;Suicidal\u0026rdquo; Asset Allocation: Singapore\u0026rsquo;s robo-advisory market is nascent. Investors should opt for companies that don\u0026rsquo;t utilize ETFs traded on US exchanges to avoid US estate tax liabilities. Lesson Eight: Peek Inside A Pilferer’s Playbook # Identifying Financial Advisors\u0026rsquo; Tricks: Financial advisors use various tactics to persuade investors to buy actively managed funds, such as claiming that \u0026ldquo;index funds are more dangerous during downturns\u0026rdquo; or that \u0026ldquo;index funds can only achieve average returns,\u0026rdquo; both of which are misleading. Examples: When the author and his friend sought advice from financial advisors, they were aggressively steered towards actively managed funds without mention of their high fees or lower returns. One advisor even claimed index funds were riskier and that actively managed funds were better suited for navigating bear markets. Index Fund Returns Outshine \u0026ldquo;Financial Elites\u0026rdquo;: Even seasoned investment professionals like pension fund managers struggle to beat index fund returns. Many pension funds have started shifting towards indexed investments, allocating a significant portion of their funds to index funds. Example: A study by US consulting firm FutureMetrics revealed that less than 30% of large corporate pension funds outperformed a diversified portfolio holding 60% S\u0026amp;P 500 index and 40% corporate bond index. Don\u0026rsquo;t Accidentally Become a \u0026ldquo;Second-Rate Investor\u0026rdquo;: Don\u0026rsquo;t be fooled by financial advisors\u0026rsquo; sales pitches. Trust the data and facts - index funds are the most reliable way to profit in the stock market. Advisors\u0026rsquo; interests are often at odds with those of their clients; they prioritize commission income over investor returns. Lesson Nine: Avoid Seduction # Stock Picking Scams: Do their stock recommendations really work?: Investment newsletter predictions are often inaccurate, and their recommended stocks are likely to lead to financial ruin. Their primary goal is to attract subscribers, not to help investors make money. Example: The author invested in stocks recommended by \u0026ldquo;The Gilder Technology Report\u0026rdquo; and suffered significant losses. The author of that report continues to publish similar reports, using the lure of high past returns to attract investors. Investing in Emerging Markets: Don\u0026rsquo;t be fooled by GDP: High economic growth does not necessarily translate into high stock market returns. Be cautious when investing in emerging markets. They are more volatile and risky, and their long-term returns may not surpass developed markets. Example: While China\u0026rsquo;s GDP grew rapidly from 2008 to 2016, its stock market performance was lackluster, with investors in a large-cap Chinese stock ETF experiencing a 30% loss. \u0026ldquo;Gold speculation\u0026rdquo;: It\u0026rsquo;s not investing: Gold has a low long-term return rate with high price volatility, making it unsuitable for long-term investment. \u0026ldquo;Gold speculators\u0026rdquo; attempt to profit from price differences by buying low and selling high, a risky strategy that cannot guarantee stable long-term returns. Example: $1 worth of gold purchased in 1801 would only be worth $73 in 2016, whereas a $1 investment in the US stock market during the same period would turn into $16.24 million. Investment Magazines: The Untold Truth: Investment magazines rely heavily on advertising revenue, leading them to cater to their advertisers rather than prioritize investors\u0026rsquo; needs. They often recommend high-fee actively managed funds while neglecting low-cost index funds. Example: In April 2009, \u0026ldquo;SmartMoney\u0026rdquo; magazine recommended bond funds and gold, ignoring the investment opportunity presented by low-priced stocks amidst the financial crisis. Hedge Funds: Picking the Pockets of the Rich: Hedge funds charge exorbitant fees and carry significant risks, with long-term returns that are often no better, and sometimes even worse, than index funds. Their reported performance is often skewed by \u0026ldquo;survivorship bias\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;backfill bias.\u0026rdquo; Example: Hedge funds struggle to achieve an average annual compounded return of even 1%. Only one out of the top 20 largest hedge funds has outperformed the S\u0026amp;P 500 index. Don\u0026rsquo;t buy currency-hedged ETFs: Currency-hedged ETFs aim to eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on investment returns. However, the hedging mechanism itself incurs costs, decreasing a portfolio\u0026rsquo;s returns. Example: Research indicates that non-currency-hedged ETFs generally outperform their currency-hedged counterparts over the long term. Don\u0026rsquo;t fall for smart beta funds: These hybrid funds fall somewhere between active and index funds, attempting to achieve excess returns with specific strategies. Their effectiveness is debated, and their fees are generally higher. Example: Studies show that the market capitalization growth of smart beta funds has been primarily due to valuation increases, not corporate earnings growth, suggesting potential decreases in future returns. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly buy into small-cap stocks: Small-cap stocks, those of smaller companies, offer high growth potential, but also carry higher risk. Investing in them requires careful consideration and risk tolerance; avoid chasing high returns blindly. III. Key Quotes # You don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a financial expert; even with a moderate income, you can achieve financial freedom through prudent spending and rational investing.\nThis encapsulates the core message of the book: financial management and investment are not exclusive to the wealthy; ordinary people can also achieve financial freedom through learning and practical application.\nTime is money.\nThis emphasizes that time is our most valuable asset. The earlier you start investing, the longer the time horizon for compound interest to work its magic, leading to faster wealth accumulation.\nA successful investor should follow two principles: the first is to never lose money and the second is to never forget the first principle.\nThis quote highlights the importance of risk management and capital preservation in investing.\nThe investor\u0026rsquo;s task is to focus on the horse, not the jockey.\nThis means that investors should prioritize a company\u0026rsquo;s intrinsic value over the fund manager\u0026rsquo;s individual ability. Over the long run, a company\u0026rsquo;s profitability is the most important factor determining its stock price.\nIf you plan to live off hamburgers for the rest of your life, but you don\u0026rsquo;t own any cattle, would you want beef prices to go up or down?\nBuffett used this analogy to illustrate that stocks represent ownership in a company. When share prices fall, long-term investors should view it as an opportunity to buy more shares.\nThe most insidious devil is the high cost associated with holding certain actively managed funds.\nThis quote emphasizes that investment costs are one of the most important factors affecting investment returns. Choosing low-cost index funds maximizes gains.\nHow much you can accumulate in your lifetime depends not on how much you can earn, but on how you invest. Money finds people more effectively than people find money. Let your money work for you, not the other way around.\nBuffett stresses the importance of investment and financial management, pointing out that wealth accumulation relies not only on income but also on how you manage and invest your money.\nToo much money can harm investment returns.\nThis seemingly paradoxical statement highlights a critical principle: avoid over-diversification and the blind pursuit of high returns. Concentrating your investments in a few high-quality assets and holding them for the long term often yields better results.\nIn stock investing, luck inevitably plays a role, but in the long run, good luck and bad luck offset each other. For sustained success, skills and sound principles are essential.\nThis emphasizes that the key to successful investing lies in mastering the correct investment philosophy and principles and adhering to them in the long term, rather than relying on luck.\nLet time and money work for you; you just need to sit back and wait for the results.\nThis emphasizes the power of long-term investment and compound interest. By choosing the right investment method and being patient, significant returns will follow.\nIV. Practical Implications # This book\u0026rsquo;s key takeaways include:\nDeveloping a sound financial mindset: Understand the importance of thrift, control unnecessary spending, and invest your savings. Mastering simple and effective investment methods: Learn to leverage compound interest, start investing early, choose low-cost index funds, and commit to long-term investments. Avoid being swayed by short-term market volatility. Avoiding common investment pitfalls: Be wary of financial advisors\u0026rsquo; sales tactics, don\u0026rsquo;t blindly trust investment predictions or stock recommendations, and avoid being lured by the promise of high returns. Developing financial independence: Learn basic financial knowledge and skills, don\u0026rsquo;t rely solely on financial advisors, and learn to make investment decisions independently.

Main Topic # The theme of this session is Embrace the New Bull Market and Invest Long-Term. James believes that the global monetary easing policy and the rapid development of AI technology herald the arrival of a new bull market. He advises everyone to invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ or 00662) and view market fluctuations with a long-term perspective.\nII. Content Summary # A new bull market is coming: The world has entered an era of loose monetary policy with the start of a rate cut cycle, which will drive the stock market up. This bull market may be a slow one but will continuously rise. Invest confidently in the Nasdaq 100 index fund: QQQ could increase by 50 times in the next 20 years, with an annualized return of over 20%, making it the best investment target. Individual stocks are unreliable: Individual stock investment is risky, and in the long run, almost all of them will disappear. They are very difficult to outperform the market in the long term.

Comparison of household asset allocation in the US and Taiwan: American families invest most of their assets in securities to create social value, while Taiwanese families prefer cash, insurance, and real estate, locking up funds in non-appreciating areas. Leveraging through stock pledges: Using stock pledges to borrow increases liquidity and allows for continued investment to enjoy the benefits of compound growth. With an understanding of asset allocation, the interest cost of borrowing can be almost negligible. Plan for retirement early: Young people are advised to invest in 00662, and retirees can choose 00646 (SPY) or 0056 according to their fund size. Emphasize family education: Parents should cultivate their children\u0026rsquo;s financial management concepts from an early age, guide them to make long-term investments, stay away from bad habits such as short-term speculation and gambling, and lead by example. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly trust high-yield investment products: Any investment product promising high returns may be a scam. It is important to understand its operating mechanism and learn to discern between true and false. The dangers of short-term trading: Short-term trading will miss the best investment opportunities. Long-term investment in index funds will yield more stable returns. The purpose of cash allocation: It is not for profit, but for dealing with emergencies like unemployment or a market crash. It is advisable to keep more than 10% of your assets in cash. III.

Main Topic # This episode primarily discusses proper investment philosophy, ways to avoid investment traps, and the implications of China\u0026rsquo;s latest economic policies for the global market. James emphasizes the importance of long-term investment in index funds, particularly QQQ, and reminds investors to maintain emotional control and not be swayed by market fluctuations. He uses specific examples and data to illustrate the concept of \u0026ldquo;borrow for consumption, invest for asset growth,\u0026rdquo; while also analyzing China\u0026rsquo;s recently introduced series of economic stimulus policies, believing them to be a positive signal for a global economic recovery.\nII. Briefing Content # Investment Philosophy: Emotions are the biggest enemy in investing. You need to avoid being influenced by news and information, stay rational, and refrain from chasing rising or falling markets. Investing requires a long-term perspective, aiming for a timeframe of 40 years or more. Warren Buffett acquired 99% of his wealth after the age of 50, demonstrating that patience is key to wealth creation. Choose investment targets that are consistently stable and provide high returns. Index funds are the best option, especially QQQ, which boasts a long-term annualized return of 14%. Adhere to the \u0026ldquo;never sell\u0026rdquo; strategy to allow assets to continue appreciating. Avoid selling stocks unless absolutely necessary. Scam Avoidance Guide: Be wary of various investment traps. Do not trust any projects that guarantee high returns, especially those that require you to sell existing assets for new investments. Do not readily believe any investment or financial management information received via phone, text messages, or online platforms. Any information involving bank accounts or government departments must be verified through official channels. Be cautious of aggressive sales tactics from financial institutions. Stick to your investment plan and avoid being lured by various fancy financial products. Regarding Real Estate Investment: James advises against homeownership for average working individuals, believing it turns them into \u0026ldquo;mortgage slaves\u0026rdquo; burdened with heavy loan pressure, hindering wealth accumulation. He advocates for a \u0026ldquo;rent instead of buy\u0026rdquo; approach, suggesting using a stock pledge loan to rent high-quality housing at lower interest rates, then investing the saved funds for higher returns. Consider purchasing real estate only when your assets reach a certain scale and you can comfortably afford the payment. New Trends in China\u0026rsquo;s Economy: The People\u0026rsquo;s Bank of China recently introduced a series of potent fiscal policies, including reserve requirement ratio and interest rate cuts, injecting funds into banks, and encouraging stock purchases, to stimulate economic growth. These policies will contribute positively to stabilizing China\u0026rsquo;s real estate market, boosting consumer confidence, and promoting global economic recovery. Investors should pay attention to developments in the Chinese market and seize new investment opportunities. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IM:\nSharing: Through conversations with individuals of different age groups, IM discovered that most people have insufficient awareness of long-term savings and are often constrained by mortgages and other factors. By comparing the returns of index funds in different countries and regions with those of fixed deposits and pensions, IM illustrated the advantages of long-term investment in index funds. INGYNYING:\nSharing: INGYNYING\u0026rsquo;s mother wanted to sell all her assets to purchase a house but, after persuasion, realized that this would lead to losing opportunities for asset appreciation. Many of INGYNYING\u0026rsquo;s friends are afraid of change, preferring to endure the hardships of their current situation rather than attempt new investment methods. Question: How to convince family members to accept new investment concepts? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Utilize data and case studies for illustration, such as comparing the long-term returns of fixed deposits and index funds, and sharing success stories of investors. It\u0026rsquo;s also important to respect family members\u0026rsquo; choices and refrain from forcing them to accept new ideas. Allen:\nQuestions: Should someone with assets worth 50 times their annual living expenses use their salary to pay for a car? How can a couple combine their stock accounts for collateral purposes? James\u0026rsquo; answer: It is recommended to utilize Tesla\u0026rsquo;s official website loan to purchase a vehicle, then use funds from a stock pledge loan to repay the car loan. Dedicate your salary entirely to investment. Couples can combine their accounts through a joint account for collateral, sharing the limit, while their accounts remain individually managed. Eric:\nQuestion: Eric\u0026rsquo;s mother is visiting the US and is concerned about medical expenses. How should this be handled? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Purchasing travel insurance is advised, but excessive worry is unnecessary. Most non-emergency situations can be treated back home. If encountering extremely high medical costs, attempting negotiation with the hospital or seeking alternative solutions is possible. Due to the specific circumstances of foreign nationality and lack of income, the hospital may choose not to pursue the medical expenses. Dean:\nSharing: Dean purchased a new car using Tesla\u0026rsquo;s website loan and a stock pledge loan, conserving a significant amount of capital. Learning about investing boosted Dean\u0026rsquo;s confidence to decline a high-paying job and choose to stay home with their child. Michael:\nQuestions: How to secure a loan from Tesla\u0026rsquo;s official website for a car purchase? Can funds from 401k or IRA accounts be used for collateral? What are the options if QQQ is not available in their company\u0026rsquo;s 401k plan? James\u0026rsquo; answer: To apply for a car loan through Tesla\u0026rsquo;s website, choose the desired model and configuration, click \u0026ldquo;Order Now\u0026rdquo;, and select \u0026ldquo;Finance\u0026rdquo;. Funds in retirement accounts cannot be used as collateral; it is recommended to transfer part of those funds to a brokerage account for collateral purposes. Alternative options include choosing an S\u0026amp;P 500 index fund or inquiring with the company about the possibility of Blockage Link to invest in QQQ. EVA:\nQuestion: As a single, middle-aged woman with limited savings, how to balance work and investment? Should selling the house be considered for investment purposes? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Continue working diligently while consistently making monthly investments. Even small amounts will accumulate over 8-9 years, reaching the threshold for collateral, allowing you to leverage and accelerate wealth growth. Selling a house for investment is an option but requires careful consideration based on personal circumstances. If renting is more cost-effective, choose to rent and allocate the funds to investments yielding higher returns. Jenny:\nQuestions: Any knowledge regarding the latest Roth SEP IRA policy? James\u0026rsquo; answer: The policy information is quite recent, and the accuracy of the $69,000 limit requires verification. Consulting with professionals like a financial advisor at Chase or Lisa is recommended. As it is a new product, not all institutions may offer it. Sharing: Jenny shared a personal experience of being scammed, reminding everyone to exercise caution and avoid trusting any investment information, particularly those spread through unofficial channels. Haoqing:\nSharing: Haoqing relayed the experiences of close friends falling victim to scams, lamenting that scam tactics are constantly evolving and are hard to guard against, even for highly educated individuals. Question: How can investment concepts be better conveyed to people around us to prevent them from being deceived? Is there a need to explain professional investment knowledge? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Avoid explaining intricate investment knowledge; simply emphasize the core principle of long-term investment in index funds. Excessive professional details may confuse them, making them more susceptible to being misled by other investment information and ultimately falling prey to scams. Jason:\nSharing: Recounted an NFT scam incident encountered on Clubhouse, warning everyone to be wary of risks in the cryptocurrency world. Expressed gratitude toward James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy for helping them avoid such traps. Amy:\nSharing: Amy shared personal encounters with scams, including impersonations of government departments and courier companies. She emphasized the importance of relying only on written communication and ignoring any investment information delivered through phone calls or text messages. Amy suggested that, when in doubt, contact official channels for clarification. Becky:\nSuggestion: Avoid answering calls from unfamiliar numbers, set up spam filters, and use a less important email address when necessary to share personal information to minimize the risk of scams. Mike:\nQuestion: What are your thoughts on China\u0026rsquo;s most recent economic policies? Are they sustainable? James\u0026rsquo; answer: The People\u0026rsquo;s Bank of China has introduced powerful policies that are having a positive impact on economic confidence. Investors should keep an eye on these developments. Although the policies appear to be heading in a positive direction, their sustainability remains to be seen. Julia:\nQuestion: Any updates on the Roth SEP IRA policy? Are there any financial institutions already offering related products? James\u0026rsquo; answer: The policy information is fairly new, and the $69,000 limit\u0026rsquo;s accuracy is debatable. Consulting with a professional is advised. Being a new product, not all institutions might offer it yet. IV. Noteworthy Points # “You have enough money when you have enough.\u0026quot; \u0026ndash; Many people\nMany individuals believe that having just enough to get by is sufficient. This is a mistaken notion, as money is never truly enough. True financial freedom lies in possessing the power of choice – going wherever you want, doing whatever you desire – instead of being constrained by finances.\n\u0026ldquo;Never borrow money for investments.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; Many people\nMany believe that borrowing for investment is unwise; however, this viewpoint is overly cautious. True investors, like Warren Buffett, skillfully leverage debt. Following the principle of \u0026ldquo;borrow for consumption, invest for asset growth\u0026rdquo;, the correct approach is to use borrowed money for expenses and personal money for investment. This enables rapid wealth accumulation.\n“All investment information received through phone calls, text messages, or online platforms is not trustworthy.” \u0026ndash; James\nNowadays, numerous scams operate through these channels. It\u0026rsquo;s crucial to exercise caution and avoid blindly believing any financial advice or information. Anything involving bank accounts or government departments must be verified through official sources. Additionally, seeking guidance from qualified professionals is essential.\n“Investment must be consistently stable over the long term, which is why index funds are the only viable option.\u0026quot; \u0026ndash; James\nWithin the complex investment landscape, index funds stand out as a few reliable options capable of offering consistent stability and high returns. Index funds are like living organisms; they will never die, whereas all individual stocks will eventually disappear within a century.

Topic of the Session # The session centered on the core principle of long-term investment strategies. James reiterated his investment philosophy: \u0026ldquo;Buy QQQ whenever you have money and hold it for the long term.\u0026rdquo; The discussion expanded to cover aspects like investment philosophy, risk management, and values, incorporating current events and questions from attendees. James also shared insights from legendary investors like Warren Buffett, encouraging attendees to cultivate a sound investment mindset.\nII. Briefing Highlights # Buying at the Dip vs. Buying When You Have Money: James cited research from ChatGPT, indicating that even with the ability to accurately predict and buy at market dips, the long-term returns differed minimally compared to simply buying when one has available funds. Over a 20-year period, the difference was merely 8%, translating to a difference in annualized returns of less than 0.2%. Hence, rather than expending time and effort predicting market bottoms, it\u0026rsquo;s more effective to seize opportunities and buy QQQ when you have the money. Risks of Leveraged Funds: Using the 2000 tech bubble as an example, James explained how leveraged funds can accelerate losses in bear markets, potentially leading to devastating financial setbacks, even bankruptcy. He simulated a scenario where an investor repeatedly buys more leveraged funds as the market declines, culminating in financial ruin. This served as a cautionary tale against the \u0026ldquo;buy the dip\u0026rdquo; strategy with leveraged funds, emphasizing the importance of risk management. Keys to Investment Success: James emphasized that the key to successful investment lies in overcoming human weaknesses. Maintaining a detached and \u0026ldquo;unfeeling\u0026rdquo; attitude towards invested capital and short-term market fluctuations is crucial for adhering to a long-term investment approach. Market Cycles: James stated he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t teach attendees about predicting market cycles or any trading techniques. He considers these unimportant and prone to misinterpretation and misapplication, potentially leading to increased risks. He advocated for a long-term investment strategy, likening it to riding a cable car, a smooth and steady ascent to the summit of financial success. Money and Values: Acknowledging that individuals have different values regarding money, James advised understanding and respecting diverse values, discouraging attempts to impose one\u0026rsquo;s own values upon others. He used the example shared by an attendee about a mother preferring a financial subsidy over a family trip to illustrate the diverse ways people assign value to things. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IIM:\nShared: A story about a deceased friend, leading to reflections on money and values, and expressing confusion about balancing personal values with those of others. Question 1: How to understand some people\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;frugality\u0026rdquo; with money while being \u0026ldquo;generous\u0026rdquo; towards their pets. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: People manage their finances differently based on what they consider important and valuable. What might be significant to one person may hold little value for another. Question 2: How to understand a mother who prioritizes money over a family trip? How to better understand the needs of others? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This mother might have certain unmet needs, possibly requiring material security before pursuing leisurely experiences. Understanding true needs involves offering more choices (e.g., money plus a trip). Avoid trying to change others\u0026rsquo; values; focus on understanding and respecting them. Brian:\nShared: Encountering a friend who suggested leveraging to purchase Nvidia stock, leading to questions about investment advice. Question: How to evaluate investment advice received from others? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The validity of investment advice depends on individual judgment and risk tolerance. It\u0026rsquo;s important to avoid blindly following the advice of others and to think independently. Iny:\nShared: Experiencing a sense of calm and reduced anxiety after adopting James\u0026rsquo;s investment approach. This newfound peace of mind allows for dedicating more time to important matters like family, and interestingly, focusing on work has led to increased income. Question: How to understand the phenomenon of increased income resulting from a dedicated focus on work? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This exemplifies the principle that altruism ultimately benefits oneself. By focusing on serving clients and enhancing product or service quality, one ultimately gains client recognition and rewards, leading to higher income and a sense of accomplishment. Haoqing:\nShared 1: An experience with check fraud, prompting concerns about bank security and the risks of using checks. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Banks do not verify the identity of check depositors. Checks present security vulnerabilities, making it advisable to use safer online banking and digital payment methods like Apple Pay. Shared 2: Thoughts on the decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia, attributing this to factors like US regulations, labor laws, and unions. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia are multifaceted issues stemming from a complex interplay of factors, including national policies, labor laws, and unions. While Asian countries might resort to suppressing labor rights and environmental regulations to gain a competitive edge, the US places a higher value on worker well-being and environmental protection. This divergence in values contributes to different developmental paths. Becky:\nShared: Based on personal experience working in a digital payment company, Becky recommended that everyone stop using checks due to inherent security risks. Digital payment methods offer greater security and convenience, with features such as spending alerts that enable prompt response and recovery in case of issues. Mike:\nShared: As a long-time follower of James, Mike witnessed the evolution of his investment philosophy, from initially holding 30% SPY to converting to 100% QQQ, and eventually incorporating leveraged funds. He also shared personal investment experiences, like selling NIO and allocating a portion of his portfolio to private market investments. Question 1: Is investing in Intel after its acquisition worthwhile? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: James advised against investing in large companies that are acquisitive. Acquisitions often lack efficiency, posing integration challenges and potentially hindering productivity. While acquiring smaller companies for technological advantages makes sense, acquiring large companies is akin to amassing a pile of scrap metal. Question 2: How to view the supply chain security concerns stemming from the US outsourcing 3C product manufacturing, citing examples like the BBB Call explosion and walkie-talkie incidents? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Espionage is ubiquitous, and supply chain security is just one facet of this broader issue. Governments might implant spy codes in chips and software for surveillance purposes. Explosions are a relatively rudimentary form of espionage; more sophisticated methods can be extremely difficult to detect and prevent. Question 3: Is it possible to offer advanced courses for more experienced attendees? He suggested using portfolio sharing as a means to differentiate attendees\u0026rsquo; learning progress. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: James stated he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t differentiate between attendees nor offer advanced courses. Assessing whether a student is genuinely learning is primarily based on their attitude, not investment returns or holding duration. Even portfolio sharing can\u0026rsquo;t truly gauge learning progress. James mentioned his personal sensitivity to words and language, enabling him to discern learning attitudes from attendees\u0026rsquo; emails and the way they pose questions. IV. Noteworthy Insights # The best time to buy is when you have money. \u0026ndash; James\nMany obsess over finding the perfect entry point, but research indicates that even if you could perfectly time market dips, the long-term returns barely differ from simply buying when funds are available. Instead of wasting time trying to predict the market, seize the opportunity and act promptly.\nTo succeed in investing, you must be indifferent to the money you invest and the fluctuations in stock prices. \u0026ndash; James\nOvercoming the human tendency to fixate on money and fear short-term market swings is essential for maintaining a long-term investment strategy and achieving stable returns.\nTo achieve effortless investing, you need to be numb to money. \u0026ndash; James\nWhen investing becomes a habit, free from emotional impulses and external distractions, you can achieve optimal results.\nThe concept of a \u0026ldquo;benefactor\u0026rdquo; is relative. \u0026ndash; James\nPeople perceive and absorb information differently. Who you consider a benefactor might not be perceived as such by others.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t try to change other people\u0026rsquo;s values. \u0026ndash; James\nEveryone has their own values and ways of life. It\u0026rsquo;s important to understand and respect diverse choices.\nEspionage is everywhere. \u0026ndash; James\nInformation security is a growing concern. Be vigilant and protect your personal data.\nAcquisitions of large companies are generally inefficient, and leaders who are fond of acquisitions usually have inflated egos. \u0026ndash; James\nIntegration complexities and high management costs associated with mergers often outweigh the benefits gained.\nThe US excels in areas such as finance and technology design, while Asian countries can only substitute and supplement in specific aspects. \u0026ndash; Haoqing\nWithin the global division of labor, different countries have distinct strengths and weaknesses, leading to divergent paths of development.\nThe best judgments are validated by facts. \u0026ndash; Mike\nThe success of an investment philosophy is ultimately determined by its long-term returns, not short-term fluctuations or gut feelings.\nYour attitude determines my response. \u0026ndash; James\nJames adjusts his responses based on the learning attitude of the attendees. Attendees who are truly dedicated to learning will receive greater guidance.\nInvesting in individual stocks will ultimately lead to bankruptcy; holding onto individual stocks will also ultimately lead to bankruptcy.\n\u0026ndash; James\nCompanies have lifecycles. Holding onto a single stock long term significantly increases the risk of encountering bankruptcy. Diversification is key in investing.\nV. Summary # This live session once again emphasized the importance of long-term investing while reminding attendees to stay rational, patient, and vigilant. James addressed attendees\u0026rsquo; questions regarding investment strategies, risk management, and the relationship between money and values, sharing personal experiences and insights. Key takeaways include avoiding market timing, leveraged funds, and individual stock investments, and embracing an attitude of indifference towards money. Attendees actively shared their own investment experiences and reflections, prompting deeper contemplation on investment, money, life, and more. The session also delved into the philosophies of renowned investors like Warren Buffett and discussed various social phenomena, creating a rich and informative experience.\nDisclaimer: This transcript serves as personal learning notes only and does not constitute investment advice.

Theme of the Episode # The theme of this episode is \u0026ldquo;Investing and Financial Management, Wealth is a Gift.\u0026rdquo; The core viewpoints are: Wealth is innate, but one must be informed to realize it; investing and financial management is an important way to accumulate wealth; index investing is an effective method to achieve long-term stable growth; rational asset allocation and risk control are the keys to investment success; and overcoming psychological barriers in investment and solidifying the long-term investment philosophy are crucial to ultimately achieving financial freedom.\nII. Summary of the Briefing # Wealth is a Gift: Wealth is innate, and being informed of this fact makes a huge difference. While successful entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are a minority, most people need to be told that \u0026ldquo;wealth is a gift,\u0026rdquo; and they need to learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth. The Power of Index Investing and Compound Interest: Index investing is an effective way to achieve long-term stable returns, and its compounding effect is astonishing. For example, investing $1,500 per month for 40 years with a 14% annualized return will yield $2.6 million. Even small amounts of money can accumulate considerable wealth through consistent long-term investment. High Risk, High Return?: High risk doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily lead to high returns. Whether you can bear the risk determines whether you can ultimately achieve high returns. Don\u0026rsquo;t overestimate your risk tolerance. Your risk appetite should be determined by an asset allocation that you can withstand even if your investment goes to zero. For example, if you cannot afford the risk of TQQQ going to zero, you should not invest in TQQQ. Choosing Investment Targets: It is recommended to invest in the global Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ). Those with insufficient funds or who are already retired can consider investing in SPY or high-dividend ETFs. Avoid investing in individual stocks because they tend to disappear over the long term, while index funds can continue to exist. The half-life of individual stocks is 10 years; out of 100 stocks, there may be less than three left after 50 years. Investment Mindset: The market will eventually rise, and investment requires patience. Always stay optimistic, even if the investment goes to zero. Learning about investing and financial management requires continuous thinking, like peeling an onion, layer by layer, to elevate the energy of the spiritual level. Investing is like the Yellow Mountain, eternally unchanging, yet different every day; every learning experience will bring new insights. Asset Allocation: Asset allocation is like building a house; it is a big project that requires comprehensive planning, not something simple. It is necessary to consider many factors, such as whether you are retired, your age, income, debt, and cash flow, to formulate a reasonable asset allocation plan. You need to carefully study the articles and videos on asset allocation provided by James to develop a plan that suits you. Do Not Blindly Trust External Information: Financial professionals often only consider their interests, so do not easily believe their advice. Think independently, study carefully, and do not be swayed by external information and noise. Most of the outside information is garbage; do not be affected by it, focus on learning James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy. Balancing Risk and Reward: Do not excessively pursue high returns or completely risk-free investments; balance risk and reward. Avoid changing investment strategies easily to prevent additional costs due to frequent trading. James\u0026rsquo; investment methods can guarantee asset appreciation and relative safety, avoiding extreme situations. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IM:\nSharing: Learning about investment is like peeling an onion; at first, the amount of information is overwhelming, but as you learn more, you will gradually understand the core idea and ultimately reach the realm of \u0026ldquo;the great Dao is simple.\u0026rdquo;\nQuestion 1: What do you think about the idea that \u0026ldquo;investing is simple\u0026rdquo;?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: Such views often mistake ignorance for inaction and do not truly understand the complexity and risks of investment. Question 2: How should we communicate with friends who don\u0026rsquo;t understand index investing?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: You can start by briefly introducing the concept and advantages of index investing and suggest that they watch related videos to learn. Don\u0026rsquo;t force them to accept it, everyone has their own choices. Just like preaching, we can only try our best to spread the message; whether it\u0026rsquo;s ultimately accepted depends on the individual. LAN:\nQuestion 1: How to calculate Beta? What is the actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: You can refer to the link to the article on Beta calculation on the message board. The actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF may deviate from the theoretical value due to factors such as market volatility and friction costs. When market volatility is large, the wear and tear of leveraged ETFs will be more serious, resulting in an actual Beta value lower than the theoretical value. Question 2: Why is there a huge difference in final return between scenario 3 and scenario 4.1 in the 005 topic?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: Scenario 4.1 is where no money is withdrawn from the investment, so the final return will be higher. Question 3: How to adjust Beta in a rising market?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: The adjustment of Beta should be determined by your own risk tolerance, not by the market trend. Do not try to predict the market, just keep a fixed Beta value. Question 4: For investments in Taiwan, should I choose Q2D or 00670L?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: 00670L is recommended because it includes New Taiwan dollar hedging, which can reduce the risk caused by exchange rate fluctuations. Don\u0026rsquo;t change investment targets frequently, choose one that suits you and hold it for the long term. Nai Xin:\nSharing: Wealth is a gift, just as self-confidence is a gift; everyone has potential, but it needs to be stimulated. The key to investing and financial management lies in learning. Once you have mastered the correct investment method, you can focus on your own career and life and let wealth grow naturally over time. Overcome fear, build confidence, and you can realize your potential, gain wealth, and achieve success. Jason:\nSharing: Understanding \u0026ldquo;buy whenever you have money,\u0026rdquo; but still finding it difficult to overcome psychological fluctuations when the market rises or falls sharply. James\u0026rsquo; Response: Overcoming psychological fluctuations takes time and experience. You can try to make a small number of trades, experience the impact of market fluctuations, and gradually adapt to market changes. IM Supplement: You can overcome psychological barriers by imagining starting to invest two years later and understanding that \u0026ldquo;money arrives at different points in time.\u0026rdquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about buying at the lowest point; as long as you stick to long-term investment, you can get good returns. Hai Rui Ji:\nSharing:\nThank you James for selflessly sharing your investment philosophy; students learn from each other and make progress together. James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy requires continuous learning and understanding to grasp it fully. \u0026ldquo;Never sell\u0026rdquo; does not mean you cannot sell, but that you should develop a reasonable investment strategy based on your own situation. ** \u0026ldquo;Never sell\u0026rdquo; refers to mentally ignoring market fluctuations and adhering to a long-term investment philosophy.** Investment philosophy needs to keep pace with the times and adjust investment strategies according to changes in the environment. Question: Already answered in the video.\nLi Zi:\nSharing: To overcome psychological barriers to investment, manage accounts separately, using one part for long-term investment and the other for tentative operations, such as selling covered calls. This satisfies the desire to trade and avoids losses due to frequent trading. James\u0026rsquo; Response: You only know what is best after you have experienced it. Experience in trading can lead to a firmer commitment to a long-term investment strategy. Trying different trading strategies can help you understand the advantages of long-term investment and ultimately achieve the state of \u0026ldquo;daily reduction for the Dao.\u0026rdquo; T:\nQuestion 1: Why has the capital market in mainland China performed poorly for a long time?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: Emerging markets take time to mature. The Chinese market is like the Taiwanese market 50 years ago. It has the potential to rise in the long term, but its return may be lower than that of the US market. Investment should focus on sustainable development markets. The US market has advantages in terms of systems and industries. Question 2: Under foreign exchange control, how do I invest in US index funds? Are there any risks?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: You can invest by purchasing ETFs listed in China that track US index funds, such as 513100. Foreign exchange controls mainly restrict the physical flow of funds, and buying ETFs is not restricted. The current scale of such investment is small and will not trigger a quota limit. Even with foreign exchange control, it is still possible to allocate global assets through legal channels. IV. Key Takeaways # Wealth is a Gift \u0026ndash; James\nEveryone has the potential for wealth, but they must be informed to realize it and learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth.\nLearning Increases Daily, the Dao Decreases Daily \u0026ndash; IM\nLearning about investing and financial management is a process of continuous improvement.

During the Q\u0026amp;A session, students actively questioned their own issues and confusions. James patiently and meticulously answered them by combining practical cases and his own experience, helping the students better understand and master the knowledge and methods of investing and financial management.

Main Topic # This session focused on the nature of capitalism and a brainless investment strategy. James criticized the current financial education system for \u0026ldquo;enslaving\u0026rdquo; the masses, arguing that it\u0026rsquo;s designed to create workers, not capitalists. He stressed the importance of asset allocation and understanding the true meaning of wealth to achieve financial freedom in a capitalist society.\nII. Briefing Content # The Essence of Capitalism: James likened capitalism to a massive AI, with complex and opaque operating mechanisms that can easily lead to confusion. He argued that capitalism is not inherently evil but a tool, the key being the user\u0026rsquo;s mindset and approach. Similar to the emergence of AI, capitalism also evolved from simple buy-and-sell relationships, its complexity making it difficult to predict and understand. Brainless Investing Strategy: \u0026ldquo;Buy when you have money, and never sell.\u0026rdquo; He emphasized index fund investing, particularly the Nasdaq-100 index fund (QQQ), as the core investment vehicle. He opposed over-diversification, believing that focusing on the US market is more effective due to its fairness, justice, and openness. The Importance of Asset Allocation: Asset allocation is the core of investing, and it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to develop a suitable strategy based on individual circumstances. James provided relevant links and video resources to help the audience learn more. A safe and sound asset allocation should be able to cope with market fluctuations, ensuring that even if the market drops to zero, one can still maintain their lifestyle for many years. He highlighted the concept of \u0026ldquo;being able to live comfortably for over a decade regardless of market fluctuations.\u0026rdquo; The True Meaning of Financial Freedom: True financial freedom is not just about possessing wealth but also about \u0026ldquo;knowing how to spend.\u0026rdquo; This means understanding one\u0026rsquo;s asset situation and knowing how much can be freely spent annually and monthly. He emphasized the concept of \u0026ldquo;knowing what to spend and spending it freely when desired.\u0026rdquo; Parenting and Responsibility: He encouraged young people to have children and cultivate their sense of responsibility and financial awareness from a young age, enabling them to be self-reliant. He shared his experience of educating his daughter, emphasizing the importance of letting children bear the consequences of their actions, starting with small things. The Meaning of Learning: The purpose of learning is not just for monetary gain but for ultimate enlightenment. One should absorb knowledge like a sponge, cultivate thinking abilities, and ultimately reach the state of \u0026ldquo;decreasing knowledge to gain wisdom.\u0026rdquo; He used the example of martial arts manuals to illustrate that learning is a process from having something to having nothing. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # YJ:\nSharing: Discussed the lack of financial education in Asia, using the moon analogy to illustrate the differences between Eastern and Western education. Mentioned the inspirational Jewish financial education book, Talmud. Question: How to educate children about finances from a young age. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Cultivate children\u0026rsquo;s sense of responsibility from an early age, let them understand the meaning of wealth, and encourage them to start financial planning and investment early. Avoid the negative views on money held by older generations. Ying Nuo:\nSharing: Shared the enlightenment gained after learning James\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy and how they implemented a simple asset allocation strategy, feeling secure and stable. Question: Question about the pledging ratio. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Corrected the concept of the pledging ratio, emphasizing that retirees should pledge or borrow 2% of their total assets for living expenses, and young people should choose QQQ for better growth potential. IM:\nSharing: Shared the simplicity and convenience of ETF investing, along with experiences sharing investment philosophies with friends and their views on having children. Question: Whether one should \u0026ldquo;know too much\u0026rdquo; in investing and life, and whether concerns about the future and AI would affect the willingness to have children. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Affirmed the importance of learning, but emphasized the need to learn to subtract, filtering out unimportant knowledge and information. \u0026ldquo;Gaining knowledge daily, losing wisdom daily.\u0026rdquo; Encouraged young people not to be afraid of having children, sharing his understanding of the meaning of life - \u0026ldquo;The meaning of life lies in creating the next generation of life in the universe.\u0026rdquo; Chang An:\nSharing: Shared news about a government department in China buying Nasdaq funds and becoming the largest shareholder. Question: The implications of this action and its connection to US-China relations. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Affirmed the investment behavior of the government department, believing it to be the correct way to manage finances, and encouraged other government departments to learn from it. He believed that governments should also engage in asset allocation. Sam:\nSharing: Shared entrepreneurial experiences and reflections on blind expansion, as well as personal confusion about retirement and future life. Question: Preparing for retirement but feeling lost about the future state of life and unsure how to prepare. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Retirement is not the only option, listen to your inner voice, and find a lifestyle that makes you happy. Don\u0026rsquo;t over-plan the future; things will work out. He also suggested that Sam think about streamlining company processes, improving efficiency, and making employees happier at work. Jason:\nSharing: Examples of young people staying at home after graduating from university. Question: How to help young people find meaning in life. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Cultivate children\u0026rsquo;s sense of responsibility from an early age and let them learn to be self-reliant. Parents should not over-pamper their children, let them take responsibility, and encourage them to enter society and serve others. He used his own daughter as an example to illustrate how to cultivate children\u0026rsquo;s sense of responsibility from a young age. IV. Key Takeaways # Spending money is moral. \u0026ndash; James\nSpending money should not be seen as negative; knowing how to spend and being willing to spend is the only way to truly enjoy the freedom that wealth brings. Also emphasized taking advantage of credit card benefits, points, etc.\nThe more we know, the greater the risks we don\u0026rsquo;t know. \u0026ndash; James\nAs our knowledge increases, we need to be more cautious in identifying and assessing potential unknown risks. The real risk is the unknown risk.\nThe class of those who know and those who don\u0026rsquo;t. \u0026ndash; James\nThere is a disparity in information and knowledge in capitalist society, leading to class differentiation between those who know and those who don\u0026rsquo;t. Wealth and capital are concentrated in the hands of a few.\nI may not know where I\u0026rsquo;m sailing, but I know there are some paths I can no longer take. \u0026ndash; Sam\nOn the road of life, clarifying what you don\u0026rsquo;t want is more important than knowing what you want.\nV. Conclusion # This session covered investment philosophy, life philosophy, parenting experiences, and more. James, with his unique perspective and sharp language, criticized the shortcomings of the current financial education system, proposed a \u0026ldquo;brainless investing\u0026rdquo; strategy, and emphasized the importance of asset allocation and \u0026ldquo;knowing how to spend.\u0026rdquo; He also discussed topics such as how to cultivate children\u0026rsquo;s sense of responsibility and finding one\u0026rsquo;s purpose in life, encouraging the audience to actively think about the meaning of life and contribute to society.\nDisclaimer: This article is only for personal learning notes and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Theme # This session centers around the importance of psychological resilience in investing. James\u0026rsquo;s core message is that mental strength is the key to investment success, while other skills and calculations are secondary. Investors need to maintain a highly optimistic mindset, viewing market fluctuations as opportunities rather than crises in the long run. Long-term investing, rational analysis, and maintaining a healthy mindset are more crucial than striving for precise calculations.\nII. Briefing Content # Correction on 401(k) and IRA: James corrects a statement from the previous session regarding 401(k) and IRA contribution limits, clarifying that the limits for each are independent, but that IRAs have income restrictions. He provides further explanations about the Backdoor Roth IRA conversion, advising listeners to manage pre-tax and after-tax funds carefully to avoid account confusion and complications during tax filing. Asset Allocation Strategy: He emphasizes the significance of asset allocation and suggests listeners refer to existing articles and Excel spreadsheets for simulations, discouraging impulsive decision-making. He offers various asset allocation plans catering to different risk tolerances and retirement stages, stressing the concept of \u0026ldquo;fuzzy accuracy\u0026rdquo; – that it is not necessary to pursue overly precise ratios, but ensuring sufficient cash reserves is crucial. Example: A listener proposes an allocation of 60% QQQ and 40% cash, which James believes carries a risk of bankruptcy and advises them to consult the provided asset allocation plans. Leveraged ETFs and Rebalancing: Using QQQ\u0026rsquo;s beta value of 1.0 as a benchmark, he simplifies beta calculations for leveraged ETFs, for instance, QLD is considered 2.0. He recommends a gradual approach when adjusting beta during rebalancing, advising against drastic changes. For investors with earned income, the frequency and ratio of rebalancing can be more flexible. Example: He suggests that young investors can rotate investments among QQQ, QLD, and TQQQ every six months, then rebalance at the end of the year. Long-Term Investing and Market Volatility: James reiterates the importance of long-term investing, using the dot-com bubble of 2000 as an example to demonstrate that long-term investors ultimately profit, even after enduring prolonged market downturns. Market dips are opportunities, and investors should remain optimistic, buying whenever they have funds available. He refutes the notion that \u0026ldquo;investments in 2000 took 15 years to break even,\u0026rdquo; emphasizing that the market always recovers in the long run. Example: An investment of $5 million at the peak of the market in 2000, despite experiencing the burst of the internet bubble, would still have grown to $32.375 million by 2024. Brokerage Selection: He advises choosing brokerages with physical branch offices and understanding how stocks and cash are held in custody to ensure asset security. Example: He explains the risks of nominee accounts and recommends selecting brokerages that allow for direct ownership of stocks, encouraging listeners to inquire about the brokerage\u0026rsquo;s custodian banks for stocks and cash. Purpose of Holding Cash: He underlines that cash holdings are meant for emergencies and to seize buying opportunities during market downturns, not for pursuing interest income. Example: He suggests maintaining a 20% cash position, a portion of which can be utilized for adding to leveraged ETFs during dips. Investment Target Selection: He recommends selecting suitable investment targets based on individual circumstances. For instance, retirees or individuals with limited funds may consider high-dividend ETFs, while younger individuals or those with ample funds should focus on growth-oriented ETFs like QQQ. Example: Addressing a listener holding SCH, James advises them to assess whether high-dividend ETFs are appropriate based on their asset level and annual expenses. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Danny:\nShares: He has been following James\u0026rsquo;s investment strategy for three years and achieved a return of approximately 35%. Chang\u0026rsquo;an:\nQuestion: Brokerage security and recommendations in Hong Kong. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Choose brokerages with physical branch offices in the region, understand the custodian banks for stocks and cash, and avoid easily dissolved online brokerages. Eric:\nShares: He began investing during the pandemic, experienced the hardships of short-term trading, and eventually recognized the importance of long-term investing and psychological control. He uses the example of Jesse Livermore to illustrate the risks of trading. Jessie:\nShares: Both she and her husband are nearing 60 years old, and a portion of their investment funds comes from a mortgage loan. She expresses concerns about a potential market crash and the risk of USD devaluation. Questions: How to cope with a possible future market crash, especially with a mortgage due before retirement? What about USD devaluation? Are there risks associated with concentrating large sums of money in a single brokerage account? Is it feasible to refinance the mortgage in five years or repay it early with funds from the investment account? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The market is unlikely to experience losses within a 15-year timeframe. Ensure you can comfortably handle mortgage payments for the next 13 years; the most secure approach is to sell the house and repay the loan. He declines to answer hypothetical questions. Stocks are registered under the investor\u0026rsquo;s name, hence the risk of brokerage failure is manageable. Refinancing or early repayment is not recommended. Excessive focus on short-term interest gains is akin to \u0026ldquo;penny wise, pound foolish,\u0026rdquo; and ultimately increases risk. Sam:\nShares: He went all-in on QQQ, but after some short-term trading, realized it wasn\u0026rsquo;t suitable for him and experienced psychological pressure due to large position fluctuations. Question: How to overcome the psychological pressure brought about by fluctuations in a large portfolio? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Focus on realized gains rather than unrealized gains. Maintain 20% cash and 20% leveraged ETFs to stabilize your mindset. Exercise caution with short-term trading, as it may not be sustainable in the long run. Haoqing:\nShares: He uses examples of friends gambling and raising children to illustrate the importance of moderate expectations and nurturing interests. He compares and contrasts education philosophies and Nobel Prize achievements between China and the US, emphasizing the significance of financial freedom for the next generation. IV. Highlights # Mental fortitude is the equipment for investing, it determines whether you will succeed. \u0026ndash; James\nInvestment skills and calculations are undoubtedly important, but psychological resilience is the ultimate factor that decides investment success. Even for simple index fund investing, a sound mental state is needed to navigate market volatility.\nA market downturn is not a disaster, it\u0026rsquo;s an opportunity. \u0026ndash; James\nFrom a long-term investment perspective, market downturns provide excellent opportunities to acquire high-quality assets. Maintain a long-term outlook and don\u0026rsquo;t be intimidated by short-term fluctuations.\nThere should be a limit to human pessimism. \u0026ndash; James\nExcessive pessimism and worry are detrimental to investments. One should rationally analyze risks and develop sensible coping strategies. Do not let extreme scenarios or low-probability events unduly influence investment decisions.\nParents sometimes have these expectations for their children, don\u0026rsquo;t impose your unfulfilled aspirations on them. \u0026ndash; Haoqing\nParents should respect their children\u0026rsquo;s individuality and interests and refrain from forcing their own unaccomplished goals onto them. Allowing children to have a joyful childhood and the autonomy to choose their own paths in life is more important than chasing conventional success.\nV. Summary # In this session, James reiterates the importance of mental fortitude in investing and the effectiveness of long-term investment and asset allocation strategies. By addressing listeners\u0026rsquo; practical concerns, such as retirement planning, market volatility, and capital security, he helps them better understand and apply these investment principles. James also provides advice on choosing appropriate investment targets and the purpose of holding cash, aiding listeners in constructing more comprehensive investment strategies. Haoqing\u0026rsquo;s sharing sparked reflection on educational philosophies and life values, advocating for a focus on children\u0026rsquo;s overall development and mental well-being.\nDisclaimer: This document is only for personal learning and note-taking purposes and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Topic # This session centered around investment cycles, exploring how to assess market cycles, highlighting the difficulty in distinguishing between acting too early and making wrong judgments during cycle shifts. It used Buffett\u0026rsquo;s actions during the 2008 financial crisis as a case study. Additionally, it discussed risks related to real estate investment, insurance, and stock pledges, while providing an in-depth analysis of asset allocation strategies, particularly comparing and recommending approaches for the Taiwanese and US markets.\nII. Briefing Content # Investment Cycles\nInvestor sentiment is likened to a pendulum, swinging between extreme fear and extreme optimism. Differentiating between premature judgments and incorrect ones during cycle changes is challenging, as exemplified by Buffett\u0026rsquo;s public announcement of buying stocks in late 2008, followed by a further 30% market decline. Swing trading is no longer recommended, as the market perpetually rises, making long-term investment the key. Risks of Real Estate Investment\nReal estate investment is considered high-risk, requiring maintenance and incurring high holding costs like property taxes and HOA fees. US property tax is a holding tax; the longer you hold, the more tax you pay. Rental yields are low, around 2% in the US Bay Area after deducting expenses. The biggest risks of buying a house are job loss and having outstanding mortgage debt at retirement. Insurance Choices\nAvoid commercial insurance, such as life insurance, long-term care insurance, universal life insurance, etc. Necessary insurance includes health insurance and term life insurance. Term life insurance is suitable for those who are the sole income source for their family, providing support for children under 18. Risks of Stock Pledging\nStock pledging is extremely risky, especially in the Taiwanese market, with a maintenance ratio requirement of 167%. Absolutely forbid using borrowed funds from stock pledges for reinvestment. In Taiwan, leveraged ETFs can be pledged, but risks still exist. Be cautious about diversifying risks in stock pledging in Taiwan. Do not pledge all assets to the same financial institution, and avoid pledging everything at once. Taiwanese investors are advised to adopt the \u0026ldquo;Situation 3\u0026rdquo; asset allocation strategy: 30% cash, 30% leverage, and 40% QQQ or other broad-based index funds. Asset Allocation Strategies\nWhen selecting investment targets, understand their risk and return characteristics, and allocate assets reasonably based on your circumstances. Long-term investment in QQQ index funds is like piloting an aircraft carrier—stable and offering considerable returns. Investing in individual stocks and sectors is like sailing a small boat—high risk and susceptible to market fluctuations. Investments in individual stocks and sectors are similar to the once-booming railway industry, which was eventually replaced by new technologies and industries. For example, the semiconductor industry may also be eliminated in the future. QQQ index funds have a replacement mechanism to promptly remove underperforming stocks, maintaining overall growth momentum. Investing in individual stocks requires the ability to identify potential opportunities and understand market and industry trends, as exemplified by James\u0026rsquo; interaction with NVIDIA\u0026rsquo;s CEO before its IPO and his purchase of Amazon shares during its slump. For retirement accounts, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to invest all Rust account funds in leveraged ETFs, while 401K accounts can hold cash or bonds. Be cautious when borrowing for investment; ensure cash flow can cover interest payments and manage risks effectively. In the US, if capital gains tax is implemented, consider transferring funds to other countries. Avoid investing in the Chinese market due to policy risks and economic downturn pressures. Do not purchase annuity products; they offer low returns and carry risks. After selling a house, do not deposit funds into IRA or traditional IRA accounts. Be decisive in investing and avoid hesitation. For example, loss-making properties should be sold as soon as possible, and the funds should be invested in the stock market. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Eric:\nSharing: Used the analogy of QQQ index funds being like aircraft carriers and individual stocks being like small boats to illustrate the advantages of index fund investing. Sharing: James\u0026rsquo; channel not only shares investment knowledge but also many life stories, such as estate planning and tax planning, from which valuable lessons can be learned. Brian:\nQuestion: For employed individuals using the \u0026ldquo;Situation 2\u0026rdquo; asset allocation strategy, is it possible to set a higher Beta value, such as 1.1 or 1.2? Answer: There is no upper limit for Beta, as long as cash is at least twice the amount of borrowed funds. Excel spreadsheets can be used to simulate investment outcomes under different scenarios, allowing adjustments based on individual risk tolerance. Mike:\nSharing: The US is like a Bogue bird, adept at concealing its strength and waiting for the opportune moment to reap the rewards, which aligns with the long-term investment philosophy. Question: Will the central bank ignore economic recession and focus solely on inflation? Answer: The central bank will not ignore economic recession because it leads to increased unemployment, which is one of the central bank\u0026rsquo;s key concerns. Economic recession and unemployment are closely related. Cheng Ge (PC):\nSharing: Illustrated the drawbacks of investment-linked insurance policies through a real-life case study, recommending early surrender and transferring funds to QQQ index funds to recoup losses within a shorter timeframe and achieve higher returns. Lang:\nQuestion: Is it feasible to utilize market downturns to buy QLD leveraged ETFs using a Roth IRA account and convert a 401K account to cash, aiming to increase the proportion of funds in the Roth IRA account? Answer: If Rust account funds are limited, they should all be invested in leveraged ETFs. The 401K account can hold cash as a hedge. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to wait for market downturns to make the switch; asset allocation should be completed as early as possible. Tina:\nQuestion: If the 401K account is already maxed out, is it still possible to invest in an IRA account? Answer: After maxing out the 401K account, you cannot contribute to a traditional IRA account, but you can contribute to a Roth IRA account. Specific eligibility depends on income level and IRA contribution limits. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to check the IRA contribution limit for relevant information. IAM:\nQuestion: Will events like the Malaysian currency devaluation and the Hong Kong emigration wave impact the US economy and the US dollar? How does the US prevent currency devaluation? Will the companies in the QQQ index fund be affected? Answer: A country\u0026rsquo;s currency value depends on its creditworthiness, which is backed by national industries and power. The US possesses strong national strength and diversified industries, allowing the US dollar to maintain its strong position. The US government will safeguard the interests of American companies and citizens. It\u0026rsquo;s uncertain whether US companies will be directly affected by US dollar devaluation, but they will undoubtedly be protected by the US government. TT:\nQuestion: Are you still considering cycle investing at present? Answer: Yes, cycle investing will be considered, but not through the all-in, all-out approach used in the past. Instead, Beta adjustments will be employed to navigate market volatility, as it\u0026rsquo;s difficult for a large number of investors to keep up with rapid trading, thus requiring a more robust strategy. Question: Which US political party, Democrat or Republican, is more favorable to investors? Answer: In the long run, policies of both parties have minimal impact on investors. The market adjusts according to policies; for example, higher tax rates may induce investors to hold assets for longer periods. YJ:\nQuestion: Are there any differences in asset allocation strategies between Taiwan and the US? What is the role of the 00864B bond? Why is investing in 00757 no longer recommended? Answer: Asset allocation strategies are universally applicable. The main differences between Taiwan and the US lie in stock pledging rules and leveraged ETF choices. 00864B can be used as a cash alternative, similar to a USD fixed deposit. Reasons for no longer recommending investment in 00757 can be found in the videos from 2021 and 2022. Jason:\nQuestion: Can dollar-cost averaging (DCA) be used to invest in leveraged ETFs like Q2D? Answer: When investing in any asset, including leveraged ETFs, lump-sum purchasing should be adopted instead of DCA. Returns from DCA are likely to be lower than lump-sum purchasing. IV. Key Takeaways # QQQ index funds are like aircraft carriers, offering stability and substantial returns, while individual stock and sector investments are like sailing small boats, carrying high risk and vulnerability to market fluctuations. \u0026ndash; James \u0026amp; Eric\nChoosing long-term investment in QQQ index funds can mitigate the risks associated with individual stocks and sector investments, providing more stable returns.\nThe central bank will not disregard economic recession, as it leads to rising unemployment, a key indicator that the central bank monitors. \u0026ndash; James\nOne of the objectives of the central bank\u0026rsquo;s monetary policy is to maintain low unemployment; therefore, it will not stand idly by in the face of economic recession.\nLoss aversion is a common mistake among investors. Losses should be cut promptly, and funds should be reallocated to higher-quality assets. \u0026ndash; Cheng Ge (PC)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s crucial to overcome the psychological barrier of loss aversion in investing, decisively cutting losses to prevent them from escalating.\nThe US\u0026rsquo;s national strength rests on four pillars: government, the financial industry, businesses, and national defense.

Returns from DCA are likely to be lower than lump-sum purchasing. \u0026ndash; James\n\u0026ldquo;Buy whenever you have money\u0026rdquo; is the investment strategy James consistently emphasizes. DCA is less efficient for long-term investment.\nV. Summary # This session primarily revolved around investment cycles, with James explaining how to identify market cycles and emphasizing the distinction between premature and incorrect judgments, using Buffett\u0026rsquo;s actions during the 2008 financial crisis as an example. Furthermore, it provided detailed insights into the risks of real estate investment, insurance selection, stock pledging, and asset allocation strategies. In the Q\u0026amp;A segment, students raised questions and shared their perspectives on topics such as the aircraft carrier investment strategy, property tax, central bank policy, currency devaluation, and investment strategy in the Taiwanese market.

Main Topic # This session focuses on long-term index fund investing. The core message is: hold index funds firmly, ignore market fluctuations, maintain a proper asset allocation, and leverage the compounding effect of time to achieve financial freedom. James also warns against investment scams and emphasizes avoiding unnecessary risks, while offering advice on investing in children\u0026rsquo;s education funds.\nII. Presentation Summary # Advantages of Index Funds: Long-term index fund investing eliminates the need to follow short-term market fluctuations, international affairs, financial reports, and economic data. Focus on asset allocation and consistent investment. The Power of Compounding: James uses several examples to illustrate the magic of compounding: A monthly investment of 1000 TWD can grow to 17.3 million TWD in 40 years; a lump-sum investment of 100,000 TWD can reach 18.8 million TWD in 40 years; starting early is crucial, as a 10-year delay significantly impacts final returns; one share of QQQ at 500 USD will become 25,000 USD in 30 years and 94,000 USD in 40 years. Safe Asset Allocation: Asset allocation is more critical than any market commentary. James recommends deleveraging and reducing debt for those nearing retirement, holding a larger cash position. For younger individuals with stable income, leveraging can be considered. He suggests using a beta of 1.0 as a benchmark, reducing beta when the market is overheated, and increasing it back to 1.0 during market downturns. For cash allocation, he references Buffett and suggests a sample allocation (Scenario 3): 40% index funds, 30% 2x leveraged funds, and 30% cash. Beware of Investment Scams: Don\u0026rsquo;t trust investment information from unknown accounts or websites. Choose legitimate financial institutions. Don\u0026rsquo;t Give Money Directly to Children: James uses personal anecdotes and case studies to caution against putting assets directly in children\u0026rsquo;s names, as this may discourage their initiative or cause family conflicts. However, investing children\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;lucky money\u0026rdquo; (red envelopes) for them is recommended as an educational fund. Risks of Real Estate Investment: James reiterates his advice against early homeownership for young people, arguing that real estate is illiquid, high-risk, and ties up capital that could be used for other investments. He highlights the added risk in Taiwan, where mortgage debt remains even after foreclosure. Recommended Learning Resources: He recommends a YouTube channel called \u0026ldquo;什么值得读\u0026rdquo; (What\u0026rsquo;s Worth Reading) for valuable content on value investing. Emergency Fund: Maintain a cash reserve equivalent to six months of living expenses in a money market fund account. Investing this emergency fund in stocks is not recommended. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Jeff:\nShares: Highlights misconceptions about investing held by two listeners and emphasizes the importance of carefully studying James\u0026rsquo;s lecture notes, particularly the chart on page two. James\u0026rsquo;s response: Affirms Jeff\u0026rsquo;s points and re-emphasizes the importance of a solid investment philosophy to avoid being swayed by market noise. Cat:\nShares: A listener holding 35 million TWD in 00662 still finds the 2% withdrawal rate insufficient. Discusses the spending needs and inheritance considerations of single individuals. James\u0026rsquo;s response: Different indices have different volatility and dividend yields, requiring adjustments to withdrawal rates. For higher withdrawals, consider ETFs with higher dividend yields, such as 0056, which yields around 4-5%. H:\nQuestion: High rental costs for young people, should they buy a house? Mortgages offer tax deductions, while renting does not. Concerned about insufficient funds for leveraged investing. James\u0026rsquo;s response: Recommends watching the \u0026ldquo;30 Years of Different Destinies\u0026rdquo; video, which analyzes the pros and cons of renting versus buying. Young people should prioritize investing in index funds to build wealth through compounding and consider buying a house later. Yonglin:\nQuestion: Should money be invested in children\u0026rsquo;s names for long-term holding? Should a mortgage-free house be sold to invest in index funds after retirement? James\u0026rsquo;s response: Advises against putting money directly in children\u0026rsquo;s names. Retirees should deleverage, and selling a mortgage-free house to invest in index funds is a viable option. Mike:\nShares: Success story of investing his children\u0026rsquo;s education fund in QQQ. Gives the example of Taoyuan Language in Taiwan, suggesting potential leveraged investment through real estate mortgages. Question: How to establish a family trust and manage generational wealth like the Rockefeller family? James\u0026rsquo;s response: Recommends contacting Lisa for trust advice when assets reach a certain level and age. For now, focus on investing. Trusts can be considered around 70-80 years old. Single individuals or those without children should rely on trusts, appointing guardians and executors. Those with children can consider Trust 2.0, with the bank as executor and children as supervisors. Family foundations managed by professional institutions are also an option. Recommends the Walmart family\u0026rsquo;s living trust as a model. Becky, Jessie, and Other Participants:\nBecky: Difficulties of renting at an older age. Jessie: How to balance saving for an emergency fund, paying off a mortgage, and investing simultaneously. Other Participants: Questions about real estate investment, cash management, insurance, Bitcoin, and Japanese government bonds. James\u0026rsquo;s response: Addresses each question and reiterates his investment philosophy. For example, young people should avoid real estate and insurance due to high risks; long-term bonds and municipal bonds are not suitable for emergency funds. IV. Key Takeaways # Time is the source of all power. \u0026ndash; James\nJames uses examples like the evolution of Earth\u0026rsquo;s ecosystem and human evolution to illustrate the power of time and emphasize the importance of long-term investing.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t casually help others with money. People will resent you for it for a lifetime. \u0026ndash; James\nCautions against testing human nature with money and emphasizes setting boundaries with financial assistance.\nThe earlier you invest, the better. Keep enough emergency funds. The earlier you invest, the lower the risk. \u0026ndash; Jeff\nEmphasizes the importance of early investing and maintaining an emergency fund.\nLaugh a little; how long a scammer can scam is determined by the fool. \u0026ndash; Mike\nA cynical comment on the prevalence of scammers and a reminder to stay vigilant.\nV. Conclusion # The core message of this session remains long-term index fund investing. James uses clear language and vivid examples to reiterate the power of compounding and the importance of starting early. He also addresses audience questions on asset allocation, real estate, trusts, emergency funds, and children\u0026rsquo;s education funds, sharing advice on avoiding common investment traps and achieving financial freedom. He further recommends learning resources and provides commentary on social phenomena.\nDisclaimer: This document is for personal learning notes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Topic # During periods of market volatility, investors should prioritize risk control and maintain a positive and optimistic mindset. By establishing a rational asset allocation strategy, such as holding cash, index funds, and leveraged funds, and selecting an appropriate allocation plan based on individual circumstances, investors can effectively mitigate market risks and ensure survival even in extreme situations.\nII. Briefing Content # Investment Objective: Identify high-quality investment targets, such as market-capitalization-weighted index funds, and hold them for the long term. Avoid chasing high-return investment targets, as excessive volatility may lead to an inability to hold, ultimately hindering returns.\nRisk Control:\nDo not overestimate your risk tolerance, as market downturns often exceed expectations. Selling leads to permanent losses; the only mistake in the market is selling. Investing is a process that goes against human nature, requiring the overcoming of fear and greed. Always ensure survival in extreme market conditions, meaning possessing sufficient cash flow to sustain living expenses. Holding cash is crucial for mitigating risks. Investment Mindset:\nInvestors should remain perpetually optimistic, believing that the market will eventually rise. Be patient, as wealth accumulation takes time. Do not be swayed by short-term market fluctuations; adhere to a long-term investment strategy. Do not attempt to predict the market, and ignore market noise. Keep investing simple: buy when you have money and hold for the long term; avoid excessive trading. Asset Allocation:\nThe highest guiding principle of asset allocation is: you can still survive under extreme market conditions. Retirees need to hold more cash and can utilize leveraged funds to enhance returns while reducing risks. Employed individuals can choose different asset allocation plans based on their circumstances, but ensure a certain proportion of cash holdings. Do not alter your asset allocation based on market ups and downs, as this constitutes short-term trading behavior. Asset allocation needs to be adjusted based on individual situations. For example, when significant events like retirement or purchasing a house occur, reassessment and adjustment of the asset allocation plan are necessary. Leverage initially carries higher risk, which gradually decreases as the market rises. It is recommended that retirement accounts comprise at least 30% of total assets to effectively avoid taxes during rebalancing. Market Efficiency:\nThe market is efficient; it\u0026rsquo;s nearly impossible to find opportunities for consistent excess returns. Do not readily believe investment strategies claiming to achieve excess returns, as they are often unsustainable. The Role of Wall Street:\nWall Street\u0026rsquo;s primary roles are to provide liquidity and investment products, establish the framework for investment transactions, and lower the barriers to entry, allowing ordinary investors to participate. Investors need to understand how Wall Street operates to avoid falling into its traps. Market makers are a crucial part of Wall Street. They profit by providing bid-ask spreads while also offering liquidity to the market. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IM:\nSharing: Black swan events remind us that people are forgetful, easily becoming optimistic during market upswings and panicking during downturns. Question: How to control optimism and avoid overconfidence leading to bankruptcy? James\u0026rsquo;s response: Remember the highest guiding principle of asset allocation, ensuring survival under extreme conditions. Cash is the lifeline for survival. Sunny:\nQuestion: How to persuade people around me not to purchase insurance and financial products? James\u0026rsquo;s response: By calculating the annualized return rate of insurance products and comparing it with the return rates of other investment products, you can demonstrate that insurance and financial products offer lower returns. You can compare the return rates of insurance products with the long-term returns of index funds and point out that the income source for insurance companies and insurance agents is the premiums paid by customers. Jason:\nSharing: Experienced Apple Vision Pro and found its spatial computing capabilities impressive, but currently, it has limited functionality and applications, along with a high price tag. Question: If investing is so simple, what is the role of Wall Street experts? James\u0026rsquo;s response: Wall Street\u0026rsquo;s role primarily lies in providing liquidity, investment products, and the trading infrastructure, lowering the barriers to entry, enabling ordinary investors to participate in the market. Market makers are an essential component of Wall Street, making profits by providing bid-ask spreads while also offering liquidity to the market. Brian:\nQuestion: How can employed individuals utilize the asset allocation plan in Scenario 9? James\u0026rsquo;s response: Scenario 9 is suitable for retired individuals with loans. If you are employed and have substantial loans, such as a mortgage, you need to adjust the plan based on your circumstances. For example, pay off a portion of the loan before proceeding with asset allocation. Moreover, leverage carries higher risk initially, which gradually decreases as the market rises. Question: How to allocate and rebalance assets between a 401K account and a Roth IRA account? James\u0026rsquo;s response: It\u0026rsquo;s recommended that retirement accounts comprise at least 30% of total assets for effective tax avoidance during rebalancing. Due to the limited investment options within a 401K account, direct purchase of QQQ may not be possible. You can use similar alternatives or transfer funds to a Roth IRA account for more flexibility. Yingying:\nQuestion: What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between QQQ and QQQM? James\u0026rsquo;s response: The market is efficient. There won\u0026rsquo;t be a significant difference in the long-term returns of QQQ and QQQM. Choose QQQ, which has lower fees. Grace:\nQuestion: Should I convert 0066 to 00670L during a market downturn? James\u0026rsquo;s response: Do not change your asset allocation based on market fluctuations, as this constitutes short-term trading behavior. Using Fatality:\nJames\u0026rsquo;s response: Charles Schwab is recommended because it is both a brokerage and a bank, offering higher security. Fidelity only has brokerage services and lacks a banking license, potentially facing risks during financial crises. IV. Key Insights # The highest guiding principle of investing is: you can still survive under extreme market conditions. \u0026ndash; James\nUnder any circumstances, ensure that you have sufficient cash flow to sustain your living expenses. This is the bottom line of investing.\nWhere are Wall Street\u0026rsquo;s yachts? Where are the clients\u0026rsquo; yachts? \u0026ndash; James\nThis vividly illustrates Wall Street\u0026rsquo;s profit model, reminding investors to be wary of its various fees and traps.\nLook down upon the poor and favor the rich. \u0026ndash; Zero seven\u0026rsquo;s teacher\nThis phrase reveals the harsh reality of Wall Street in the past and reflects the inequality of investment opportunities.\nThe market is efficient; you cannot have excess profits. \u0026ndash; James\nThis emphasizes the efficient market hypothesis, reminding investors not to seek easy opportunities for excess returns.\nV. Conclusion # This episode reiterates the importance of risk control and investment mindset, providing a detailed explanation of how to allocate assets under different circumstances and how to perceive the market and the role of Wall Street. Through interactive Q\u0026amp;A with the audience, James addresses various investment-related questions and offers practical advice.\nDisclaimer: This article is for personal learning notes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Theme # This session focuses on the philosophy of long-term investing, emphasizing the importance of independent thinking and risk management. James reiterates his long-held investment philosophy: choose the right investment target (such as QQQ), buy in early and hold for the long term, ignoring short-term market fluctuations, and ultimately achieve steady wealth growth. In addition, he discusses how to maintain a positive mindset, deal with stress and anxiety that may arise during the investment process, and how to choose a reliable brokerage to ensure account security.\nII. Briefing Content # Wealth is accumulated slowly, and enjoying the process of wealth accumulation is the meaning of life. Getting rich overnight or quickly is not the best way. Slowly accumulating wealth and enjoying it allows you to experience the true meaning of life and learn and grow from it. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly pursue high returns while ignoring risks. Many people pursue quick riches and hope for super high returns, but often overlook the risks involved, which may ultimately lead to losses outweighing gains. Learn to assess risk and choose an investment strategy that matches your risk tolerance. Investing requires finding a definite eternity, ignoring market noise, and maintaining inner peace. Index fund investing is a definite and eternal strategy that does not require painstaking research and operation. Simply holding for the long term can yield considerable returns. Investment is a loser\u0026rsquo;s game, not seeking to win, but seeking not to lose. In investing, avoiding mistakes is more important than pursuing victory. Index fund investing can help investors reduce mistakes and ultimately achieve victory. Buying in a lump sum at any time and holding for the long term is superior to other investment methods. Investing early and holding for the long term maximizes returns and delivers the best investment returns. Learn to distinguish between what can be done, what is effective, what can be worried about, and what is not worth worrying about. Focus your energy on important and solvable issues, ignore those that are irrelevant or beyond your control to improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary anxiety. Don\u0026rsquo;t work too hard, let your money work for you. Put your money into the market and let it create wealth for you instead of devoting all your energy to work. Learn to utilize investment tools to achieve passive wealth growth. All pressure comes from expectations, and all worries come from not having a solution. Lower your expectations and actively seek solutions to relieve stress and anxiety. Learn to transfer pressure to those who can bear it and think about solutions for the worst-case scenario. Don\u0026rsquo;t bear the pressure alone, learn to seek help, and think in advance about solutions to the worst-case scenario to calmly deal with challenges. Maintain inner peace, focus on the important things, and ignore the insignificant things. Stick to simple things, don\u0026rsquo;t get involved in complex things, to maintain inner peace and focus on what really matters in life. Account security is the primary issue in investing. Choose a large, reputable brokerage to open an account and avoid using online brokers. Online brokers have security risks, such as account theft and asset freezing. Choosing a large, reputable brokerage can better protect your account security. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Dave:\nSharing: Shared the results of James\u0026rsquo; TQQQ simulation backtest and raised the question of how to avoid the risk of a sharp TQQQ drawdown. Question and James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: James believes that it is impossible to predict the market and avoid all risks completely. The important thing is to control risk exposure and avoid over-betting. If you are worried about the volatility of TQQQ, you can choose a more conservative investment strategy, such as QQQ. James also reminds everyone to distinguish between personal thinking and public advice, and not to be easily swayed by the thoughts of others. Minjianlian:\nSharing: Shared his experience of investing in stocks through his company\u0026rsquo;s savings association, as well as discussions about the MAGS fund and emergency funds. Question and James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: About the MAGS fund: James believes that it is uncertain whether the MAGS fund can outperform QQQ in the long term. Investment should choose targets that have been tested by time, such as QQQ or SPY. About emergency funds: James believes that emergency funds are a personal responsibility and government policies cannot be relied upon entirely. Everyone should prepare sufficient emergency funds according to their own circumstances to cope with contingencies. Learn:\nQuestion and James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Regarding the performance of 00670L, James explained the performance difference caused by USD hedging and how to solve it by investing in QLD through sub-brokerage. He emphasized that Beta and ROI are different concepts. Beta represents volatility, not ROI. The investment model in Taiwan needs to be adjusted according to specific circumstances, such as maintenance margin requirements and exchange rate fluctuations. JJU:\nSharing: Shared his insights on market unpredictability and the importance of mentors and friends. He believes that investing, in addition to selecting good targets, is more about maintaining inner peace and enhancing one\u0026rsquo;s spiritual level. Question and James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: About the difference between reinvest and buy share: James explained the difference between reinvesting and buying shares. The former automatically invests dividends or capital gains into the investment target, while the latter uses new funds to buy shares. About the fund ratio of Roth IRA and Individual Brokerage Account: It is recommended to maximize the Roth IRA limit if possible. About real estate mortgage investment: It is recommended to sell the property if possible to reduce the risk of investing in real estate. Otherwise, consider a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) for investment, but pay attention to risk control and ensure that you can repay the loan on time. HELOC is a revolving credit line, similar to a credit card, which can be withdrawn and repaid at any time. Draft down:\nSharing: Proposed the possibility of leveraging 0% interest credit cards for investment and using the box spread strategy to increase capital utilization. Question and James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: About credit card investment: James believes that credit card limits are limited and there is a risk of not being able to renew the loan, making it unsuitable as a main source of investment funds. It is only suitable for short-term turnover of small amounts of funds. About the box spread strategy: James believes that the box spread strategy is too complex and risky and is not recommended for ordinary investors. Jason:\nQuestion and James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: How to overcome short-term pain in the investment process: James suggested lowering expectations, not pursuing perfection or getting rich quickly, finding solutions to problems, and transferring the pressure to those who can bear it, such as superiors or more experienced individuals. Think about solutions for the worst-case scenario, such as job loss or investment losses, and maintain a positive mindset, believing that the problem will eventually be solved. About non-US tax resident investing in US stocks: James believes that non-US tax residents can use their passports to open brokerage accounts in the US without a Social Security Number. It is recommended to choose large, reputable brokers, such as Charles Schwab, and avoid using online brokers, such as Webull and Robinhood, as online brokers have security risks and imperfect regulations.
