Content Summary # The core concept of this book is that everyone can achieve financial freedom through investment, not just the wealthy or high-income earners. Through thirteen Investment Iron Laws, it emphasizes the importance of correct financial management concepts and long-term investment, encouraging readers to start managing their finances early, invest primarily in high-return investment tools such as stocks and real estate, and hold them for the long term, ultimately achieving financial freedom through the power of compound interest. The book uses numerous real-life examples and simple language to help readers understand and master correct financial management methods, while abandoning common financial management misunderstandings, such as short-term trading and over-reliance on bank deposits.\nII. Chapter Summaries # Correct Concept of Personal Finance # Personal investment can lead to wealth: The author believes that personal investment is not only a means to improve financial status but also an important path to wealth. Even if the monthly investment amount is small, as long as you persevere, you can accumulate considerable wealth by relying on the power of compound interest and ultimately realize the dream of becoming a billionaire. The book illustrates the power of compound interest with the example of investing 1200 Yuan per month with an annual return of 20%, resulting in assets exceeding 100 million Yuan after 40 years. It also cites the financial stories of the Lien Chan family and a postman to prove that even ordinary office workers can accumulate huge wealth with proper financial management. Increasing income and reducing expenditure treats the symptoms, not the root cause: Although diligence and frugality are traditional virtues, it is difficult to achieve financial freedom solely by relying on them in the era of rapid economic development. The author believes that financial management is more important than increasing income and reducing expenditure. The core of financial management lies in \u0026ldquo;making money with money\u0026rdquo; by achieving higher returns through investment, thereby enabling wealth to grow exponentially. The book uses the Lien Chan family\u0026rsquo;s financial management methods as an example to illustrate the importance of investing in stocks and real estate. It points out that the Lien family did not start with huge wealth but accumulated astonishing wealth through long-term investment and financial management. Financial management methods cause the wealth gap: The author believes that the main cause of the wealth gap is not external factors such as family background, personal effort, or luck, but the difference in financial concepts and methods. The rich tend to invest their assets in high-yield investment tools such as stocks and real estate, while the poor tend to deposit money in banks, resulting in a slow rate of wealth appreciation. The book uses the example of two classmates who joined the same company after graduation to illustrate how different financial management methods eventually lead to vastly different wealth outcomes. Investment Iron Law 1: Don\u0026rsquo;t Save Money in the Bank # Saving is equal to wasting resources: The author points out that keeping money in the bank seems safe but is actually a waste of resources. This is because bank deposit interest rates are low, and under the influence of inflation, the real rate of return is close to zero or even negative. This means that money deposited in the bank not only fails to appreciate but also depreciates. The book uses biblical stories and the example of the Nobel Prize Foundation to illustrate that not making good use of wealth, even without loss, is a waste. Deposit interest rates do not have compound interest benefits: Although bank deposits also enjoy compound interest, due to the low interest rate, the effect of compound interest is very limited and difficult to withstand the erosion of inflation. The author compares the final returns of two investment methods after 40 years, using a 5% bank interest rate and a 20% stock/real estate investment return rate as examples, illustrating the importance of the rate of return on investment. The invisible killer of currency value - inflation: Inflation is the \u0026ldquo;invisible killer\u0026rdquo; that causes money to depreciate. The author vividly illustrates the impact of inflation by comparing the price of red bean ice 30 years ago and now. He points out that in an inflationary environment, depositing money in the bank actually means \u0026ldquo;the more you save, the less you have\u0026rdquo;. The way to wealth of Zhang Pingsan, former chairman of Chang Hwa Bank: The author tells the story of Zhang Pingsan, the former chairman of Chang Hwa Bank, who achieved tremendous wealth growth by continuously borrowing money to buy Chang Hwa Bank shares and holding them for a long time. Those who sold their shares and put the money in the bank missed the opportunity to become wealthy. This once again proves the point that \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t save money in the bank\u0026rdquo;. The money deposited in the bank should not exceed living expenses: The author suggests that the amount of money deposited in the bank should be limited to meet two months of living expenses, and the excess should be used for investment to obtain higher returns. He also proposes a \u0026ldquo;two large, one small\u0026rdquo; investment portfolio suggestion: most assets are invested in stocks and real estate, and a small portion of funds is deposited in the bank for emergencies. He explains the liquidity of stocks and real estate to dispel readers\u0026rsquo; concerns about investment liquidity. Investment Iron Law 2: Be Patient to Get Rich Through Financial Management # How Li Ka-shing accumulated wealth: The author uses Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong\u0026rsquo;s richest man, as an example to illustrate the importance of long-term investment. Li Ka-shing accumulated huge wealth through long-term investment in real estate. Getting rich through financial management requires time and patience; it is impossible to achieve overnight success. His success was not solely based on luck or hard work; more importantly, it was due to his long-term vision and perseverance. It takes a long time to see the effect of compound interest in financial management: The manifestation of the compound interest effect takes time, and it is difficult to see significant results in short-term investments. The author uses the example of investing 14,000 Yuan annually with an annual return of 20% to calculate the investment returns after 10, 20, 30, and 40 years, which are 360,000 Yuan, 2.61 million Yuan, 16.55 million Yuan, and 102.81 million Yuan, respectively. This set of data clearly demonstrates the power of compound interest and the importance of waiting patiently. Financial management is more like a marathon than a sprint. As long as you are patient, the money won\u0026rsquo;t run away: Wealth accumulation is a gradual process that requires patience to wait for the compound interest effect to play out. The author uses the land investment experience of Zhang Yaohongying, Chairman of Hongjing Construction, as an example to illustrate that even if the initial investment return is not obvious, as long as you persist in holding it for a long time, you can eventually get a rich return. Getting rich overnight is counterproductive: The author warns readers that getting rich through financial management takes time, and they should not dream of getting rich quickly. Investment opportunities that bring rapid wealth in the short term are often accompanied by extremely high risks, which may eventually lead to losing everything. The author suggests that if you want to get rich quickly, you should choose to start a business instead of resorting to speculation. Investment Iron Law 3: The Sooner You Start Investing, the Better # Procrastination is the main reason for financial failure: The author points out that procrastination is one of the main reasons for financial failure. As age increases, the time available for investment decreases, and the space for the compound interest effect to play out also shrinks. Therefore, financial management should start as early as possible. Do not wait until you are older to realize the importance of financial management, as it is often too late. Start investing from today: The earlier you start investing, the longer the time for compound interest, and the higher the final return. The author calculates the monthly investment amount required under the same target amount and investment rate of return with different starting investment ages as examples. The data shows that the later you start investing, the higher the monthly investment amount required, highlighting the importance of starting financial management early. Jeffrey Koo Jr. is good at making money: The author uses the example of Jeffrey Koo Jr., Vice President of CTBC Financial Holding, to illustrate that even those from wealthy families should learn financial management early. Jeffrey Koo Jr. invested his savings in the stock market during his university days and obtained substantial returns, indicating that young people can also achieve success through financial management. Don\u0026rsquo;t neglect financial management because of lack of money: The author emphasizes that financial management is not exclusive to the rich. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have much money, you should start as early as possible and let the limited funds play the role of compound interest, accumulating little by little to eventually accumulate considerable wealth. Youth is the most appropriate time to take risks: When you are young, you have a lighter family burden and the cost of failure is relatively low, so it is more suitable to take certain investment risks. Moreover, young people have more time to make up for potential losses and learn from their mistakes. Investment Iron Law 4: Make Money with Other People\u0026rsquo;s Money # Good use of debt investment: The author introduces the concept of \u0026ldquo;financial leverage,\u0026rdquo; which refers to using borrowed funds for investment to achieve a small investment with a large return, maximizing profits. He uses the examples of Chen Youhao, President of Eastern Multimedia Group, and Weng Daming of Hualon Group to illustrate how successful entrepreneurs use financial leverage for business expansion and investment. Specific examples are used to calculate the investment return rate under different leverage ratios to help readers understand the principle and role of financial leverage. Two major principles of borrowing: The author proposes two major principles for debt investment: 1. The expected return on investment must be greater than the loan interest rate; 2. In the worst case, cash income must be sufficient to pay the principal and interest of the loan. These two principles emphasize the risks of debt investment and remind readers to rationally evaluate the expected rate of return of the investment target and conduct risk assessment to ensure that even if the investment fails, the principal and interest of the loan can be repaid on time. Banks are not places to save money: The author points out that for people who are good at financial management, banks are not places to save money but sources of borrowing. He explains the operating model of banks: Banks absorb deposits from depositors and then lend these funds to investors. Investors make profits through investment and pay interest to banks. Therefore, people who are good at financial management can use bank funds for investment to magnify returns. Avoid improper debt: The author cautions readers to avoid improper debt. Do not borrow money to participate in high-risk activities such as futures, margin trading, and gambling because the expected return rate of these activities is negative, and long-term participation will inevitably lead to losses. Also, do not over-engage in consumer loans, such as credit card loans and car loans, as high-interest loans will seriously erode personal wealth. Mortgage loans are acceptable, but you should also live within your means and make sure that the monthly repayment pressure is within your affordable range. Investment Iron Law 5: Relieve the Pressure of Investment Risks # Analyze risks and reduce harm: The author points out that risks cannot be completely avoided in the investment process. The purpose of risk management is not to eliminate risk but to analyze risk and reduce the potential harm caused by risk. He emphasizes not to over-rely on forecasting because the accuracy of forecasting is difficult to guarantee, and over-reliance on forecasting may lead investors to lose their risk awareness. Forbes\u0026rsquo; philosophy of distress: The author uses the example of American billionaire Forbes to illustrate that even risk-averse people can take risks through reasonable risk management. Although Forbes doesn\u0026rsquo;t like adventure, in order to experience the beauty of life, he will participate in some high-risk activities, such as hot air ballooning and off-road motorcycles. But he will make full preparations before taking risks and take various measures to reduce risks. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly avoid risks: The author believes that in a changing environment, the biggest risk is not taking risks. In order to obtain higher returns, certain risks must be taken. Blindly avoiding risks may eventually lead to missed opportunities and even failure to achieve financial freedom. Overcome risks - start small: For unfamiliar investments, you should start with small investments, gradually accumulate experience, and gradually improve your risk tolerance. Just like scouts, first test the waters with a small amount to understand the situation, and then gradually increase the investment. There is no high-return, zero-risk investment: The author reminds readers that all high-yield investments are accompanied by high risks and not to believe in the so-called \u0026ldquo;high-yield, risk-free\u0026rdquo; investment scams. If someone recommends such an investment opportunity to you, it is likely that they are trying to deceive you. Investment Iron Law 6: Solve the Crisis of Being Trapped # Diversify your investments and hold them for the long term: The author proposes the investment strategy of \u0026ldquo;diversification and long-term holding\u0026rdquo; and believes that this is the key to avoiding being trapped and obtaining long-term stable returns. Diversified investment can reduce the risk of choosing the wrong investment target; diversifying investment timing can reduce the risk of buying at market highs; long-term holding can reduce the risk brought by short-term market fluctuations and fully enjoy the benefits brought by compound interest. Principle of risk diversification: The principle of diversified investment is to reduce the overall risk of the investment portfolio by increasing the types of investments so that the rise and fall of different assets in the investment portfolio can offset each other. The author points out that diversification is not the more the better and that management costs need to be considered. Too many investment types will increase management difficulty and cost, which is not conducive to improving profits. Diversify investment timing: In order to reduce the risk of buying at market highs, the author suggests spreading the funds over different periods. He proposes two methods: one is \u0026ldquo;invest if you have money,\u0026rdquo; and the other is \u0026ldquo;regularly invest a fixed amount in mutual funds.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Invest if you have money\u0026rdquo; means that once you have idle funds, invest immediately and do not try to predict market timing; \u0026ldquo;regular investment of a fixed amount in mutual funds\u0026rdquo; means investing a fixed amount every month to buy mutual funds. This method can effectively smooth market fluctuations and reduce investment risks. Methods of diversified investment: The author introduces three methods of diversified investment in detail: 1. Diversification of investment tools, such as stocks, real estate, gold, art, etc.; 2. Diversification of investment targets, for example, when investing in stocks, do not just buy one stock, but buy multiple stocks in different industries; 3. Diversification of investment regions, for example, invest some assets in overseas markets to diversify regional risks. Reduce the risk of choosing the wrong selling time - long-term holding: Through research on the Taiwan stock market, the author found that the longer the holding time, the lower the probability of loss. For example, the probability of loss when holding stocks for more than 5 years is only 1%, and it is almost impossible to lose money when holding for more than 10 years. This once again proves the importance of long-term holding. Investment Iron Law 7: Make Good Use of Stock Investment # Liu Qiude\u0026rsquo;s secret to wealth: The author uses the financial story of Liu Qiude, Vice President of Cathay Life Insurance, as an example to illustrate the power of long-term holding of high-quality stocks. Liu Qiude worked at Cathay Life Insurance from his twenties. He held his savings and the Cathay Life Insurance shares he acquired from his colleagues for a long time and eventually became a billionaire. This example also reflects the long-term and stable performance growth of Cathay Life Insurance from the side. Why stocks have high returns: The author explains the source of returns from stock investment: stocks represent ownership of a company, and shareholders can share in the company\u0026rsquo;s profits and asset appreciation. Therefore, the returns from investing in stocks come from corporate earnings and asset appreciation, not from the losses of other investors. He pointed out that the long-term rise in stock prices is mainly due to the improvement of corporate profitability and the growth of asset value. Carefully select the types of stocks to invest in: The author compares the characteristics of listed stocks, over-the-counter stocks, unlisted stocks, and mutual funds and suggests that ordinary investors should give priority to investing in listed stocks or mutual funds. Listed stocks have good liquidity, transparent information disclosure, and relatively strict supervision, so the risks are relatively low. Mutual funds are managed by professionals and can effectively diversify investment risks, making them suitable for investors who do not have much time and energy to research stocks. Stock investment is better than real estate investment: The author compares stock and real estate investment from the aspects of investment threshold, taxation, and trading convenience. He believes that stock investment has a lower threshold, lighter taxes, and is more convenient to trade, making it more suitable for ordinary investors. Can stocks still maintain high returns in the future?: The author analyzes and forecasts the future return rate of the Taiwan stock market. He believes that although Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s economic growth has slowed down, it is still higher than other countries and regions, so the Taiwan stock market still has high investment value in the future, but the return rate may be slightly lower than in the past. Investment Iron Law 8: Make Money When You Buy and Sell # Buy casually, buy at any time, don\u0026rsquo;t sell: The author once again emphasizes the investment strategy of \u0026ldquo;buy casually, buy at any time, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; and points out that this is the highest level of financial management. This strategy seems simple, but it actually contains profound investment wisdom: it emphasizes long-term holding, infrequent trading, and avoiding being affected by short-term market fluctuations, thereby obtaining long-term and stable returns. The author admits that most people find it difficult to do this because they cannot overcome human weaknesses such as greed and fear. What to buy - buy casually: The author points out that as long as diversified investment is achieved, the selection of individual stocks is not important. He uses the experiment of \u0026ldquo;monkeys throwing darts to select stocks\u0026rdquo; and his own experience of selecting stocks with his children as examples to illustrate the effectiveness of \u0026ldquo;buying casually\u0026rdquo;. When to buy - buy at any time: The author suggests that investors \u0026ldquo;buy if they have money\u0026rdquo;, and do not try to predict market timing. He emphasizes \u0026ldquo;buying and waiting for a chance to rise\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;waiting for a chance to buy\u0026rdquo;. Because the market is difficult to predict, and time is the key factor in compound interest, the earlier you start investing, the more you can enjoy the benefits brought by compound interest. When to sell - don\u0026rsquo;t sell: The author believes that long-term holding is the key to obtaining high returns. He quotes Jesse Livermore, the author of Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, and the investment strategy of Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s richest man, Cai Wanlin, to illustrate the importance of long-term holding. Random walk and efficient market theory: The author introduces the \u0026ldquo;random walk hypothesis\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;efficient market hypothesis\u0026rdquo; to provide a theoretical basis for the strategy of \u0026ldquo;buy casually, buy at any time, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo;. The \u0026ldquo;random walk hypothesis\u0026rdquo; believes that short-term fluctuations in stock prices are random and difficult to predict; the \u0026ldquo;efficient market hypothesis\u0026rdquo; believes that all information in the market is already reflected in stock prices, so it is futile to predict market trends by analyzing information. Investment Iron Law 9: Grasp the General Trend of the Stock Market # Blind spots in prediction and analysis: The author once again emphasizes the limitations of prediction and analysis. He points out that technical analysis and market forecasting cannot guarantee investment success, and may even lead to losses due to frequent trading. Technical analysis is based on historical data, but the market environment is constantly changing, and past performance does not represent future trends. The only thing that can be measured is the unmeasurable: Market trends are difficult to predict. Instead of trying to predict the market, it is better to formulate a reasonable investment strategy and hold it for a long time. The author illustrates the unreliability of prediction with an example of a failed stock market prophet. Believe in yourself rather than experts: The author advises investors not to over-rely on expert opinions and to cultivate their own financial management capabilities and independent judgment. He pointed out that expert opinions often contradict each other, and ten experts may have eleven opinions. Besides, experts may also be influenced by various factors, such as conflicts of interest, and thus give biased opinions. Investment Iron Law 10: Make Good Use of Stock Market Offensive and Defensive Weapons # Value strategy: The core of value strategy is \u0026ldquo;buy when the value is higher than the price, and sell when the value is lower than the price\u0026rdquo;. The author uses the huge difference in the share price of China Development Financial at different times as an example to illustrate the impact of market sentiment on stock prices and the performance of investors\u0026rsquo; irrational behavior. He advises investors to learn rational consumption behavior and buy stocks when the \u0026ldquo;price is discounted\u0026rdquo;. He also points out that the key to value investing is being able to accurately assess the intrinsic value of a company, which requires certain professional knowledge and experience. Growth strategy: The core of the growth strategy is to invest in companies with high growth potential in the future and hold them for the long term. The author uses Peter Lynch\u0026rsquo;s investment strategy and the investment story of the \u0026ldquo;Coca-Cola Grandma\u0026rdquo; as examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the growth strategy. He advises investors to choose companies with high growth potential in the next 5-10 years and focus on choosing the right industry because the growth of the industry will drive the growth of corporate performance. Contrarian strategy: The core of the contrarian strategy is \u0026ldquo;invest when most people are not investing, and sell when most people are eager to invest\u0026rdquo;. The author uses the business philosophy of Fan Li and the investment strategy of Zheng Zhoumin as examples to illustrate the principle of contrarian operation. He pointed out that market sentiment is often wrong. When the market is excessively pessimistic, it is often a good time to buy; when the market is excessively optimistic, it is often a good time to sell. However, contrarian operation is very difficult, and it requires investors to have independent thinking ability and strong psychological quality. Value, growth, and contrarian strategies are suitable for experts: The author summarizes the characteristics of the three strategies and points out that these strategies are more suitable for professional investors. For ordinary investors, the strategy of \u0026ldquo;buy casually, buy at any time, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; is simpler and easier to implement, and it is also easier to obtain long-term and stable returns. Investment Iron Law 11: Don\u0026rsquo;t Do Short-Term Operations # Buy low and sell high is full of crises: The author pointed out that \u0026ldquo;buying low and selling high\u0026rdquo; seems to be the secret to making money from stock investment, but it is actually full of traps. Because no one can accurately predict the short-term fluctuations of the market, trying to make profits through \u0026ldquo;buying low and selling high\u0026rdquo; will often fall into the dilemma of chasing ups and downs, which will eventually lead to losses. He emphasizes that the main source of stock investment income is corporate profits and dividends, not the difference in buying and selling prices. Short-term operation is gambling: The author believes that the essence of short-term operation is speculation and gambling, and it is difficult to make a profit in the long run. Because short-term operations require frequent trading, and each transaction will generate transaction costs, such as commissions, stamp duty, etc. These transaction costs will eat away at investment income, and accumulate over time, will have a significant negative impact on investment returns. A game with no chance of winning: The author analyzes the composition of the stock market, including intermediaries (securities companies, governments, etc.), major shareholders, major players, and retail investors. He pointed out that retail investors are at a clear disadvantage in this game of short-term operations because they lack the advantages of capital, information, and resources. Therefore, retail investors should avoid participating in short-term operations and adopt a long-term investment strategy. Never participate in futures and margin trading: The author strongly recommends that investors not participate in futures and margin trading because these transactions are extremely risky, and the leverage effect will magnify both profits and losses. It is difficult for ordinary investors to control the risks. He uses the example of the Barings Bank collapse to illustrate the huge risks of futures and margin trading. Investment Iron Law 12: Land is Wealth # Why real estate has high returns: The author analyzes the reasons for the high returns of real estate investment, mainly including three aspects: 1. Limited land supply; 2. As the economy grows and the population grows, the demand for real estate continues to increase; 3. Inflation will push up real estate prices. Hong Kong\u0026rsquo;s richest man, Lee Shau Kee\u0026rsquo;s real estate investment strategy: The author introduces the real estate investment strategy of Hong Kong\u0026rsquo;s richest man, Lee Shau Kee: acquire old buildings at low prices, then demolish and rebuild them, or hold land for a long time and wait for appreciation. Cai Wanlin\u0026rsquo;s secret to getting rich in real estate: The author uses Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s richest man, Cai Wanlin, as an example to illustrate the real estate investment strategy of \u0026ldquo;buy and hold for the long term.\u0026rdquo; Cai Wanlin\u0026rsquo;s secret is to buy real estate and hold it for a long time, only renting and not selling. Zheng Zhoumin\u0026rsquo;s real estate investment technique: The author introduces the real estate investment strategy of the Philippines\u0026rsquo; richest man, Zheng Zhoumin: buy when the market is down, and hold it for a long time, waiting for the market to recover and prices to rise. Real estate is suitable for debt investment: The author believes that real estate investment is suitable for debt investment because the long-term investment return rate of real estate is usually higher than the loan interest rate. Through reasonable debt investment, financial leverage can be used to magnify returns. At the same time, he also reminds readers to live within their means and avoid the risks brought by excessive debt. Brand concept of real estate investment: The author emphasizes the importance of choosing real estate developers with good brands, guaranteed quality, and good after-sales service. He pointed out that buying a property is a major investment decision, and choosing a reputable developer can reduce investment risks and enhance the living experience. Investment Iron Law 13: Act Now # It is better to act than to sit and study: The author once again emphasizes the importance of action. He believes that having knowledge without taking action is equivalent to not having knowledge. The key to financial management is action, not fantasy. He uses the story of a farmer who does not understand stocks but dares to buy and eventually make a profit as an example to illustrate the importance of action. Future wealth is in your own hands: The author points out that future wealth is in your own hands, and only active actions can create wealth. He encourages readers to overcome their fear and bravely take the first step in financial management. Financial experience - learn from mistakes: The author believes that failure is the mother of success, and you must dare to try and learn from your mistakes. He advises readers to start with small investments, gradually accumulate experience, and gradually improve their risk tolerance. The first step in learning financial management: The author suggests that readers start acting immediately after reading this book. They can start by investing a small amount in stocks or mutual funds, or they can buy a self-occupied property. He believes that the best way to learn financial management is to practice, accumulate experience in practice, and continue to learn and improve. The Ultimate Chapter of Financial Management: Making Money Requires a Goal # Don\u0026rsquo;t be a miser: The author uses the story of a miser to illustrate that money is only a means, and improving the quality of life is the goal. He warns readers not to become slaves to money, to learn to enjoy life, and to use wealth for more meaningful things. What is the purpose of making so much money?: The author explores the meaning and values of money. He pointed out that money itself is not good or bad, the key is how to use it. Money can be used to improve lives, pursue dreams, help others, and give back to society. He encourages readers to establish correct values about money, not to blindly pursue wealth, and ignore other aspects of life. Three secrets of financial management - making money, managing money, and using money: The author proposes three levels of financial management: making money, managing money, and using money. He believes that making money is the foundation, managing money is the key, and using money is the purpose. These three levels are indispensable, and only by combining the three can you truly achieve financial freedom and live a happy life. He pointed out that how to use money is the most difficult because it involves personal values and life goals. American billionaire - Warren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s view of money: The author introduces Warren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s view of money and estate planning. Although Buffett is extremely wealthy, he lives a simple life and donates most of his estate to charity. He believes that happiness is a process, not a result. True happiness lies in constant pursuit and creation, not in how much wealth you have. Summary: The author summarizes the core viewpoints of the book: Everyone can achieve wealth through financial management. The key lies in having the correct concept of financial management, long-term investment, and positive actions. He encourages readers to set clear financial goals and formulate feasible financial plans based on their actual situations. He emphasizes that the ultimate goal of financial management is not to have unlimited wealth, but to achieve financial freedom, improve the quality of life, and ultimately realize the value of life.

person\u0026rsquo;s future wealth the most, is whether they have started managing their finances.\nEveryone Can Achieve Wealth Through Personal Finance\nThis book aims to illustrate a simple truth: investing and managing your finances can not only improve the financial situation of an individual or family, but is also an excellent path to wealth creation. Furthermore, anyone can achieve wealth through personal finance. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to be rich, have a high income, possess a high degree, have specialized knowledge or advanced skills, nor rely on luck. What you need is the desire for wealth, a correct investment philosophy (not just techniques), and the patience to wait for the long term. Therefore, whether a person has money or not, or how high their income is, doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. What truly influences a person\u0026rsquo;s future wealth is whether they have started managing their finances. This endeavor is not easy, but it\u0026rsquo;s undoubtedly worth your effort!\nReaders, please immediately review your current asset allocation. Is too much of your capital sitting in bank accounts or other \u0026ldquo;guaranteed return\u0026rdquo; investments? Is your investment portfolio sufficiently diversified? Do you frequently buy and sell in the stock market?\nAfter understanding your asset allocation, you should earnestly plan your financial goals and follow these five principles:\n1. Clearly define the amount of wealth you hope to achieve and keep it in mind at all times. Simply thinking \u0026ldquo;I want to be rich\u0026rdquo; is not enough.\n2. Set a specific date for achieving your goal.\n3. Determine what price you\u0026rsquo;re willing to pay and what actions you\u0026rsquo;ll take to reach your ideal goal.\n4. Think about your goal at least twice a day to reinforce your belief.\n5. Take action, whether you feel completely ready or not.\nIn Appendix II, readers can use the wealth creation formula and examples provided to calculate how to achieve their financial goals.\nYour future wealth depends on what you do today. Don\u0026rsquo;t let unnecessary hesitation cast a shadow on your heart. As long as you understand investment and financial management, you too can become wealthy in the future. Everyone possesses the necessary ingredients for wealth creation: a small amount of capital and a God-given resource‚Äîtime. As long as you are willing to learn about personal finance, you have the potential to become a multi-millionaire.\nWhen you find people around you feeling lost due to a lack of vision for the future, share with them the \u0026ldquo;¬•14,000 a year for 40 years can make you a multi-millionaire\u0026rdquo; formula and help them reignite their hope.\nFinancial Dependence Is Your Own Responsibility\nThe unequal distribution of wealth in today\u0026rsquo;s society is increasingly severe. Some blame flawed policies, others point to artificial market manipulation. I believe neither is the primary cause. One of the main reasons for the wealth gap is the disparity in financial literacy among people.\nThe reason for poverty in modern times is not so much insufficient income, lack of thrift, or excessive spending, but rather improper financial management. In modern society, achieving financial independence after the age of 40 is a fundamental responsibility for everyone. Whether you want to or not, or whether you like it or not, investment and financial management have become essential knowledge for modern individuals. Remember, with our current income levels and investment opportunities, \u0026ldquo;remaining poor after 40\u0026rdquo; is self-inflicted, and \u0026ldquo;not being a multi-millionaire after 70\u0026rdquo; is due to a lack of financial knowledge.\nAdvances in modern medicine have increased human life expectancy, leading to an aging society. Longer lifespans are a blessing, but enjoying a comfortable retirement is even more crucial. We must accumulate sufficient wealth to secure our lives in old age.\nEffortless Personal Finance, Enjoy the Process\nFrom the examples provided in this article, we can see that those who are good at managing their finances understand how to invest their assets in stocks and real estate with high long-term returns, and they avoid unnecessary short-term trading, thus achieving wealth with ease. Those who are not good at managing their finances either focus solely on saving and keeping their assets in \u0026ldquo;safe\u0026rdquo; bank deposits or try to get rich quickly by engaging in short-term trading in the stock or futures markets. These individuals will eventually be left far behind in the race for financial success.\nMost people keep their assets in financial institutions without investing them, and when they do start investing, they aim for quick riches. As a result, their money stagnates in banks, and their pursuit of quick wealth often leads to substantial losses. They fail to realize that with a little courage, by investing in stocks and real estate and patiently waiting for decades, they can naturally achieve wealth.\nSimply put, building wealth through personal finance only requires two things: investing your capital in areas with high returns and having the patience to wait for the long term. The required investment is low, the probability of success is high, and the process is relaxed and enjoyable.\nI advise readers not to rush to get rich through investment, causing anxiety and ultimately achieving the opposite of what they desire. By following the methods described in this book, you can achieve financial success without expending excessive time and energy, allowing you to focus on your existing career.\nPersonal finance is a marathon, not a sprint. If you view the entire process from a long-term perspective, temporary setbacks don\u0026rsquo;t signify failure, and momentary gains don\u0026rsquo;t guarantee lasting success. With this mindset, you can maintain a more open perspective and avoid becoming overly attached to gains and losses.\nI admit that consistently buying assets and holding them long-term can make personal finance seem dull and unbearable. However, before engaging in any financial activities, investors must clarify their objectives: is it to build wealth or to seek the thrill of gambling? Personal finance can not only lead to wealth but also bring joy and knowledge. Everyone should learn how to manage their finances and find enjoyment in the process.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Feel Guilty About Being Wealthy\nWealth should be acquired and used ethically. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to apologize to others for your wealth. Only the pursuit of wealth through unscrupulous means is sinful and unfortunate. Therefore, everyone should not only be confident but also feel obligated to earn wealth. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to be secretive or ashamed about pursuing wealth. On the contrary, being financially dependent is a burden on society. Moreover, wealthy individuals are more capable of contributing to society. In short, if you can\u0026rsquo;t find a good reason why getting rich is bad, why not allow yourself to become wealthy?\nYou earning more in the investment market doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean others will earn less or lose more. If everyone is proficient in managing their finances, not only can individuals prosper, but economic resources can also be utilized effectively, leading to rapid overall economic growth. In a market economy, the wealth of society is built upon the wealth of its people. Only a prosperous populace can create a prosperous economy.\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s financially driven world, whether for personal advancement or the benefit of society as a whole, everyone should strengthen their understanding of personal finance. When everyone is skilled in managing their finances, individuals and families can live prosperous lives, the wealth gap can be narrowed, and the nation can progress and flourish.\nAction Speaks Louder Than Words\n\u0026ldquo;Knowing and not doing is not knowing.\u0026rdquo; The biggest obstacle to personal finance is not that it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to do, but that it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to start. The key to overcoming this is to act immediately. One of the main reasons for failure in personal finance is avoiding decisions. However, if you want to achieve your goal of building wealth through investment, there\u0026rsquo;s no other way than to take action.\nAfter reading the basic principles of investment and financial management outlined in this article, you should understand that building wealth is not only achievable but also not difficult. So, act now! Time is money. The earlier you start, the sooner you\u0026rsquo;ll reach your financial goals and share the fruits of your labor with your family.\nLooking ahead, changes in society, politics, economics, and finance will accelerate, and the resulting redistribution of wealth will inevitably follow suit. For yourself, your family, and society as a whole, managing your finances is a role everyone should embrace.\nPersistence Is Key\nFor readers seeking quick riches, this book might disappoint you. A more accurate title would be: \u0026ldquo;How to Invest and Manage Your Finances to Slowly but Steadily Build Wealth.\u0026rdquo;\nMany believe that successful people are infallible‚Äînever failing, never experiencing losses. Many also think they must be omniscient and possess sufficient knowledge before they can start investing and managing their finances. Our most common flaw is our unwillingness to try repeatedly and to persevere. Building wealth through personal finance is not difficult! The reason most people don\u0026rsquo;t achieve their goals is their inability to persevere and their lack of patience.\nPersistence is essential for success in personal finance. Suppose you embark on a wealth-building plan and encounter setbacks along the way. Don\u0026rsquo;t be discouraged. Some people regularly save and invest annually. When prices rise, they are satisfied and continue their plan. But when prices fall, they panic and abandon their investment strategy. They fail to understand that price fluctuations are inherent in the investment market, and investment results will inevitably fluctuate.\nIf, midway through your financial plan, you succumb to the temptation to spend your investment capital or give up due to repeated setbacks, all your previous efforts will be wasted. Success in personal finance depends on endurance and resolve: endurance to delay gratification and resist immediate consumption temptations; and resolve to withstand significant wealth fluctuations over long periods without losing your composure. As long as you have perseverance and resolve, trust in compound interest, and believe in the \u0026ldquo;wealth creation formula,\u0026rdquo; the ultimate wealth will undoubtedly be yours.\n\u0026ldquo;No dreams, no wealth.\u0026rdquo; Those who build wealth through personal finance must be driven by desire and ambition. They also need sufficient courage, knowledge, patience, and perseverance. A lack of courage, flawed methods, impatience, or giving up halfway will not work. Whether you can achieve wealth and financial independence in the future depends entirely on your actions and efforts today.\nUnlock Your Hidden Wealth Potential\nBelieve it or not, the price of living a wealthy and successful life is no greater than the price of living a poor and miserable one. Achieving this depends entirely on wisdom, belief, and action. After reading this book, readers should understand that everyone can achieve wealth through personal finance. The reason most people are not wealthy is not due to low income, but rather a lack of understanding of how to create wealth through investment and financial management. The primary purpose of this book is to help everyone unlock their hidden wealth potential.\nIf, after reading this book, you still cannot effectively apply these investment principles to manage your money and improve your financial situation, then this book is a complete failure. Financial education is not merely about imparting knowledge; its significance lies in genuinely changing the reader\u0026rsquo;s financial behavior.\nThis is a book of action, not a textbook for enhancing investment knowledge or a \u0026ldquo;decorative book\u0026rdquo; for your bookshelf. This book aims to inspire readers to change their mindset and behavior. Its success depends on readers taking action based on the core principles presented, breaking free from mediocrity, and embarking on the path to wealth. Therefore, at the end of most chapters, key points are summarized for readers to reflect upon and apply.\nInvestment and financial management can not only lead to wealth but also bring joy to investors. Everyone should learn how to manage their finances and reap the substantial rewards. I believe most readers already possess the basic requirements for building wealth: a small amount of capital, sufficient time, and the investment knowledge gained from this book. The world of personal finance, full of changes and opportunities, awaits you. It is filled with treasures and pitfalls. Don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate, and don\u0026rsquo;t leave empty-handed.\nThe principles of building wealth through investment and financial management are neither profound nor mysterious. They are absolutely achievable for everyone, and many have indeed easily become wealthy through these methods. As we\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned before, \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re willing to learn, managing your finances is as simple as walking.\u0026rdquo;\nAmong the financial principles presented in this book, you\u0026rsquo;ll find many that contradict deeply ingrained investment concepts and financial habits, and some even go against human nature. Therefore, to realize the ideal of wealth creation through investment and financial management, the first step is to break free from some \u0026ldquo;deep-rooted and misguided\u0026rdquo; investment concepts, common knowledge, and habits. Almost none of these concepts and principles are easy to achieve. Therefore, I advise readers to not only read each chapter carefully but also to review, reflect, establish strict rules, and ultimately change their behavior.\nWealth Is a Means to a Better Life\nFinally, this book must emphasize that wealth is not the purpose of life, but a means to create a better life. The ultimate goal of investment and financial management is not just to become rich, but to use wealth to realize your life\u0026rsquo;s aspirations. Therefore, a fulfilling and balanced life is the starting point for personal finance.\nEveryone should actively and optimistically plan and execute their lifelong financial journey. Based on the principles we\u0026rsquo;ve presented, everyone can achieve substantial wealth through personal finance without sacrificing time, energy, work, or life. However, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to remember that only those who balance career, life, health, family, and wealth can be considered truly successful in managing their finances. Those who gain the world\u0026rsquo;s riches but lose their health, family, and the meaning of life cannot be considered truly successful. In today\u0026rsquo;s society, many are lost in the pursuit of wealth, sacrificing more valuable things in life. Therefore, this principle of balancing personal finance and life is particularly important and deserves careful consideration.\nAlthough this book repeatedly emphasizes that success in personal finance depends on mindset, time, and action, not luck, I still congratulate you, the reader, on being fortunate enough to encounter this book. By adhering to the investment principles within, you are sure to become a multi-millionaire in the decades to come!\n","date":"15 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005974/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Conclusion","type":"posts"},{"content":" The Ultimate Guide to Wealth Management: Earning Money Requires a Goal # Money is merely a means; improving the quality of life is the ultimate goal. Success is getting what you want, then enjoying what you have.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Be a Miser # A miser sold all his possessions, deposited the money in a bank, and took great satisfaction in calculating his daily interest earnings. His unscrupulous son, noticing his father\u0026rsquo;s secretive behavior, discovered the large bank deposit. He stole the passbook and seal, withdrew all the money, and replaced the original with a forgery. The miser, unaware of the deception, continued to calculate his imaginary wealth and interest.\nNot Spending Money Is Like Having No Money\nMonths later, a sudden urge led the miser to the bank, where he discovered his account was empty. Devastated, he returned home, where his son consoled him: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be so upset. Just pretend the passbook is real. It serves the same purpose. You can still calculate your wealth daily. Money sitting unused in a bank is the same as having no money.\u0026rdquo; This parable satirizes the miser to emphasize the true meaning of wealth. Hoarding money without utilizing it is no different from having none. Wealth, in any form, has no inherent meaning. Its value comes from what we ascribe to it and how we use it to live the life we want.\n\u0026ldquo;My philosophy is to live a simple life, be humble, and what significance does money hold for me?\u0026rdquo; Li Ka-shing, despite his immense wealth, focuses on making more money and training his successors ‚Äì his two sons, Victor and Richard.\nWealthy Taiwanese tycoons seem to follow a similar pattern, leaving all their wealth to the next generation, even surpassing Li Ka-shing in their simple lifestyles. Tsai Wan-lin, once Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s richest man, drove a Yulon car and ate nutritionally balanced but bland meals prepared by doctors. Even in his 70s, he went to work every day, saying, \u0026ldquo;The thought of paying NT$20 million in salaries every day compels me to come to the office.\u0026rdquo;\nTaiwan has many such \u0026ldquo;miserly\u0026rdquo; tycoons. Wang Yung-ching, the founder of Formosa Plastics Group, was known for his frugality, even combining leftover soap scraps. He said, \u0026ldquo;Food needs only to be nutritious, not necessarily luxurious. Simple meals are good. Constant luxury makes one forget what happiness is.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can live like an emperor or a commoner,\u0026rdquo; said Huang Shih-hui, chairman of the Chinfon Group and a consistent top taxpayer in Taiwan. \u0026ldquo;Even if I lost a third, or even half of my wealth, I could still live well.\u0026rdquo; Ranked Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s sixth richest man by Fortune magazine, Huang ate NT$50 lunches and drove an ordinary car. He said, \u0026ldquo;How much can I wear? How much can I eat? Excessive desire will kill you!\u0026rdquo; For these wealthy individuals, the meaning of earning so much lies in the sense of accomplishment, not enjoyment.\nBe the Master of Your Money\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t master your money, your money will master you.\nIf asked, \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the next step after earning money?\u0026rdquo; most people would instinctively answer, \u0026ldquo;Spending it!\u0026rdquo; They\u0026rsquo;re wrong. Those who answer this way usually haven\u0026rsquo;t earned much. Most self-made millionaires continue to earn after becoming wealthy.\nSome might say, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s foolish to have money and not spend it!\u0026rdquo; True, but such misers are not uncommon. Studies show that at least 90% of people continue to accumulate wealth, becoming slaves to money.\nBy now, you should realize that achieving financial wealth is relatively easy. Avoid keeping all your money in the bank, invest most of it in stocks or real estate, and be patient. However, teaching you to become a billionaire only to become a miserly hoarder is not my intention. Therefore, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to discuss the meaning of wealth and the reasons for pursuing it.\nUndeniably, with today\u0026rsquo;s opportunities and living standards, hard work can ensure a comfortable life. This book demonstrates that with proper financial management, wealth is attainable. However, without prior reflection on the meaning of wealth, you may become complacent, give up, or, even worse, become wealthy but not know how to use your money. This benefits no one. Before embarking on the path to riches, ask yourself what wealth means to you, then determine the steps to achieve it.\n1. Don\u0026rsquo;t be a miser. Learn to spend wisely after earning. 2. Before pursuing wealth, understand your values regarding it.\nMoney, a double-edged sword, has corrupted countless souls throughout history. Poverty, a solitary grave, has buried countless heroes and talents.\nWhy Earn So Much? # Everyone desires wealth. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that why you bought and are reading this book? Yet, not everyone prioritizes wealth. We often hear sentiments like: \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t take it with you,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Wealth is fleeting,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;One can only eat three meals a day, wear one outfit, and one pair of shoes. Why earn so much?\u0026rdquo;\nIf you say, \u0026ldquo;Why bother with financial management if you don\u0026rsquo;t want wealth?\u0026rdquo; I have nothing more to say. This book is explicitly for those seeking financial independence and wealth.\nThe desire for wealth is a personal choice, determined by one\u0026rsquo;s values and perspective on money. Some see it as a tool, content with enough to meet their needs; others view it as the root of all evil, associating the pursuit of wealth with something ignoble. Undeniably, the single-minded pursuit of money is wrong. Life offers many other valuable pursuits: health, knowledge, family, love, friendship ‚Äì all precious.\nMoney isn\u0026rsquo;t everything. We often hear, \u0026ldquo;If money can solve it, it\u0026rsquo;s a simple problem.\u0026rdquo; While not the most important thing in life, its importance is undeniable. As the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;Money isn\u0026rsquo;t everything, but without it, you can do nothing.\u0026rdquo; A good life requires money, as does education, a higher quality of life, improving family life, and even philanthropy. The New England Journal of Medicine points out that the wealthy live longer, healthier lives than the poor.\nMany aspire to a happy life and giving back to society. Both require money. Thus, money is a necessary means to achieve life goals. You can disdain money, but you can\u0026rsquo;t deny its utility in today\u0026rsquo;s society.\nOne\u0026rsquo;s status and worth are often judged by wealth. It\u0026rsquo;s unfair, but true. Despite the absence of social classes, money divides people into \u0026ldquo;rich\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;poor.\u0026rdquo; Greater wealth translates to greater ability to acquire desired possessions, status, and lifestyles.\nMoney undoubtedly buys the best healthcare, food, clothing, and housing. It provides security and freedom from fear, improving the quality of life and making it more vibrant. The poor have limited options, while the rich enjoy a wider range of experiences.\nMoney Can Ruin the Next Generation\nThe easiest way to ruin your children? Leave them a fortune. The saying \u0026ldquo;Wealth doesn\u0026rsquo;t last three generations\u0026rdquo; reflects this truth.\nMany educators and I share a common experience: the most challenging students lack motivation, often stemming from wealthy backgrounds. These children, wanting for nothing, don\u0026rsquo;t understand the need for hard work or ambition.\nI recall a case during my tenure as director of the Graduate Institute of Business Administration at Tunghai University. A student, admitted after fierce competition, struggled academically and seemed listless. During counseling, I inquired about learning difficulties.\nHis response: \u0026ldquo;My engineering background makes these courses easy. I don\u0026rsquo;t understand why I need to learn this.\u0026rdquo; I explained that business school teaches profit maximization. He replied, \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the point of making money?\u0026rdquo; Shocked, I learned that his family\u0026rsquo;s wealth had shielded him from financial concerns, leaving him without a drive to earn. I then emphasized the value of business management for future employment. His response: \u0026ldquo;My father owns a factory waiting for me, but I don\u0026rsquo;t want it.\u0026rdquo; He didn\u0026rsquo;t appreciate what he already had. I asked about his apparent preoccupation. Reluctantly, he confessed his biggest worry: \u0026ldquo;Why can humans kill animals, but not the other way around?\u0026rdquo; I truly didn\u0026rsquo;t understand the mindset of the wealthy\u0026rsquo;s offspring. It reminded me of the Taiwanese saying: \u0026ldquo;Some complain of hunger after a full meal.\u0026rdquo;\nWe should be grateful if our parents didn\u0026rsquo;t leave us a fortune that robbed us of our drive. This book shows how financial management can lead to wealth. However, I caution against leaving excessive wealth to your children.\nIdeally, set a financial goal and stop actively pursuing wealth after reaching it. Avoid becoming a lifelong slave to money, and don\u0026rsquo;t ruin your children\u0026rsquo;s future.\nWarren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s Perspective on Money\nBillionaire Warren Buffett has arranged his estate to be managed by a trust controlled by wise individuals with absolute authority and no restrictions. He avoids preconditions, hoping to prevent it from becoming a bureaucratic, traditional fund. He said, \u0026ldquo;If they create a lofty palace and become conservative and closed-minded, my ghost will not let them rest.\u0026rdquo;\nBuffett left his children $3 million each, and they now live happily as farmers. I admire his perspective: \u0026ldquo;True happiness isn\u0026rsquo;t living in a palace but adding a room to your house each year, because happiness is a process, not a result.\u0026rdquo;\nBuffett\u0026rsquo;s estate planning is unique. As America\u0026rsquo;s richest man, his financial decisions draw attention. Some criticize his perceived stinginess towards philanthropy. He countered, \u0026ldquo;When I die, societal problems will remain. Society will benefit more from my wealth then than now.\u0026rdquo; He remains steadfast despite public opinion.\nBuffett essentially ensures that his wealth, acquired from society, returns to it upon his death ‚Äì a remarkably detached approach compared to many Eastern tycoons.\nAcquiring wealth is difficult. Maintaining wealth is harder. Utilizing wealth is the hardest.\nThe Three Keys to Wealth Management: Earning, Managing, and Utilizing # Wealth management comprises three levels: earning, managing, and utilizing money. Technically, earning is the hardest, followed by managing, then utilizing. However, my experience as a financial advisor suggests that teaching people how to earn is difficult, teaching them to manage is harder, and teaching them to utilize is the hardest.\nFew Spend Wisely\nSome challenge this: \u0026ldquo;Spending is easy! Give me your money, and I\u0026rsquo;ll spend it all quickly.\u0026rdquo; True, spending other people\u0026rsquo;s money is easy; spending your life\u0026rsquo;s earnings is not. Many wealthy individuals struggle to use their money meaningfully.\nMany lifelong savers find it incredibly difficult to change their habits and spend appropriately, even after becoming wealthy. When asked, \u0026ldquo;What are you saving for?\u0026rdquo; they often reply, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo;\nMany people tirelessly pursue wealth without clarifying their goals. They blindly follow the mantra \u0026ldquo;Money is important.\u0026rdquo; No one takes their wealth to the grave. Many become so consumed with earning that they forget their initial purpose, mistaking the means for the end. They fail to use their wealth for greater happiness, joy, or societal good, becoming slaves to money. Their wealth becomes meaningless, bringing more harm than benefit.\n1. Money is a means to achieve life goals. Don\u0026rsquo;t mistake the means for the end and blindly chase money. 2. Learn to utilize your money to become a truly happy and wealthy individual. 3. Save when young, manage wisely in middle age, and spend thoughtfully in old age.\nThe Wealth Journey of Chen Ding-chuan, Chairman of Everlight Chemical\n\u0026ldquo;Before seeking wealth, cultivate the ability to manage money and control yourself.\u0026rdquo; Chen Ding-chuan believes that those who don\u0026rsquo;t understand how to use money become its slaves, losing themselves in the pursuit. Those who master the art of utilizing money become its masters, prioritizing self-growth and attracting wealth naturally.\nChen founded Everlight Chemical at 40, transforming it from a producer of basic dyes to a supplier of advanced specialty chemicals and pharmaceutical ingredients. By 1995, the company\u0026rsquo;s revenue reached over NT$2.4 billion. A devout Christian and former director of the International Foundation Taiwan, Chen holds a unique perspective on money. He believes earning is easy, but spending wisely is not. He\u0026rsquo;s witnessed countless wealthy individuals squander their fortunes and lose themselves, while others hoard their wealth, living like paupers and inflicting misery on those around them. He believes most people don\u0026rsquo;t understand how to use money.\nDeeply religious, Chen dedicates himself to God and spreading the Gospel. Despite his success, he\u0026rsquo;s traveled a difficult path. He left school after elementary to work, studying diligently at night school for seven years, never missing a class except due to illness. While others took on extra jobs, he prioritized education, graduating with a degree in international trade at 35. Who would have predicted his future as a billionaire?\nWho Paid the Highest Estate Tax?\n\u0026ldquo;Who paid the highest estate tax in Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s history?\u0026rdquo; I often ask this during lectures. Few know the correct answer: Chen De-shen.\n\u0026ldquo;Chen De-shen? Who is he?\u0026rdquo; Audiences always murmur after the reveal. It\u0026rsquo;s a shame that someone who paid nearly NT$2 billion in estate tax remains relatively unknown. How? The only explanation is that Chen mastered earning and managing money, but not utilizing it.\nChen died in 1991, leaving an estate valued at NT$10 billion, resulting in a record NT$1.9 billion estate tax bill. He lived a remarkably frugal life, using public transportation, sleeping on a cot, and living in his office to avoid buying a house. His sister recounted how he even refused to replace worn-out underwear.\nUnmarried and childless, his vast fortune went to his siblings, sparking a highly publicized inheritance dispute. He exemplifies the saying, \u0026ldquo;Those enslaved by wealth are pitiable even in their riches.\u0026rdquo;\nI often wonder, had he allocated a portion of his wealth to establish a \u0026ldquo;De-shen College\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;De-shen Hospital,\u0026rdquo; or donated even 1% (NT$100 million) to Tunghai University\u0026rsquo;s business school, his name would be remembered for generations. Such philanthropy would have benefited society and avoided family conflict.\nStanford University, a prestigious institution nestled between San Francisco and Silicon Valley, owes its existence to a generous donation from the Stanford family a century ago. What a profound and lasting impact! We marvel at the wisdom and foresight behind such giving.\n","date":"15 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005973/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Wealth Management","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"15 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/quality-of-life/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Quality of Life","type":"tags"},{"content":" Appendix 1: Understanding Compound Interest # Accumulating wealth isn\u0026rsquo;t about cutting expenses,\nbut about the compounding power of money making money.\nAlbert Einstein, considered one of history\u0026rsquo;s greatest scientists, was once asked, \u0026ldquo;What is the most powerful force in the world?\u0026rdquo; His answer wasn\u0026rsquo;t the force of colliding planets or the power of a nuclear explosion, but \u0026ldquo;compound interest.\u0026rdquo;\nAs the previous examples demonstrate, the factor that allows a yearly saving of 14,000 yuan to grow to over 100 million yuan in 40 years is \u0026ldquo;compound interest.\u0026rdquo; Since compound interest is the primary driver of accelerated wealth growth, understanding it is crucial for achieving financial success.\nImagine two job offers: one with a monthly salary of 100,000 yuan, and another starting at 1 yuan in the first month, doubling each subsequent month. Assuming both jobs last two years (24 months), which would you choose?\nAt first glance, the first offer seems better. 100,000 yuan monthly yields 2.4 million yuan over 24 months. However, anyone understanding compound interest would choose the second job, which yields over 16.77 million yuan after 24 months! This is the effect of compounding. While this is an extreme example, such high growth rates are unlikely in reality. Nevertheless, it clearly demonstrates the power of compound interest.\nMost people have a basic understanding of compound interest. Depositing money in a bank generates interest over time, a common understanding in modern society. Since Einstein considered compound interest the most powerful force, and it can help us become millionaires with modest investments, a deeper understanding of its workings is essential, especially for those interested in financial management.\nSimply put, compound interest is \u0026ldquo;interest on interest.\u0026rdquo; We know bank deposits earn interest, calculated using compound interest. For instance, with a 10% interest rate, a 1,000 yuan deposit earns 100 yuan in interest in the first year, resulting in 1,100 yuan. If left in the bank, the second year\u0026rsquo;s interest is 110 yuan (on 1,100 yuan), totaling 1,210 yuan. The third year yields 121 yuan in interest, reaching 1,331 yuan.\nNotice the increasing interest earned each year. This is because the first year\u0026rsquo;s interest earns interest in the second year, and so on, leading to an ever-increasing return. This \u0026ldquo;interest on interest\u0026rdquo; phenomenon is compound interest.\nThe table below shows that after the 26th year, the annual interest earned surpasses the principal, and by the 40th year, the interest of 4,114 yuan is more than four times the initial 1,000 yuan principal.\nFuture Value of 1,000 Yuan at 10% Interest Rate (Compounded Annually)\nYear Beginning Value Ending Value Interest 1 1000 1100 100 2 1100 1210 110 3 1210 1331 121 \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 26 10835 11918 1083 \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 39 37404 41145 3740 40 41145 45259 4114 Compound interest\u0026rsquo;s effect varies with different interest rates and durations. These variations are presented in compound interest tables (refer to this appendix). These tables, composed of interest rates, years, and future value factors (the growth multiplier calculated by the formula), might seem daunting with their numerous figures. However, understanding them is invaluable for investment and financial management. Renowned American financial advisor Venita VanCaspel calls the compound interest table the \u0026ldquo;eighth wonder of the world.\u0026rdquo; If you don\u0026rsquo;t have the opportunity to travel the world, studying this table can be just as rewarding. Understanding the characteristics of compound interest is key to leveraging its power for wealth creation.\nThe compound interest table reveals that the values increase with time and interest rate. However, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the whole story. Observing compound interest graphs derived from these tables reveals further insights. Figure 1-1 assumes a yearly deposit of 1 yuan at different interest rates, plotting asset growth over 10 years. Figure 1-2 uses the same assumptions but extends the time horizon to 40 years.\nFigure 1-1: Future Value Growth of 1 Yuan Annuity at Different Interest Rates over 10 Years\nFigure 1-2: Future Value Growth of 1 Yuan Annuity at Different Interest Rates over 40 Years\nThese graphs illustrate the growth of 1 yuan over time at various interest rates and durations. Comparing them reveals two key characteristics of compound interest:\nAs the duration (time) increases, the future value rises continuously, and the rate of increase accelerates. This is known as exponential growth. Given sufficient time, the growth becomes dramatic, with the curve eventually approaching a straight upward line. Different interest rates result in significantly different growth curves. Over decades, the disparity between high and low interest rate curves becomes immense. In summary, the secret to accumulating significant wealth from small beginnings lies in leveraging the \u0026ldquo;money making money\u0026rdquo; power of compound interest. Compounding has two key features: its effect is more pronounced over longer periods, and higher returns amplify its impact. Applying these principles to investing leads to two conclusions:\nInvest in high-return assets like stocks and real estate. Higher returns maximize the effect of compounding, while low returns yield minimal benefits. To fully harness the power of compound interest, capital must be invested in high-return assets. Hold investments long-term. The longer the investment horizon, the more significant the compounding effect. Short-term investments don\u0026rsquo;t allow sufficient time for compounding to work its magic. Therefore, long-term holdings in high-return assets are crucial for maximizing the benefits of compound interest. Appendix 2: Blueprint for Financial Success # Everyone\u0026rsquo;s age, personality, and applicable tax rates differ. Therefore, each individual needs a tailored approach to wealth accumulation. I can\u0026rsquo;t provide personalized financial planning advice based on your specific circumstances, nor can I encompass everyone\u0026rsquo;s financial situation and plans with a few generic examples.\nTo help you design your own \u0026ldquo;Blueprint for Financial Success,\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve combined the future value and annuity future value formulas from finance to create a universal \u0026ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula.\u0026rdquo; This formula empowers readers to plan their lifelong financial strategies based on their unique circumstances and objectives.\nFuture Wealth=Current Wealth√ó(1+R)n+Annual Savings√ó(1+R)n‚àí1R=Current Wealth√óFuture Value Factor+Annual Savings√óAnnuity Future Value FactorWhere:n:Number of yearsR:Average annual investment rate of return\nThe values for the complex calculations in the formula above (Future Value Factor and Annuity Future Value Factor) can be found in Appendix 1 of this book.\nFuture Value Factor: The future value of 1 yuan today, after N years, at an interest rate (or rate of return) of R%. Annuity Future Value Factor: The future value of an annuity of 1 yuan deposited at the end of each year, after N years, at an interest rate (or rate of return) of R%. Using this formula, you can project your future wealth by inputting your current assets, average annual savings for investment, planned investment period, and expected annual rate of return. You can calculate the result or look it up in a table.\nThis formula simplifies the real-world situation, as investment returns are unlikely to remain constant each year, and annual savings might fluctuate. However, using the \u0026ldquo;average\u0026rdquo; annual rate of return and \u0026ldquo;average\u0026rdquo; annual investment amount generally provides a reasonable approximation of future wealth.\nThe purpose of the \u0026ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t to predict future wealth precisely but to illustrate how investment builds wealth and how financial management leads to prosperity. It aims to bolster your confidence in financial planning, enabling you to focus on key principles, maintain perseverance, and steadily progress towards your financial goals throughout market fluctuations.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t a foolproof formula for riches. Following this method may lead to becoming a millionaire, but success isn\u0026rsquo;t guaranteed. However, inaction guarantees zero chance of success. The most valuable aspect of this wealth-building concept is the message: \u0026ldquo;Investment and financial management can lead to wealth.\u0026rdquo; This knowledge fosters optimism and hope. Regardless of your current wealth, age, annual savings, or investment skills, with dedication, determination, and a willingness to learn, you can leverage investing to grow your wealth.\nAfter understanding this formula, follow these steps for financial planning:\nI. Data Collection:\nWhat is your current total asset value? (Include bank deposits, stocks, real estate, etc.) How much do you anticipate saving annually for investment? What is your expected average annual investment rate of return? How many years do you plan to invest before reaching your financial goal? What is your future wealth target? II. Calculation and Analysis:\nUse the five data points above with the \u0026ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula\u0026rdquo; to assess the feasibility of your wealth plan. If it\u0026rsquo;s not feasible, how will you adjust? Will you increase savings? Improve investment skills to boost returns? Lower your wealth target? Or extend your time horizon? Adjust the variables and recalculate until you find a realistic and achievable plan. Calculate your projected accumulated wealth based on your current assets, investment period, annual savings, and expected rate of return. You can also use any four of the five variables (current wealth, target year, annual savings, rate of return, wealth target) to calculate the remaining variable. (Calculating the target year or rate of return using the other four variables requires a financial calculator or trial and error to find an approximate value.) While the \u0026ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula\u0026rdquo; involves a seemingly complex mathematical formula, its primary purpose is to explain the principles of wealth building, not to complicate financial management or confuse readers. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a calculator or prefer not to delve into the formula\u0026rsquo;s calculations, feel free to disregard it.\nUsing the \u0026ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula\u0026rdquo; can help you plan your future finances and boost your confidence in financial management. However, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee investment success. Pre-planning is just the beginning; the key lies in mastering investment principles and consistent action. When starting your financial journey, clarify your financial situation, set realistic wealth goals, then use the \u0026ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula\u0026rdquo; to evaluate your investment strategy and timeline. Remember, the path to wealth is in your hands.\nExample: Zhang San is 30 years old with 200,000 yuan in savings. After reading this book, he resolves to become a millionaire (meaning having 100 million yuan). He plans to invest 100,000 yuan annually in stocks and real estate with an expected 20% annual return, aiming to reach his goal by age 50. Let\u0026rsquo;s use the \u0026ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula\u0026rdquo; to assess the feasibility.\nFuture Wealth=200,000√ó(1+20%)20+100,000√ó(1+20%)20‚àí120%=200,000√ó38.338+100,000√ó228.98(Corrected Annuity Factor)=30,435,600(Corrected Calculation)\nBased on the calculation, Zhang San\u0026rsquo;s 200,000 yuan initial investment, along with 100,000 yuan annual investments over 20 years at a 20% average return, will yield approximately 26 million yuan, less than one-third of his 100 million yuan goal. To become a millionaire, he can improve his return, increase his annual investment, or extend his time horizon. A 20% return is already quite good and realistic, even for seasoned investors. Increasing his returns further might be challenging. Since he doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to extend the timeline, he decides to increase his annual investment. Through frugality and a part-time job, he manages to save 200,000 yuan annually. Let\u0026rsquo;s recalculate his future wealth after 20 years.\nFuture Wealth=200000√ó(1+20%)20+200000√ó(1+20%)2020%‚àí1=200000√ó38.338+200000√ó186.96=45005600\nEven with doubled annual savings, his wealth after 20 years still falls short of half his goal. With both his 20% return and 200,000 yuan annual investment maxed out, he has to extend his timeline. He decides to aim for 25 years. Let\u0026rsquo;s calculate his projected wealth then.\nFuture Wealth=200000√ó(1+20%)25+200000√ó(1+20%)2520%‚àí1=200000√ó95.396+200000√ó471.98=113475200\nHe finally achieves his goal of becoming a millionaire after 25 years. Extending the timeline by just five years makes a significant difference. With a longer time horizon, his required annual investment could be even lower. This example validates the book\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on \u0026ldquo;youth being an asset in wealth building\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;the importance of long-term investing for realizing the power of compound interest.\u0026rdquo; Experiment with different variables to understand their impact. You\u0026rsquo;ll discover that the initial wealth and annual investment amount have a relatively small impact, while time and rate of return are the key drivers of wealth accumulation.\nYour circumstances might be better or worse than Zhang San\u0026rsquo;s. Regardless, everyone has different starting points, but anyone can become a millionaire. Calculate your own path to becoming a millionaire based on your current situation. Remember, with a modest initial investment, allocation to high-return assets like stocks and real estate, and long-term holding, becoming a millionaire is absolutely achievable.\nNow, set your financial goal. Write down your target wealth, your desired timeline, and how you plan to use your wealth to achieve your broader life goals.\nRemember: \u0026ldquo;Money is a means to an end, not the end itself.\u0026rdquo;\nAccumulating more money isn\u0026rsquo;t always better, and having more financial goals isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily advantageous. Such an approach may prevent you from ever reaching your goals and trap you in a cycle of dissatisfaction and greed. You could become a slave to money and potentially harm future generations with excessive wealth, contributing nothing to yourself, your loved ones, or society.\nOnce you have a financial goal, use the \u0026ldquo;Wealth Formula\u0026rdquo; to calculate your path, including required annual savings and average rate of return.

They envied others who invested in stocks, real estate, or other ventures and became wealthy. They lamented, \u0026ldquo;We toil all day, earning so little, while those investors make easy money.\u0026rdquo; Finally, they decided to seek guidance from an investment guru.\nKnowledge Without Action is Useless\nTouched by their sincerity, the guru agreed to teach them. The first lesson was \u0026ldquo;Investment Principles,\u0026rdquo; covering compound interest, returns, and risk management. The second lesson was \u0026ldquo;Investment Practice,\u0026rdquo; where the guru demonstrated how to invest in stocks, real estate, and other assets. He then asked, \u0026ldquo;Do you understand?\u0026rdquo; They all replied, \u0026ldquo;Yes!\u0026rdquo; The guru said, \u0026ldquo;Congratulations, you\u0026rsquo;ve graduated!\u0026rdquo; The group rejoiced and returned to their jobs.\nDecades later, at a reunion, they complained, \u0026ldquo;Is there any way to make good money? Why do we always have to work so hard?\u0026rdquo; They revisited the guru, who asked, \u0026ldquo;Where did you put your earnings?\u0026rdquo; They answered, \u0026ldquo;In bank savings accounts.\u0026rdquo;\nThis story illustrates that education can change thinking but not necessarily behavior. Possessing knowledge and wisdom without action is no different from lacking them; you\u0026rsquo;ll still rely on physical labor and skills for a living. Wisdom without action is useless; one must be willing to act.\nA survey of wealthy Americans revealed that one of their key traits is \u0026ldquo;proactive action.\u0026rdquo; In other words, financial success depends on what we do, not what we know.\nInvestment professors sometimes face student skepticism: \u0026ldquo;If you know so much, why aren\u0026rsquo;t you rich from investing?\u0026rdquo; A common response is, \u0026ldquo;A teacher\u0026rsquo;s duty is to impart knowledge, not necessarily to practice it. Just like the best coach isn\u0026rsquo;t always the best athlete.\u0026rdquo;\nI often ponder this: Many teachers desire wealth. Wealth accumulation and educating the next generation aren\u0026rsquo;t mutually exclusive. Why don\u0026rsquo;t most investment professors, armed with financial knowledge, become wealthy?\nAnother common question is: \u0026ldquo;Some uneducated, idle speculators get rich through investing without ever taking an investment course. How?\u0026rdquo; The difference between professors and these speculators is simple: some professors know but don\u0026rsquo;t act, while speculators act but don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily know. Financial knowledge alone doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee wealth; action is key.\nAction is the Key to Investment Success\nCan investment skills be taught? No. True skill comes from practice. I often compare investing to ice skating, swimming, or cycling. Can reading books on \u0026ldquo;How to Ice Skate\u0026rdquo; make you a skater? The best teacher is experience ‚Äì falling hundreds of times, getting back up, and persevering.\nFear is the biggest obstacle to learning about investing. A student once asked, \u0026ldquo;What if I lose all my money before I learn how to invest?\u0026rdquo; I countered, \u0026ldquo;Did you study fluid dynamics before learning to ride a bike, fearing you\u0026rsquo;d crash before mastering it?\u0026rdquo; Investors must understand that even extensive reading won\u0026rsquo;t prevent losses; just like a perfect score in fluid dynamics doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee perfect cycling.\nPractice and experience are essential for practical skills. Investing can\u0026rsquo;t be taught. The key is to step away from books, enter the market, experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them. Start small with a limited amount of money.\nAchieving wealth through investing involves two stages: 1) acquiring correct investment knowledge, and 2) continuous practice and action. Both are essential. Reading this book and understanding the principles is just the first step.\nKnowledge Becomes Power Through Action\nKnowledge is potential power. Only through absorption, internalization, and action does it become real power. \u0026ldquo;Knowledge is power\u0026rdquo; needs amending.\nCorrect understanding alone is insufficient. Achieving wealth requires consistent action and practice. Otherwise, knowledge remains theoretical. Investing is a skill honed through constant practice, like entrepreneur Wang Yung-ching, who continued massive investments in his 70s.\nWe instinctively avoid risk; it\u0026rsquo;s uncomfortable. But investing for wealth requires calculated risks, learned through experience. Dear reader, action is paramount. Initial fear and anxiety are natural. The best way to overcome them is to act.\n1. Those who put ideas and methods into action possess a competitive edge and grasp the opportunity for success.\n2. In today\u0026rsquo;s knowledge-rich world, the biggest obstacle to success is not knowing what to do, but doing what we know.\n3. Many excel at thinking, analyzing, and identifying opportunities, but few act upon them.\nA Farmer Outperforms Market Veterans\nIn early 1996, amid cross-strait tensions, Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s stock market slumped. A farmer walked into a brokerage, placed a bag of cash (around 3-4 million NTD) on the counter, and said, \u0026ldquo;I want to buy San Shang Yin.\u0026rdquo;\nThe clerk, baffled, asked for his account number, which stock he wanted (San Shang Yin refers to three different bank stocks), and his desired price. He knew none of this, saying only, \u0026ldquo;My friend said San Shang Yin is good. Here\u0026rsquo;s the money.\u0026rdquo;\nThe clerk explained the situation, helped him open an account, and bought 10 shares of each bank stock at around 90 NTD. Two months later, the prices rose to 160 NTD.\nThis farmer, lacking knowledge but daring to act, profited. Meanwhile, market experts who thoroughly analyzed San Shang Yin missed out because they hesitated to act.\nDoes knowledge or action bring wealth? The farmer\u0026rsquo;s lack of knowledge might have been his advantage, while overthinking paralyzed the experts. How much do analysis and knowledge truly contribute to wealth creation? It\u0026rsquo;s worth pondering.\nActive action makes dreams come true. A strong desire for wealth fuels action.\nYour Future Wealth is in Your Hands # Many attendees at my seminars nod in agreement but fail to act. Remember, action, not knowledge, determines your future. This book is useless unless you act upon it.\nDreams Alone Won\u0026rsquo;t Make You Rich\nMany dream of wealth, but few succeed. It\u0026rsquo;s not luck or intelligence, but the unity of thought and action. Success and wealth are earned through planning, action, and consistent effort.\nFor most, wealth is a fantasy. They think and talk, but don\u0026rsquo;t act. Some lack the know-how, which is understandable. Sadly, others know but don\u0026rsquo;t act. \u0026ldquo;Knowing and not doing is not knowing.\u0026rdquo; Wealth won\u0026rsquo;t come to those who only dream or accumulate knowledge without action. People attribute wealth to luck, but does luck favor those dreaming at home or those actively seeking opportunities?\nReading this book won\u0026rsquo;t magically make you rich. Financial success depends on what we do. We\u0026rsquo;ve all seen seemingly unintelligent, not particularly hard-working, or frugal people who are wealthy.\nThe difference between self-made millionaires and us isn\u0026rsquo;t intellect, effort, frugality, or knowledge, but where our money is placed. They invest in high-return assets, while we often settle for low returns. Most make excuses: not enough money, time, knowledge, or opportunity, or blaming age. These are merely excuses preventing wealth accumulation.\n1. The principles of financial management are simple; the difficulty lies in overcoming fear, greed, and laziness to do what we know we should.\n2. Investing is an art and a science, but more art. The best way to learn is by doing.\n3. Without putting money to work, you\u0026rsquo;ll rely on physical labor and skills your entire life.\nThe First Step: Open a Brokerage Account and Buy Stocks\nAn elderly British writer lamented, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve seen many talented young people remain obscure, their potential unfulfilled because they lacked the courage to try. Guidance and encouragement to take risks could have unleashed their talents and benefited society.\u0026rdquo;\nOver 13% of seniors in Taiwan rely on continued work or family support. Many ended up this way because they didn\u0026rsquo;t invest in risky assets like stocks or real estate in their youth. Had they been guided to invest wisely, they could be enjoying retirement, reducing social inequality and promoting harmony.\nInspired by this writer, I now encourage my students to open brokerage accounts and buy stocks (or closed-end funds if unsure) on the first day of my investment courses. I advise them to hold long-term, regardless of price fluctuations, aiming for practical experience over theoretical knowledge.\nPaying for Experience\nIn 1983, while pursuing my PhD at UC Berkeley, a Wall Street analyst lectured at the university. I asked him for book recommendations on stock investing. He advised, \u0026ldquo;The best way to learn is to invest. You\u0026rsquo;ll learn more from one real investment than from several books.\u0026rdquo; I followed his advice, lost money, and learned valuable lessons that shaped my future investment approach.\nFinancial management can\u0026rsquo;t be learned solely in the classroom. Can attending ten lectures on swimming theory and reading ten books on \u0026ldquo;Swimming Secrets\u0026rdquo; make you a swimmer? The first step is to get in the water. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s education system overemphasizes book learning and neglects practical experience.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the first step in learning to invest? Some suggest reading books, subscribing to financial magazines, or taking courses. My advice: after reading this book, invest a small amount in stocks or mutual funds (especially index funds) if unsure.\nMutual funds offer diversification and professional management, generally performing close to market averages, minimizing potential losses and discouraging fear.\nOutperforming mutual funds through individual stock picking is challenging. Fund managers have experience, expertise, and research teams. Consider mutual funds, especially index funds like CTBC Harmony Fund or China 100 Fund, in the initial stages. \u0026ldquo;Beating the index\u0026rdquo; is every fund manager\u0026rsquo;s dream, but most admit it\u0026rsquo;s incredibly difficult. If so, mirroring the market through index funds is a viable strategy.\nIf you have savings and don\u0026rsquo;t own property, consider buying a home as your first investment.\nWe learn more from failure than from success. Success is built upon countless failures.\nLearning from Mistakes # Successful American investors share two traits: 1) they don\u0026rsquo;t strive for perfection, and 2) they don\u0026rsquo;t dwell on failures, focusing instead on future challenges. High returns come with high risks. Failure is inevitable and part of the learning process. Most successful investors have experienced multiple failures.\nNo Success Without Failure\nAnyone claiming to have never lost money in investing is either lying or has never invested. It\u0026rsquo;s like a baseball player claiming to have never missed a swing. Even the best hitters don\u0026rsquo;t have a 100% batting average.\nA top baseball player once attributed his success to \u0026ldquo;missing more swings than others.\u0026rdquo; To achieve a high batting average, he must have swung and missed more times than others. Biographies of successful people often reveal that they\u0026rsquo;ve experienced more failures than those less successful. Failure is the mother of success, especially in investing.\nAspiring investors must withstand losses. Those who haven\u0026rsquo;t failed can\u0026rsquo;t achieve greatness; those who haven\u0026rsquo;t experienced losses can\u0026rsquo;t expect to make a fortune. Demanding a perfect track record leads to extreme conservatism and eliminates opportunities for success.\nThe biggest failure is to never fail. Avoiding mistakes eliminates chances for success. The best path to success is through failure and learning from it. Never forget your losses; they are the keys to victory. Successful investors analyze failures, learn from them, and improve their strategies.\nReflect and Restart\nMy failures have led to reflection, reassessment, and improved investment strategies. Most failures bring unexpected benefits. Treat failure as a necessary lesson, and your courage will grow.\nFailure can\u0026rsquo;t be learned secondhand. You won\u0026rsquo;t find books on \u0026ldquo;How to Lose 10 Million in Investments.\u0026rdquo; People brag about successes, not failures. Therefore, lessons from failure must come from personal experience.\nEveryone makes mistakes in investing. Even correct decisions can lead to losses. Since losses and failures are inevitable, accepting them and learning from them is crucial. Failure is not shameful or terrifying. Face it, overcome it, and success will follow.\n1. Take calculated risks for high rewards, be prepared for losses, and avoid undue self-blame.\n2. Learn from every failure, identify flawed decision-making habits, and avoid repeating them.\n3. Study valuable lessons from failures and discover opportunities for wealth creation.\n","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005972/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible - Investment Iron Law XIII","type":"posts"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law XII: Prosperity Comes From Land Ownership # Land possesses the characteristic of scarcity.\nWhy Real Estate Offers High Returns # Real estate prices have a long-term upward trend. Numerous research institutions in Taiwan have shown that the average annual return on real estate investment in Taiwan is around 22% to 25% or more, the highest among all investment tools. According to reports, real estate prices in Taipei\u0026rsquo;s Songshan and Xinyi districts have increased by as much as nine times in 10 years, translating to an average annual return of about 23%.\nThe Rise of Land Prices: There\u0026rsquo;s a Reason\nIn the long run, there are three main reasons why real estate prices rise and offer high returns:\nFirst, the supply of land is limited. Land is inherently scarce, and Taiwan, being an island, has limited land resources. With continuous development, the available land for construction is dwindling. Moreover, land cannot be imported, so the supply is decreasing rather than increasing, and this problem will become increasingly severe. Therefore, real estate prices are bound to increase year by year.\nSecond, demand continues to grow. Real estate can be generally divided into commercial and residential uses. Commercial real estate (such as shops and factories) can be considered a means of production. When a company\u0026rsquo;s profitability increases, it is willing to pay higher rent, which drives up the price of the property. As the company grows, its space requirements also increase annually.\nFor personal and family use, as the economy grows and incomes rise, the demand for living space and quality also increases. In the past, a family of seven, eight, or even more than ten people would be content to squeeze into a 70-100 square foot apartment. Now, with increased income, an average family of four needs a 130-165 square foot apartment or larger to be satisfied.\nA survey released in May 1996 showed that the homeownership rate in Taiwan was as high as 80%, but most were mixed-use properties with generally poor living quality, especially in metropolitan areas where the proportion of privately owned parking spaces was low. Despite the shrinking family size and high housing prices, the average living space per household has increased. In 1995, the average living space per household was 109 square feet, an increase of 20 square feet compared to 1990. As we move towards an information-based society, activities like working from home, online shopping, and banking from home will increase, further raising the demand for higher quality living spaces. Perhaps in 10 years, a 330 square foot apartment will no longer be sufficient.\nThird, inflation. Real estate not only satisfies the need for housing but also serves as a hedge against inflation. Inflation drives up the prices of tangible assets (like real estate) while devaluing intangible assets (like cash). The reason why real estate prices rise with inflation is simple: its costs, including land acquisition, building materials, and labor, are constantly increasing. These costs are inevitably reflected in the price of the property, and with sustained demand, real estate prices are bound to rise continuously.\nTherefore, the faster a country\u0026rsquo;s corporate profits increase (higher economic growth rate) and the faster national income rises, the faster real estate rents and prices will increase in the long run. Short-term real estate prices may not rise in tandem, but in the long term, prices will naturally reflect demand, and the average return on investment will be considerable.\nCan Real Estate Maintain High Returns in the Future?\nInvestors often question: \u0026ldquo;Real estate has indeed created many wealthy individuals in the past, but will it continue to rise in the future? The average annual return on real estate investment in the past was over 20%, mainly due to Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s rapid economic growth. Can Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s real estate maintain this high growth rate in the future?\u0026rdquo;\nTaiwan\u0026rsquo;s economy has transitioned from a period of rapid growth to a more stable growth phase. The average annual economic growth rate has decreased from around 9% over a decade ago to around 6% in recent years. Although economic growth has slowed significantly compared to the past, Taiwan still ranks among the top 10 globally in terms of economic growth. This is advantageous for real estate investment.\nMoreover, due to continuous population growth, Taiwan has a population density of 534 people per square kilometer, the second-highest in the world, making land even more valuable. The high savings rate among ordinary people and limited investment options mean that real estate and stocks are the primary investment channels for most. However, due to the volatility of stock prices, many prefer investing in real estate. The common belief is that leaving land or a house to the next generation provides a foundation for their future. Therefore, with limited supply and continuously increasing demand, real estate should still maintain a return rate of 15% to 20%. Furthermore, the government\u0026rsquo;s gradual relaxation of restrictions on foreign investment in Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s real estate market will further increase demand, leading to even better market performance.\nTaiwan has experienced multiple cycles of economic growth and recession, and real estate prices have gone through periods of rapid increases and long-term consolidation. Many investors questioned whether Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s housing prices would continue to rise. Especially during periods of domestic and cross-strait instability, many believed that Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s real estate market would collapse, leading them to sell their properties. Now, they regret their decisions. Facts have proven that as long as demand continues to grow and exceeds supply, prices will inevitably rise. This is an undeniable economic law. The cycle of \u0026ldquo;prices rise for a long time, then consolidate, then rise again\u0026rdquo; will continue to occur.\nIn conclusion, whether in the past, present, or future, real estate remains an indispensable investment tool for individuals, families, and businesses.\nThe three secrets to real estate investment:\nLocation, 2. Location, 3. Location. Lee Shau Kee\u0026rsquo;s Real Estate Investment Strategy # Hong Kong real estate tycoon Lee Shau Kee was ranked the richest Chinese in the world by Forbes magazine in 1996, with a net worth of US$12.7 billion, making him the fourth richest person globally. He ranked ahead of Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s richest man, Tsai Wan-lin, the fifth richest globally, and Li Ka-shing, the sixth richest and long-time wealthiest man in Hong Kong.\nLee Shau Kee is not well-known in Taiwan. Now 68 years old, he is the chairman of Henderson Land Development and Hong Kong and China Gas Company. His wealth primarily comes from Henderson Land, the second-largest listed company in Hong Kong in 1996, with a market capitalization of over NT$350 billion.\nAcquiring and Redeveloping Old Buildings at Low Prices\nAfter moving from Guangzhou to Hong Kong in 1948, Lee Shau Kee started in real estate sales, specializing in acquiring small plots of land, redeveloping them, and selling them using a then-novel sales method: \u0026ldquo;Stratified sales with ten-year installment payments.\u0026rdquo; This proved highly successful, making him famous. In 1976, he founded Henderson Land Development, focusing on real estate development, rebuilding old buildings, and developing small and medium-sized residential properties. By 1988, the company had expanded considerably, and Lee focused on real estate investment.\nLee Shau Kee\u0026rsquo;s unique skill lies in persuading owners of old buildings in bustling areas to sell their properties, acquiring them at low prices, demolishing them, and then rebuilding. Henderson Land\u0026rsquo;s vast land holdings also include farmland acquired from farmers in the early days and properties bought from overseas Chinese through advertisements in Chinese newspapers in the US and Canada.\nHe believes the best real estate investment strategy is to choose the right location, focusing on densely populated areas with convenient transportation. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s stratified sales or renting for personal use, such locations offer excellent returns on investment. He emphasizes that choosing an investment location requires the ability to turn one dollar into three.\nProsperity Comes From Land Ownership\nAfter years of research, the author has found that today\u0026rsquo;s wealthy individuals primarily accumulate their wealth through three avenues: inheritance, entrepreneurship, or investment. Among those who achieve wealth through investment, a vast majority do so through real estate.\nIndeed, most wealthy individuals have made their fortunes in real estate. In 1996, half of the world\u0026rsquo;s top ten richest individuals derived their wealth from land, including Hong Kong\u0026rsquo;s Lee Shau Kee, Li Ka-shing, Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s Tsai Wan-lin, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi of Japan\u0026rsquo;s Seibu Railway Group (ranked seventh globally), and Cheng Chou-ming (ranked tenth globally).\nAccording to the 1996 Forbes Rich List, 179 individuals involved in real estate controlled approximately US$257.2 billion in wealth, accounting for 64% of the total wealth on the list. This demonstrates that \u0026ldquo;prosperity comes from land ownership\u0026rdquo; is a timeless principle. This phenomenon is most pronounced in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan, where land is scarce and appreciation potential is high. Hong Kong\u0026rsquo;s top three richest individuals, Lee Shau Kee, Li Ka-shing, and Raymond Kwok of Sun Hung Kai Properties, all made their fortunes in real estate. Taiwan is no exception. Besides Tsai Wan-lin, prominent tycoons like Lin Rong-san, Lin Yu-lin, and Lin Hsieh-chen also built their empires on real estate. Most listed companies in Taiwan and Hong Kong are related to real estate. Even if their core business is not real estate, they have real estate investments. Companies like Yulon Motor, Shin Kong Life Insurance, Fubon Insurance, Chinatrust, and Yuanta Securities all derive significant income from real estate.\nTsai Wan-tsai, chairman of Fubon Group and one of Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s top ten richest individuals, primarily built his wealth through insurance, but stocks and real estate remain key investment tools. Tsai owns land in many bustling areas of Taipei, including a large plot near Nanyang Street, currently under development, and the newly opened Fubon Financial Center on Ren\u0026rsquo;ai Road, which he purchased in 1986 for over NT$1 billion. The 12,000 square foot property is now worth NT$4 billion. The 5,000 square foot Fubon Bank on Minsheng East Road, purchased in 1996 for NT$400,000 per ping (36 square feet), has now doubled in value. \u0026ldquo;Real estate makes money faster,\u0026rdquo; says Tsai Wan-tsai, who spends his free time looking for and buying land whenever he has the funds.\nThese examples demonstrate that for those seeking wealth through investment, real estate is an essential component of their portfolio, and should even be the primary focus. The success of financial management often depends on real estate ownership. Therefore, readers with sufficient funds should prioritize purchasing a home for personal use. Those with insufficient funds should consider leveraged investing to achieve homeownership and potentially higher returns. It\u0026rsquo;s worth reiterating: \u0026ldquo;Prosperity comes from land ownership.\u0026rdquo; Throughout history and across the globe, the vast majority of those who have achieved financial success have done so through real estate.\nFrom many perspectives, real estate is a better investment than stocks. While stocks can be a good investment, their prices fluctuate significantly. Listed stocks are traded centrally on exchanges with transparent pricing, leading to daily ups and downs that can be nerve-wracking for investors, especially when prices drop immediately after purchase. Holding stocks requires enduring the shock of substantial price swings, bringing joy during rises and pain during falls. Unfortunately, stock prices inevitably fluctuate.\nSome people experience pain regardless of whether prices rise or fall. During downturns, they regret their initial investment and don\u0026rsquo;t buy more at lower prices. During upturns, they regret not buying more initially. Their emotions are constantly affected by price movements. Real estate investment, on the other hand, doesn\u0026rsquo;t have these problems. Even if real estate prices fluctuate daily, it\u0026rsquo;s not readily apparent, allowing for a \u0026ldquo;buy and hold\u0026rdquo; strategy and enjoying the benefits of economic growth.\nLand near mountains or at the edge of development will inevitably appreciate in value.\nTsai Wan-lin\u0026rsquo;s Secret to Real Estate Riches # Tsai Wan-lin, Honorary Chairman of Cathay Life Insurance, is one of Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s richest individuals and among the top ten wealthiest globally, with a fortune of NT$180 billion. Despite his ordinary appearance and lack of exceptional academic credentials, how did Tsai Wan-lin build such a vast empire and create an extraordinary life? Where did his wealth come from? It\u0026rsquo;s widely known that he owns a \u0026ldquo;golden goose\u0026rdquo; company‚ÄîCathay Life Insurance‚Äîthe largest listed company in Taiwan by market capitalization. With over NT$500 billion in available funds for investment in real estate, securities, and loans, Cathay Life\u0026rsquo;s assets have grown rapidly, allowing Tsai Wan-lin\u0026rsquo;s wealth to snowball.\nBuy Land, Rent, Don\u0026rsquo;t Sell\nTsai Wan-lin\u0026rsquo;s secret to wealth lies in familiar investment tools: stocks and real estate. He keeps nearly 50% of the shares of his wealth-generating companies, Cathay Life Insurance and Cathay Real Estate Development, locked away, allowing them to appreciate naturally. Stocks have become his \u0026ldquo;real estate.\u0026rdquo; How did he turn actual real estate into a gold mine?\nTsai Wan-lin consistently invested his money in real estate and adopted a \u0026ldquo;buy-to-rent\u0026rdquo; strategy. Now in his 70s and semi-retired, he continues to look for and buy land, his lifelong passion. According to his third son, Tsai Chen-yu, Chairman of First Commercial Bank: \u0026ldquo;We mostly choose corner lots because they offer larger buildable areas and are lively. We moved to Ren\u0026rsquo;ai Road Section 4 in 1961. Back then, it was all shooting ranges and military factories, and there was no Fudan Bridge. Looking from Ximending, the East District was the edge of development.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In the past in Taiwan, land near mountains or at the edge of development would inevitably appreciate. Sure enough, in recent years, development has extended beyond the mountains to Xizhi and Nangang, so the suburban land we bought has now become prime real estate. Our land acquisition strategy has remained consistent over the years, and now our focus has shifted to Xizhi and Tucheng, buying large tracts of suburban land for gradual development.\u0026rdquo;\nElaborating on Tsai Wan-lin\u0026rsquo;s philosophy of leasing rather than selling real estate, he added: \u0026ldquo;Real estate is called \u0026lsquo;immovable property\u0026rsquo; because you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t move it. If you sell in the short term, you\u0026rsquo;ll only make a 10% or 20% profit. Hold it for the long term, and after decades, it becomes many times its original value. Therefore, the highest level of real estate investment is renting, not buying and selling.\u0026rdquo; Tsai Chen-yu, who studied in Japan, cites Japanese century-old businesses as examples. He observed that the success of Mitsubishi Estate and Mitsui Fudosan lies in owning real estate and holding onto it. More than 65% of their operating income comes from rental income.\nBecause Tsai Wan-lin acquired his land at very low costs, he then had Cathay Real Estate Development develop it and lease it to Cathay Life Insurance, creating a stable stream of rental income and land appreciation. Cathay Life Insurance invests billions of dollars in buying and selling real estate annually. Since they buy much more than they sell, they now own over 180 buildings throughout Taiwan. In short, Tsai Wan-lin\u0026rsquo;s secret to wealth lies in holding onto real estate for the long term.\nReal Estate and Stock Investment Strategies Are Similar\nThe strategies mentioned above for stock investment also apply to real estate investment. From an investment perspective, \u0026ldquo;buy anything, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; is also an excellent strategy for real estate.\n\u0026ldquo;Buy anything\u0026rdquo; emphasizes that selecting investment targets isn\u0026rsquo;t as difficult as it seems. It\u0026rsquo;s not necessary to have predictive abilities or advanced analytical skills. Diversification is key. The impact of individual investments isn\u0026rsquo;t that significant, so buying anything can work. However, because real estate investments are larger, diversification is harder to achieve. Also, purchasing real estate often involves multiple considerations, limiting the applicability of this \u0026ldquo;buy anything\u0026rdquo; approach.\n\u0026ldquo;Buy anytime\u0026rdquo; means investing in real estate whenever you have money, without waiting for the perfect timing, because you can never predict the market perfectly. For most people, \u0026ldquo;buy anytime\u0026rdquo; seems unrealistic given the high cost of real estate. Being able to buy one house in a lifetime is already considered a significant achievement. Real estate isn\u0026rsquo;t like stocks, which can be bought in smaller amounts anytime. However, don\u0026rsquo;t underestimate yourself. Invest small amounts in stocks regularly, and when you\u0026rsquo;ve saved enough, consider leveraged investment. By following the investment principles in this book, buying three or four houses in a lifetime is achievable.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; is difficult to achieve with stocks, but easier with real estate because price fluctuations are less visible and less likely to influence decisions. Many \u0026ldquo;land rich\u0026rdquo; individuals became wealthy by adhering to this principle. Real estate is also known as \u0026ldquo;immovable property.\u0026rdquo; If you can adopt a mindset of \u0026ldquo;own the property, ignore the price,\u0026rdquo; buying and holding long-term will naturally yield high returns. Moreover, transaction costs for real estate are higher than for stocks, including taxes like land value increment tax, capital gains tax, and deed tax. If you use an agent, you\u0026rsquo;ll incur additional fees, making the overall transaction costs quite high.\nFor real estate investment, value investing, growth investing, and contrarian investing are even better strategies than \u0026ldquo;buy anything, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell.\u0026rdquo; Value investing involves buying when the intrinsic value of the property exceeds its price. As mentioned earlier, value is difficult to measure precisely for real estate, relying on subjective judgment, though market trends can provide guidance. For instance, if real estate prices decline significantly, the intrinsic value likely exceeds the market price, creating a good buying opportunity.\nChoosing the Right Location is Crucial\nContrarian investing in real estate means selecting locations that others are currently overlooking but have future growth potential. If these areas develop as anticipated, the initial low purchase price will generate substantial profits. Avoid buying when everyone else is rushing into the market, as prices are likely inflated. Conversely, when everyone believes prices will continue to fall and market activity is low, it might be the best time to invest.\nGrowth investing is perhaps the most important and easiest of the three strategies for real estate. The three secrets to real estate investment are location, location, location. The key is to consider the future growth potential of the location. Don\u0026rsquo;t choose the cheapest or currently best areas, but those with future development prospects.\nHow do you choose a good location? It requires some imagination. Real estate development is like a ripple effect from a stone thrown into a calm lake. Initially, development centers around the city center, but the surrounding areas become the fastest-growing and most promising investment targets. Growth investors can sell their properties in the city center at high prices and reinvest in cheaper outlying areas to enjoy significant future appreciation. In Taipei, the best investment location 20 years ago was Ximending. Now it\u0026rsquo;s the Eastern District, and future development will likely focus on suburban areas like Xizhi and Tucheng. Those looking to buy real estate should explore the outskirts, envisioning future development directions.\nBuy Now, Hold Long-Term: The Best Strategy\nReal estate is a cyclical industry with predictable price patterns. Short-term price fluctuations are inevitable, but in the long run, prices tend to rise. The characteristic pattern is a long period of rising prices followed by consolidation, then another period of rising prices. Real estate also exhibits a common market characteristic: the faster prices rise, the faster demand increases.\nHistorically, Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s real estate market cycles have lasted between three and nine years, averaging seven years. One characteristic of rising prices is a substantial increase of two to four times at the beginning of each cycle, followed by years of consolidation. Some hope to buy at the very beginning of a price increase, but no one can accurately predict the exact starting point. By the time you realize prices are rising, they\u0026rsquo;ve already increased substantially, and by the time you place an order, the price might be double or even more. Since no one can predict the start of a price increase, the smartest and best approach is to act promptly, buy property, and hold it long-term for substantial profits.\nGenerally, there are several signs of an impending price increase: rising stock prices, favorable government policies, and the central bank lowering interest rates to loosen monetary policy. Stock prices are a good predictor of economic activity. Rising stock prices increase available funds, which often fuels real estate price increases.\nReal estate is a \u0026ldquo;locomotive\u0026rdquo; industry. To stimulate an economy, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to stimulate real estate prices. When the government injects capital into the market and lowers interest rates to boost the economy, it often presents an excellent opportunity to invest in both real estate and stocks.\nThe two secrets to land investment are \u0026ldquo;wait\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;endure.\u0026rdquo; The right time to develop can often take two decades.\nCheng Chou-ming\u0026rsquo;s Real Estate Investment Strategy # Cheng Chou-ming, the richest man in the Philippines, has seen his wealth surge due to the recent boom in the Philippine real estate market. In 1996, Forbes estimated his net worth at US$7 billion, placing him among the world\u0026rsquo;s top ten richest individuals. His secret to success lies in stocks and real estate, and his investment strategy involves contrarian investing: buying the best assets at the lowest prices during times of low market confidence and holding them long-term.\nCheng Chou-ming owns land in Taiwan, the Philippines, mainland China, and Houston, Texas. His holdings include 32 plots of land in Taiwan totaling 135 acres and 362 plots in the Philippines exceeding 50,000 acres, where he is currently building skyscrapers. He also has a large-scale project on Fuga Island in the northern Philippines, a 250,000-acre island larger than Hong Kong by one-third, where he plans to build a free port with docks, an airport, and hotels.\nPatience and Endurance Yield Hundredfold Returns\nCheng Chou-ming, a keen real estate investor, bought large tracts of land in the Philippines 20 years ago for NT$0.2 per ping, which has now appreciated to over NT$600. This is his philosophy of \u0026ldquo;endurance,\u0026rdquo; patiently waiting 20 years for a two- to three-thousandfold return. Cheng Chou-ming says: \u0026ldquo;There are four types of people in real estate development: land investors, land developers, constructors, and builders.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Land investment takes longer, so land investors generally make larger profits, while the latter three, with shorter investment horizons, earn smaller margins, often just making money from developing the land. Land investment requires initial capital and a keen eye for location selection. Entering the market at the right time allows you to acquire land cheaply.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Future purchases of new land and interest payments on existing land can be covered by selling a small portion of the existing holdings. For example, selling one plot of land for the Asiaworld Group currently covers the acquisition cost of all our land. So, with patience and endurance, future returns can be hundreds or even thousands of times the initial investment.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the early 1970s, Cheng Chou-ming acquired the current site of the Grand Hyatt Taipei on Nanjing East Road for a very low price. While others were selling their properties and preparing to emigrate, Cheng Chou-ming decisively purchased this overgrown and neglected land, which became his base for future development in Taiwan.\nCheng Chou-ming excels at recognizing that the worst of times offer the best opportunities. During the cross-strait crisis, which caused a plunge in real estate and stock prices, he quietly acquired large amounts of stock. He said: \u0026ldquo;At that time, many stock prices were very low, and some offered annual dividends of over 20%, higher than bank interest rates. Such stocks are rare globally. With long-term investment, even just collecting dividends is worthwhile. As long as you choose the right stocks and invest long-term, you\u0026rsquo;re bound to make a lot of money.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Importance of Brand in Real Estate Investment\nMost people\u0026rsquo;s first real estate investment is a home for personal use, often buying pre-sale properties. There are three secrets to investing in a home: location, location, location.\nChoosing a home should prioritize the environment. The story of Mencius\u0026rsquo;s mother moving three times highlights the importance of the surrounding environment, safety, and the quality of neighbors, all of which impact quality of life and children\u0026rsquo;s development. Transportation, amenities, and other factors should also be considered. When purchasing pre-sale properties, focus on the \u0026ldquo;brand.\u0026rdquo; Such investments carry high risks, so the developer\u0026rsquo;s reputation and financial health are paramount, followed by practicality and growth potential.\nIn the past, when average incomes were lower, people bought cars that simply ran, were affordable, and looked decent. As demand increased and economic conditions improved, attention shifted to details, and brand and quality became more important. Cars require maintenance and repairs. Choosing a random repair shop can be problematic, with mechanics unfamiliar with the car model and a lack of available parts. Therefore, buyers began to consider the after-sales service offered by the car manufacturer.\nSimilarly, people used to buy homes that were simply livable, affordable, and in a reasonably acceptable environment. With economic growth and rising incomes, people are more demanding of quality of life, and the concept of \u0026ldquo;brand\u0026rdquo; has become increasingly important in real estate. According to the Consumers\u0026rsquo; Foundation in Taiwan, real estate litigation cases are rampant, and most cases end without resolution.\nMany construction companies in Taiwan are \u0026ldquo;one-project companies,\u0026rdquo; dissolving after completing a single project. Therefore, after purchasing a property, if any issues arise (such as unclear property rights, substandard building materials, or discrepancies in area), buyers often have no recourse. Furthermore, problems with the internal structure of a house may not be apparent initially, surfacing only after some time, such as water leaks, wall cracks, or plumbing issues. By then, there might be no one to hold accountable, highlighting the importance of brand reputation.\nReal estate investment is a major life decision. For a home, comfort is essential. Even if the purchase is for investment purposes, a \u0026ldquo;quality-guaranteed\u0026rdquo; property will be easier to sell and fetch a better price.\nAfter-sales service is another crucial factor in real estate investment. Many construction companies disengage after handing over the property, leaving the management committee to the homeowners. Due to a lack of authority and resources, these committees often struggle to address issues, leading to dissatisfaction among residents.\nSeveral reputable construction companies in Taiwan are now emphasizing community management and after-sales service. For instance, Taichung\u0026rsquo;s Sancai Construction, the company where the author currently works, entrusts community management to an affiliated company, integrating software and hardware services to create a safe and comfortable living environment. Sancai Construction also provides security, repairs, bill payment services, and housekeeping services.\nTherefore, future real estate investors should consider not only location and environment but also the developer\u0026rsquo;s brand, quality, and after-sales service. Choosing a reputable company with quality assurance, good after-sales service, and effective management is crucial for successful real estate investment.\nAs long as you avoid buying during periods of rapidly rising prices, the risk of leveraged investment is relatively low.\nLeveraged Investment in Real Estate # The substantial investment required for real estate often deters potential investors. The fact that property prices often rise faster than wages further contributes to the increasing wealth gap. However, real estate investment is relatively low-risk as long as you avoid the frenzy of buying during periods of soaring prices. Real estate, being a tangible asset, is easy to mortgage. Coupled with its high long-term returns and less visible price volatility, it\u0026rsquo;s an ideal candidate for leveraged investment.\nThe Benefit of Spreading Out Payments\nHome mortgages typically span 20 years, effectively spreading out the total cost of the property plus interest over two decades. For instance, purchasing a NT$5 million house with a 70% mortgage at a 9% interest rate over 20 years results in a monthly payment of NT$31,490.\nTherefore, if you have NT$1.5 million in savings and can afford the monthly payments, you should consider buying a property. The government often provides preferential interest rates for first-time homebuyers to promote homeownership. Those without a house should take advantage of these programs.\nSome argue that renting is more cost-effective than buying in Taiwan. A NT$5 million house might rent for only NT$20,000 per month, while buying requires a NT$1.5 million down payment and monthly mortgage payments exceeding NT$30,000. This argument usually arises during market downturns or periods of stagnation. However, it\u0026rsquo;s flawed because it ignores the long-term upward trend of real estate prices. Renting would indeed be better if prices remained constant, but they don\u0026rsquo;t. Given long-term price appreciation, buying is more cost-effective than renting, especially because leveraging magnifies returns, making real estate a high-yield investment. Many have become wealthy through real estate ownership. In short, if you can afford to buy, it\u0026rsquo;s better than renting, offering greater security and an excellent investment opportunity.\nMortgage Pressure is Manageable\nSome are reluctant to take on a mortgage due to the perceived burden of monthly payments. Twenty years ago, NT$1 million could buy a 50+ ping luxury apartment in Taipei. A 70% mortgage at a 9% interest rate translated to monthly payments of over NT$4,000. Back then, a university graduate\u0026rsquo;s starting salary was around NT$8,000 to NT$10,000, making NT$4,000 a significant burden. However, 20 years later, with inflation, experience, and increased earning power, the average monthly salary should be above NT$50,000, making the same mortgage payment much less burdensome.\nTherefore, young people investing in real estate with leverage shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be overly concerned about the initial mortgage pressure. While NT$30,000+ per month might seem daunting, future income growth will gradually ease the burden within five to ten years.\nA manager at an American bank said: \u0026ldquo;The biggest problem with mortgages in the US is people defaulting on their loans. In Taiwan, the biggest problem is people paying off their mortgages early.\u0026rdquo;\nModerate mortgage pressure can be beneficial for financial management, promoting forced savings and reduced spending. As mentioned earlier, starting early with diligent saving and investing in high-yield assets like stocks and real estate lays a solid foundation for future financial success.\nTherefore, young people with sufficient down payment and the ability to manage monthly payments should consider leveraged investment in a home. As long as borrowing is within reasonable limits, avoiding foreclosure, long-term leveraged investment in real estate is undoubtedly advantageous.\n","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005971/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law XII","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/real-estate-investment/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Real Estate Investment","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/real-estate-wealth/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Real Estate Wealth","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/success/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Success","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E4%B8%BE%E5%80%BA%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"‰∏æÂÄ∫ÊäïËµÑ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%9C%B0%E6%AE%B5%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Âú∞ÊÆµÈÄâÊã©","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%A4%B1%E8%B4%A5/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Â§±Ë¥•","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%88%BF%E5%9C%B0%E4%BA%A7%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÊàøÂú∞‰∫ßÊäïËµÑ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%88%BF%E5%9C%B0%E4%BA%A7%E8%87%B4%E5%AF%8C/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÊàøÂú∞‰∫ßËá¥ÂØå","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E7%BB%8F%E9%AA%8C/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÁªèÈ™å","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E8%A1%8C%E5%8A%A8%E5%8A%9B/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Ë°åÂä®Âäõ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E8%B4%A2%E5%8A%A1%E6%9D%A0%E6%9D%86/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Ë¥¢Âä°Êù†ÊùÜ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E9%80%9A%E8%B4%A7%E8%86%A8%E8%83%80/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÈÄöË¥ßËÜ®ËÉÄ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E9%95%BF%E6%9C%9F%E6%8C%81%E6%9C%89/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÈïøÊúüÊåÅÊúâ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"13 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/contrarian-investing/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Contrarian Investing","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"13 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/growth-investing/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Growth Investing","type":"tags"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law X: Mastering the Tools of Stock Market Offense and Defense # Buy when Value is higher than Price. Sell when Value is lower than Price.\nValue Investing # The strategy of \u0026ldquo;buy any stock, buy at any time, and don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; sounds simple, but most people can\u0026rsquo;t follow it. Even if they acknowledge its potential for wealth creation, they lack the courage to implement it because it seems to contradict common investment beliefs and principles. Therefore, the author presents three superior investment strategies: value investing, growth investing, and contrarian investing. Before investing, using these strategies, you must ask yourself: Does the investment target hold this value? What is its future growth potential? Is everyone investing in it? These three investment strategies can help you make better decisions.\nVerifying Value Ensures Profitability\nDuring the 1920s, Florida\u0026rsquo;s real estate prices skyrocketed daily, triggering a buying frenzy. One fortunate investor managed to secure a plot of land. Most buyers didn\u0026rsquo;t care about the land\u0026rsquo;s quality, but this investor prudently asked a real estate agent to show him the purchased land. He was shocked to discover it was swampland. \u0026ldquo;Can anyone live here?\u0026rdquo; he exclaimed. The agent calmly replied, \u0026ldquo;Why worry about that? As long as the price goes up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Human behavior and decision-making are perfectly rational\u0026rdquo; is a fundamental assumption in academic research and theoretical development. Generally, consumers won\u0026rsquo;t rush to buy unless a product offers exceptional value. For instance, no one would pay $5 million for a car worth $500,000 unless they were foolish. Investment decisions, involving money and future wealth, are even more critical than buying a car. Logically, people should be more rational and cautious, making decisions only after careful calculations.\nHowever, are investors truly rational? In July 1985, China Development Corporation\u0026rsquo;s stock price was NT$14 per share. Four years later, in September 1989, it reached NT$1075, a nearly 80-fold increase. Remarkably, in 1985, when the price was low, investors shunned the stock, resulting in low trading volume. Conversely, in 1989, when the price soared to over NT$1000, investors rushed in, fearing they would miss out, driving trading volume to its peak.\nAre these investment behaviors rational? Consider the difference between China Development Corporation at NT$14 in 1985, at over NT$1000 in 1989, or even at NT$50 in 1983. Essentially, the difference was minimal; it was the same company, managed by practically the same people, with similar assets. Why such a drastic price difference? The answer lies not in the company\u0026rsquo;s intrinsic changes but in investors\u0026rsquo; behavioral and decision-making biases.\nBetween 1989 and 1990, during the Taiwan stock market\u0026rsquo;s peak, investors continued pouring in. The author often asked friends and family, \u0026ldquo;Do you think the stocks you\u0026rsquo;re buying are worth the price?\u0026rdquo; Most found the question perplexing and avoided answering. Some reluctantly admitted, \u0026ldquo;Probably not.\u0026rdquo; The author would then ask, \u0026ldquo;Why buy them then?\u0026rdquo; Their confident reply: \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;ll go up!\u0026rdquo;\nSome also questioned the author\u0026rsquo;s lack of participation in this lucrative market. The response: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll wait until after 4000 points to invest.\u0026rdquo; The author believed the Taiwan stock market\u0026rsquo;s true value was below 4000 points (in 1989). Those who heard this scoffed, \u0026ldquo;Keep waiting.\u0026rdquo; As it turned out, overvalued assets cannot rise indefinitely. In August 1990, the Taiwan stock index plummeted to around 2000 points, proving the author\u0026rsquo;s point. No investment\u0026rsquo;s price can remain perpetually above or below its true value.\nBuy When Value Exceeds Price\nValue investing, introduced by Benjamin Graham in his 1933 book Security Analysis, was later championed by his students, including Warren Buffett and John Templeton. In the 1980s, value investing gained prominence in the US, becoming the strategy of choice for many successful long-term investors.\nValue investing posits that every stock has an intrinsic value. Price fluctuations arise from investor trading. Prices exceeding intrinsic value will eventually revert, and prices falling below will eventually recover.\nThe principle is simple: buy when the value is higher than the price, regardless of market fluctuations. If it\u0026rsquo;s cheap, buy it. Conversely, sell when the value is lower than the price. In short, buy low, sell high. Sell when prices significantly exceed value amidst widespread buying, minimizing holdings. Buy when prices fall drastically below value amidst widespread fear, increasing holdings.\nTypically, investors focus solely on price appreciation, neglecting value. People meticulously research cars, refrigerators, or stereos for months, comparing models, reading reviews, and seeking advice, constantly evaluating value for money. They\u0026rsquo;ll wait for a sale if the price is too high. Yet, when buying stocks, often on a whim based on a tip or hearsay, they overlook value, making hasty decisions involving sums far exceeding appliance purchases.\nInvest with an Owner\u0026rsquo;s Mindset\nWarren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy emphasizes investing with an owner\u0026rsquo;s mindset and a long-term perspective. This involves buying stocks of companies with stable earnings growth, positive prospects, high asset value, or simply when the intrinsic value exceeds the price.\nCrowds flock to department stores during sales and clearances. The steeper the discounts, the larger the crowds. Conversely, shopping is most pleasant when there are no sales, as stores are less crowded. This is because consumers are motivated by value, buying when prices are below perceived worth.\nHowever, in stock markets, the opposite occurs. Brokerage houses are deserted when stock prices are at their lowest. Conversely, they are packed when prices are soaring. Investors are motivated by rising prices. A stock falling from $100 to $50 attracts little interest, while rapid price increases fuel buying frenzy.\nThe assumption of rational economic behavior applies well to consumer choices but not to investment behavior. As illustrated, investment decisions are often driven by irrational emotions, impulses, and intuition.\nValue investing advises emulating consumer behavior: buy when stocks are \u0026ldquo;on sale,\u0026rdquo; and avoid the herd when prices are inflated.\nDeveloping the Ability to Calculate Asset and Earnings Value\nThe key to successful value investing is the ability to calculate a company\u0026rsquo;s intrinsic value, encompassing asset value and earnings value. Asset value represents the liquidation value of the company\u0026rsquo;s assets per share. Earnings value represents the present value of the company\u0026rsquo;s projected future earnings. Estimating future earnings is challenging, requiring the development of forecasting skills.\nCalculating intrinsic value is not easy. Investing in familiar companies simplifies this process. Taiwanese businesswoman Shirley Wang, CEO of FIC Global, primarily invested in FIC and related IT and semiconductor companies. Her familiarity with the industry allowed her to better grasp its dynamics.\nMany successful investors adhere to Buffett\u0026rsquo;s philosophy, investing only in familiar companies. Li-Ching Hsu, former Taiwan head of ING Group, frequently advised investors to focus on companies in their own industry or related sectors.\nInvestment decisions should always involve value analysis. Buy when the value is present or the price is attractive; sell otherwise. Value investing encourages adopting consumer-like behavior in the stock market, buying low and selling high.\n1. When investing in stocks, ask \u0026ldquo;Is it worth buying?\u0026rdquo; not just \u0026ldquo;Will it go up?\u0026rdquo;\n2. Learn from consumer behavior: buy when prices are discounted.\nChoose a great company, and if it keeps growing, you\u0026rsquo;ll almost never have to sell.\nGrowth Investing # Valuing a company is challenging. Some professional investors therefore focus on earnings growth rate, a primary driver of value, as their investment criterion. Growth investing has been successfully employed by renowned investors, notably Peter Lynch, former manager of Fidelity\u0026rsquo;s Magellan Fund, who achieved the highest 15-year return among hundreds of US mutual funds.\nInvesting in High-Growth Potential Stocks\nSimply put, growth investing involves buying stocks of companies with high future growth potential and selling when that potential diminishes. A key characteristic is maintaining full investment, ideally diversified. Growth investors acknowledge their inability to predict short-term market movements but believe in the long-term upward trend of stocks, especially those with high growth potential.\nThey invest all their capital in high-growth stocks. Peter Lynch maintained a nearly 100% invested portfolio during his tenure at Magellan Fund, keeping minimal cash reserves for redemptions.\nThe key to successful growth investing lies in identifying companies with high growth potential. This is the challenge: finding high-growth stocks. Investing in IBM 30 years ago, Microsoft 15 years ago, or Cathay Life Insurance in Taiwan would have yielded multifold returns.\nHowever, countless seemingly high-growth companies fizzle out. No one can predict the future with certainty. Even Peter Lynch admitted that only half of his stock picks were truly successful, but that was enough. Therefore, diversification is crucial for mitigating the higher risks of growth investing.\nGrowth investing believes that a company\u0026rsquo;s real growth drives stock price appreciation. Investment returns depend on the earnings over the next few years. For high returns, choose investments with 5-10 year growth potential. Invest in companies in high-growth industries with excellent performance and a sustainable growth outlook. Their stock prices are likely to rise with the company\u0026rsquo;s growth, offering substantial long-term gains.\nChoosing the Right Industry is More Important Than Choosing the Right Company\nGrowth investors prioritize future earnings growth potential. Industry growth is crucial for a company\u0026rsquo;s earnings. Choosing the right industry is therefore more important than choosing the right company. Consider the future 5-10 year demand for the company\u0026rsquo;s products, focusing on the industry\u0026rsquo;s growth potential. Peter Lynch advised against selling good stocks prematurely for small profits and recommended selling stocks of companies with deteriorating growth prospects, even at a loss. This approach allows gains from successful picks to offset losses from unsuccessful ones, resulting in overall profit.\nPeter Lynch advocated for a \u0026ldquo;common sense\u0026rdquo; approach to investing, illustrated in his book One Up On Wall Street. He profited from observing his wife\u0026rsquo;s preference for certain hosiery and dish soap brands, and his children\u0026rsquo;s preference for certain sneakers, leading him to invest in those companies. This approach can be explained by market efficiency theory. Retailers and observant consumers are often the first to notice a product\u0026rsquo;s popularity, before analysts. By adopting a consumer perspective and noticing trends overlooked by experts, investors can gain an edge.\nIn early 1996, after a frugal, retired court clerk passed away, her family discovered her substantial wealth. She had consistently invested small amounts in Coca-Cola stock for decades, capitalizing on its growth and share price appreciation. This illustrates the power of long-term investment in growing companies.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Just Focus on Price Fluctuations\nMany investors are unclear about their investment rationale. If you can\u0026rsquo;t explain your investment\u0026rsquo;s business and growth potential in five minutes, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t own it. Focus on monitoring the validity of your investment thesis, not daily price fluctuations.\nMany investors prefer startups or pre-IPO companies. However, established, profitable companies with growth potential are often better investments. Peter Lynch suggested capturing the middle five years of a company\u0026rsquo;s 15-year growth trajectory, rather than the initial or mature phases. If a stock has the potential to rise from $2 to $200, wait until it reaches $8 before buying. The potential gains are still substantial, and the risk is lower. Losing money in the stock market is quick, but making money takes time. Most stocks take 3-5 years to rise significantly.\nRegarding industry growth potential, in Taiwan, IT, communications, and semiconductors within the electronics industry are promising. Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology are also attractive due to increasing health consciousness. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s ten emerging industries (specialty chemicals, environmental protection, aerospace, telecommunications, semiconductors, IT, pharmaceuticals, precision machinery, etc.) offer future growth opportunities. In the service sector, securities and investment trust, construction, and shipping also have good prospects. Savvy investors should anticipate future trends, popular products, internet-driven products, and leverage their own consumer insights to identify investment opportunities.\nGrowth investing is suitable for non-professional investors. It requires no specialized training or constant monitoring. To identify growth stocks, consider a company\u0026rsquo;s potential performance over the next 5-10 years. Invest in companies with strong growth potential and hold them long-term, selling only when they transition from growth to maturity. This strategy allows even amateur investors with limited time and expertise to achieve good results.\n1. Real earnings growth drives stock price appreciation.\n2. Diversify investments in companies with sustainable 5-10 year growth potential, patiently awaiting substantial returns.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t follow the crowd; be rational. Figure out what most people are doing, then don\u0026rsquo;t do it.\nContrarian Investing # Many ask, \u0026ldquo;Is there a better time to buy than \u0026lsquo;any time\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo; Research suggests there is: contrarian investing, a time-tested and remarkably effective strategy.\nBuy Straw Hats in Winter, Boats in a Drought\nA 19th-century American tycoon, when asked about his wealth-building secret, replied, \u0026ldquo;Buy straw hats in winter.\u0026rdquo; Similarly, Fan Li, a wealthy merchant in ancient China, followed the principle of \u0026ldquo;buying fur coats in summer, selling in winter; buying boats in a drought, selling when it rains.\u0026rdquo; These are examples of contrarian investing.\nThis investment concept originated in ancient China. According to Records of the Grand Historian, Ji Ran, an economist during the Warring States period, proposed the contrarian strategy of \u0026ldquo;invest in boats during drought, invest in carts during floods.\u0026rdquo; He argued that during droughts, when everyone invests in cart production, one should invest in boats. The oversupply of carts would lower prices and profits. When the rains return, boat demand would surge, raising prices and profits. Conversely, during floods, when everyone invests in boats, one should invest in carts.\nContrarian investing means investing when most people aren\u0026rsquo;t and selling when everyone is eager to buy. The concept is simple: go against the crowd. However, implementing it is challenging. It requires overcoming human nature, resisting herd mentality, cultivating independent judgment, and enduring loneliness. Most investors follow the crowd, while contrarian investors look for opportunities when others are fearful. This strategy relies on the belief that widespread consensus is often wrong and that reversals can be powerful.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Be Deceived by Net Buying or Selling\nContrarian investing works because when most people are bullish, available capital is already invested, leading to overinflated prices. With everyone already in the market, poised to sell, potential supply outweighs demand. Any negative news can trigger a sharp decline.\nConversely, when most people are bearish, selling pressure is minimal as most have already sold. With potential buyers waiting on the sidelines, demand outweighs supply. Any positive news can trigger a sharp rise.\nInvestors tend to extrapolate past trends, especially when reinforced by market sentiment. During initial market declines, most see it as temporary, while a few predict further declines. As the market continues falling, bears are rewarded, and bulls suffer. At severely oversold levels, widespread pessimism creates buying opportunities. Conversely, during initial market rallies, most see it as temporary, while a few predict further gains. As the market continues rising, bulls are rewarded, and bears suffer. At severely overbought levels, widespread optimism leads to overvaluation.\nBullish When Rising, Bearish When Falling\nPeople tend to become more optimistic during optimistic periods and more pessimistic during pessimistic periods. They rely on memory to predict the future. A rising market breeds bullishness, and a falling market breeds bearishness.\nAt the peak of the Taiwan stock market in late 1989, the author taught an investment course. During one lecture, a student requested the author refrain from discussing stocks. Surprised, the author asked why. The student explained that every class, from political science to calculus, included discussions about stocks.\nAnother anecdote from that period involves a professor asking his class the time. A student instinctively replied, \u0026ldquo;9865 points, up 65 points.\u0026rdquo; Students were constantly monitoring stock prices during lectures. This illustrates the pervasive stock market mania at the time. As it turned out, this widespread obsession was a harbinger of the impending crash.\nGreat investments often involve defying conventional wisdom, selling when others are buying, and buying when others are selling. Be bearish before others when everyone is bullish, and be bullish before others when everyone is bearish. As a Wall Street adage goes, \u0026ldquo;Markets are born in despair, grow in skepticism, mature in optimism, and die in euphoria.\u0026rdquo;\nContrarian investing doesn\u0026rsquo;t require constantly opposing the majority. It encourages resisting herd mentality and cultivating independent thinking. The best buying opportunities may arise when most are afraid to buy, but buying solely for that reason is as foolish as following the crowd. The crowd isn\u0026rsquo;t always wrong. Develop independent judgment. True contrarians don\u0026rsquo;t blindly oppose the majority but wait for the dust to settle and buy when no one is paying attention.\nContrarian investing applies to stock selection. David Dreman, in his book Contrarian Investment Strategies, argued that unpopular companies often outperform expectations, while popular companies are susceptible to minor setbacks.\nTiming the market is difficult. Mastering the principles of contrarian investing can be highly rewarding.\n1. Invest when others aren\u0026rsquo;t; sell when everyone is eager to invest.\n2. Don\u0026rsquo;t follow the crowd; buy when investor sentiment has cooled and no one is paying attention.\nValue, Growth, and Contrarian Strategies are Best Suited for Experts\nThese seemingly disparate strategies are not mutually exclusive. Investors can choose or combine strategies based on their individual characteristics. The most effective strategy is subjective and depends on individual circumstances. The author recommends value investing for those skilled in financial analysis, growth investing for those with foresight, and contrarian investing for independent, emotionally disciplined individuals.\nValue investing is considered the most sophisticated technique, requiring strong financial knowledge and valuation skills. Most investors lack this expertise. Even among analysts, few truly understand valuation. Growth investing requires foresight to identify high-growth industries and companies, which is also challenging. Contrarian investing requires no specialized knowledge but is the hardest to implement due to its counterintuitive nature. Most people are trend followers. Few can buy when everyone is selling or sell when everyone is buying.\nThese three strategies can enhance returns if mastered and applied correctly. Countless self-proclaimed \u0026ldquo;investment experts\u0026rdquo; populate the market, but few consistently outperform using these strategies. Misapplied, these strategies can lead to short-term speculation and losses. Therefore, the author still recommends the simple, yet effective, long-term buy-and-hold strategy of \u0026ldquo;buy any stock, buy at any time, and don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; for most investors.\n","date":"13 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005969/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law X","type":"posts"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law XI: Avoid Short-Term Trading # The greatest enemy of investment activity is human weakness: greed, fear, and herd mentality.\nThe Pitfalls of Buying Low and Selling High # Stock prices fluctuate in the short term, leading many investors to intuitively believe that profits can be made by simply \u0026ldquo;buying low and selling high.\u0026rdquo; Undeniably, the allure of price differences is strong. A limit-up day can bring thousands of dollars in profit, and buying ten lots could cover a month\u0026rsquo;s salary. However, once captivated by this temptation and engaging in the game of short-term trading, you unknowingly enter a losing battle. While luck might bring short-term gains, long-term losses are inevitable.\nStock Profits Are More Than Just Price Differences\nMany stock investors hold the misconception that profits come solely from price fluctuations. In reality, the primary source of profit lies in sharing the company\u0026rsquo;s earnings, not capitalizing on short-term price swings. Stock investments generate returns because the invested companies\u0026rsquo; earnings are ultimately distributed to investors. The immense time and effort spent researching entry and exit points, diligently watching the market, and constantly chasing trends contribute nothing to the company\u0026rsquo;s earnings.\nThe Taiwan Weighted Stock Index rose from 100 points in early 1967 to 6200 points at the end of August 1996, a 62-fold increase. Using the end of 1986 as a base period, when the index was around 700 points, the rise to 6200 points by the end of August 1996 represents an increase of over 8 times. The Taiwan stock market\u0026rsquo;s astonishing growth and substantial returns should have made every investor wealthy. However, the reality is quite the opposite. Few Taiwanese investors have profited from stocks, while countless have suffered losses. According to a 1988 survey by Professor Lin Quanyuan, 27% of investors experienced losses, and 78% earned returns below the market average. Private surveys suggest even higher loss rates. The question arises: \u0026ldquo;Where did the substantial stock market profits go?\u0026rdquo;\nShort-Term Trading is Gambling\nShort-term stock trading is speculation and gambling, both characterized by a high probability of loss. We often see short-term traders boastful after successful speculations but disappear or remain silent after losses. This creates the false impression that short-term trading is profitable. In truth, these traders usually end up losing money.\nLong-term stock holding yields an average annual return of over 15%, but only if the stocks are held and not sold. The biggest problem with short-term trading is the transaction costs incurred with each trade. Investors often overlook these costs, believing they are insignificant compared to potential price differences. In the Taiwanese securities market, the transaction cost for each round trip (buy and sell) is approximately 0.6% of the transaction amount. While a single transaction cost seems small, the cumulative effect is substantial. Imagine trading more than 25 times a year, or every two weeks. The 15% annual return would be almost entirely eroded, making it worse than keeping the money in a bank. Moreover, short-term traders often exceed 25 trades per year. Factor in a few losses, and the return becomes negative. Frequent trading inevitably diminishes returns, and negative returns are no different from gambling.\nTherefore, if you cannot resist the urge to chase short-term price differences, it\u0026rsquo;s best to avoid stock investment altogether and keep your money in the bank. While you may not become rich, it\u0026rsquo;s better than losing it all in the stock market.\nIn 1989, the total after-tax earnings of all listed companies in Taiwan were 110.3 billion NTD. In the same year, securities transaction taxes were 152.4 billion NTD, and transaction fees totaled 76.2 billion NTD. This means the combined earnings of listed companies were insufficient to cover these costs, leaving investors with an additional 118.3 billion NTD in transaction costs. It\u0026rsquo;s no wonder most stock investors suffer losses. The solution is simple: adopt a long-term holding strategy and minimize unnecessary trading. Long-term stock market investment offers high returns and lower risk. By holding long term, there\u0026rsquo;s no need for worry or fear, and wealth can be accumulated over one or two decades.\nShort-Term Trading Creates Wealth for Intermediaries\nTo achieve investment success, one must overcome \u0026ldquo;greed during market upswings and fear during downswings.\u0026rdquo;\nA book from the 1940s in the US, titled Where Are the Customer\u0026rsquo;s Yachts?, tells the story of a stockbroker taking a major client to a marina. Pointing at the luxurious yachts, the broker says, \u0026ldquo;These yachts belong to our firm\u0026rsquo;s brokers.\u0026rdquo; The client then asks, \u0026ldquo;Are any of them owned by your clients?\u0026rdquo; The broker is speechless, as none of the yachts belonged to clients. (Note: yachts were a status symbol of wealth in American society at that time).\nIt seems unlikely that valuable clients of brokerage firms would be wealthy. This story illustrates that while stock market profits are substantial, most are earned by intermediaries. Those who frequently trade and generate significant profits for brokerage firms rarely become yacht owners themselves.\nMerrill Lynch annually has a dozen or so brokers earning over a million dollars. However, their truly valuable clients are not exceptionally wealthy individuals. Wealthy people are usually busy making money and don\u0026rsquo;t have the time for frequent trading. They wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be considered valuable clients. Only those who constantly engage in short-term trading are the major contributors to transaction fees and the most loyal customers of brokerage firms.\nIn 1990, a scholar wrote a bestselling book on securities investment, earning about 1 million NTD. He was overjoyed, as it was a considerable sum for a writer. However, his friend at a brokerage firm mocked him, saying, \u0026ldquo;Your three years of hard work only earned you the equivalent of one month\u0026rsquo;s salary for a broker in our company.\u0026rdquo;\nRetail investors, your name is weakness.\nA Losing Game # The stock market comprises four main participants: intermediaries, major shareholders, large investors, and retail investors. Intermediaries include brokerage firms, the government, and information providers like newspapers, magazines, financial channels, and software companies. Regardless of market outcomes, intermediaries always profit, and their profits increase with trading volume and frequency. Major shareholders are company management or those with significant equity stakes. They have ample capital, resources, and information, giving them a winning edge. Large investors have more capital than retail investors, affording them a higher probability of success.\nIntermediaries and Large Investors Are the Winners\nThe original purpose of financial markets was to channel funds from the public to businesses, which then invest and share profits with investors. However, based on the analysis above, listed companies\u0026rsquo; earnings are insufficient to cover the costs of intermediaries, let alone distribute profits to retail investors. For retail investors to profit, they must outperform the other three players. In short-term trading, retail investors face intermediaries who always win, major shareholders who are guaranteed to win, and large investors with a higher probability of winning. In this game, retail investors have no chance.\nMost short-term trading failures are attributed to lack of skill or bad luck. In reality, a calm analysis reveals a guaranteed losing game.\nHow to Win Without Fighting\nAs a retail investor, how can you navigate this game against major shareholders, intermediaries, and large investors? The simplest solution: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t play!\u0026rdquo;\nListed companies, on average, generate profits annually, and successful companies grow increasingly profitable. Therefore, not investing idle funds means missing out on long-term gains. The \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t play\u0026rdquo; strategy doesn\u0026rsquo;t advocate avoiding the stock market altogether. Instead, it encourages investing and then leaving it alone, minimizing short-term trading.\nBy consistently investing available funds and holding long-term, investors can benefit from both company earnings and overall economic growth. This long-term holding strategy, avoiding the trading game played by intermediaries and large investors, can dramatically shift the investment landscape. If investors buy and hold, intermediaries and major shareholders lose their advantage. Even with substantial capital and insider information, their attempts to manipulate prices won\u0026rsquo;t lure disciplined retail investors into their traps, eliminating the disadvantage faced by smaller investors. Major shareholders, large investors, and retail investors would then stand on equal footing, sharing the benefits of long-term market growth.\nThis \u0026ldquo;immovable mountain\u0026rdquo; strategy transforms retail investors\u0026rsquo; disadvantage into an advantage, shifting the disadvantage to the other players, particularly intermediaries. If investors stop trading frequently, brokerage firms lose transaction fees, the government loses taxes, and financial information providers lose business. With no one to \u0026ldquo;feed\u0026rdquo; them, they might be forced to become buy-and-hold investors themselves.\nThe correct investment philosophy is to profit together, not to defeat others. The truly intelligent strategy is to avoid the competition. As Sun Tzu\u0026rsquo;s Art of War states, \u0026ldquo;The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.\u0026rdquo; The primary consideration in investment strategy should not be defeating others but maximizing profits.\nHow can everyone win? If every investor adopts the strategy presented in this book‚Äî\u0026ldquo;buy any stock, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo;‚Äîand adheres to this simple principle, a win-win situation for all can be achieved.\nFutures markets make casinos pale in comparison.\nAvoid Futures and Margin Trading # In 1995, a single trader\u0026rsquo;s mismanagement of futures trading resulted in a $1.1 billion loss, causing the collapse of Barings Bank, one of Britain\u0026rsquo;s oldest banks. This is not an isolated incident. With the rise of derivative financial products like futures and margin trading (forex, bond margin trading, etc.), such incidents of company collapses or personal bankruptcies due to mismanagement have become increasingly common. Several high-performing listed companies in Taiwan have also faced near-bankruptcy due to losses in futures or margin trading.\nEither Big Wins or Big Losses\nWhat makes futures and margin trading so dangerous? The core issue is the margin trading system itself, which has a high degree of leverage, leading to either significant gains or devastating losses in the short term. The high risk also encourages frequent trading, often multiple times a day. These transaction costs, relative to the margin, are extremely high. The combined effect of frequent trading and high transaction costs pushes the returns from futures and margin trading into significant negative territory.\nA saying circulates in the US securities market: \u0026ldquo;Futures markets make casinos pale in comparison.\u0026rdquo; In other words, futures markets are even more of a gamble than casinos. After paying substantial transaction costs to intermediaries, what profits are left for investors? The author has extensively studied investment history across various countries and has personally participated in the securities market for over a decade. I have never heard of any investor consistently profiting from long-term participation in futures or margin trading. On the contrary, almost everyone I know involved in such activities has ultimately lost money.\nThe purpose of futures and margin trading markets is to provide hedging tools for businesses. Individual investors rarely have such hedging needs. For them, these markets become \u0026ldquo;even more of a gamble than casinos\u0026rdquo; due to the temptation of short-term trading. The author strongly advises readers to avoid futures and margin trading entirely. If reading this book leads you to stay away from these activities, then the book\u0026rsquo;s price has already been repaid, and the author\u0026rsquo;s efforts have been worthwhile.\nOften a Waste of Effort\nThe biggest obstacle to successful financial management is not the difficulty of understanding but the difficulty of implementing what is understood. The principles discussed above are easy to grasp, but understanding doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee implementation. In the volatile investment world, faced with fluctuating prices, investors are often tempted by greed to chase short-term gains or driven by fear to react to price swings. They unknowingly fall into the trap of short-term trading. While the process can be thrilling, it often ends in wasted effort. The true beneficiaries of this game are usually the brokerage firms and the major shareholders manipulating the stocks, leaving retail investors with losses.\nMany people invest in stocks not to build wealth but to prove their intelligence, knowledge, and predictive abilities to others. They constantly analyze and research, overemphasizing market trends and predictions. This leads to impatience, chasing rising prices and selling during dips, attempting to profit from short-term fluctuations. However, this constant buying and selling consumes time, energy, and money in the form of hefty transaction costs, while also creating opportunities for major shareholders and large investors to manipulate stocks. The ultimate result is often a waste of time and money. While knowledge and experience might increase, wealth does not.\nTo succeed in the fast-paced and lucrative investment world, you must cultivate self-discipline. The secret to investment success lies not in knowledge or skill, nor in intelligence or luck, but in self-control. Your investment acumen allows your assets to generate returns, and your patience in long-term holding allows the power of compounding to take you to new levels of wealth. Before succumbing to the temptation of short-term trading, ask yourself: \u0026ldquo;Which wealthy person achieved their fortune through continuous short-term trading?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Which successful stock market investor didn\u0026rsquo;t rely on long-term holding?\u0026rdquo;\nTemporary Glory Leads to Crushing Debt\nIn the history of the Taiwan stock market, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to find examples of individuals who built wealth through short-term trading. There are many who gained fame through short-term speculation, like Lei Bolong, but they often ended up heavily in debt and even faced imprisonment. This is not unique to Taiwan; the same holds true for the US stock market. The author has studied renowned American investors and has never found a prominent figure whose strategy primarily involved short-term trading. Long-term wealth accumulation through short-term trading is virtually unheard of.\nStock investment is a vital path to personal wealth creation and a crucial source of long-term capital for businesses. However, using the wrong approach can lead to financial ruin instead of prosperity. Listed companies issue stocks to raise capital, and if these funds are then misused in speculative games, it can be detrimental to individuals, society, and the nation.\nStockholders are company owners with the inherent rights to profit sharing and residual asset distribution. Therefore, the company\u0026rsquo;s profits will eventually be distributed to shareholders as dividends. With patience, the wealth generated by the company ultimately belongs to the investors.\nTherefore, I urge all readers to avoid the game of short-term trading. Throughout history, no renowned investor has achieved wealth through short-term speculation. Based on the author\u0026rsquo;s observations, the vast majority of those who engage in short-term trading lose money, and many face financial ruin.\n1. True profits come not from short-term trading skills but from the discipline of long-term holding.\n2. In the long run, short-term traders inevitably lose. There are no exceptions.\n","date":"13 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005970/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law XI","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"13 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/peter-lynch/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Peter Lynch","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"13 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/short-term-trading/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Short-Term Trading","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"13 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/stocks/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Stocks","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-13","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%8F%8D%E5%90%91%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÂèçÂêëÊäïËµÑ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-13","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%BD%BC%E5%BE%97%E6%9E%97%E5%A5%87/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÂΩºÂæó¬∑ÊûóÂ•á","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-13","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%88%90%E9%95%BF%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÊàêÈïøÊäïËµÑ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-13","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E7%9F%AD%E7%BA%BF%E6%93%8D%E4%BD%9C/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Áü≠Á∫øÊìç‰Ωú","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/diversification/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Diversification","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/efficient-market-hypothesis/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Efficient Market Hypothesis","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/investment-and-financial-management/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Investment and Financial Management","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/long-term-investment/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Long-Term Investment","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/market-forecasting/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Market Forecasting","type":"tags"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law ‚Ö®: Grasping the General Market Trend # Basing investment decisions on technical analysis\noften indicates a lack of experience.\nIn most cases, it won\u0026rsquo;t make you money.\nThe Blind Spots of Forecasting and Analysis # The reason many investors engage in frequent short-term trading, besides being attracted by price fluctuations, is mainly due to the so-called \u0026ldquo;experts\u0026rdquo; who flood the investment market with constant analysis and forecasts, providing investors with specious advice. This leads investors to frantically chase the \u0026ldquo;buy low, sell high\u0026rdquo; principle. Let\u0026rsquo;s discuss whether forecasting and analysis are truly effective. Can they genuinely help investors make a fortune?\nIs Technical Analysis Effective?\nIn April 1993, the Taiwan Economic Daily published an article titled, \u0026ldquo;Success in Stocks Depends on Entry and Exit Timing.\u0026rdquo; This led many to believe that the most crucial task in investment analysis is determining the right moments to buy and sell.\nThe average investor believes the golden rule for wealth in the stock market is \u0026ldquo;buy low, sell high.\u0026rdquo; They also believe the key to success lies in accurately grasping these timing opportunities. Consequently, countless investors try every means to predict future stock price trends to determine optimal buying and selling points. In their quest for the Midas touch, various methods, from the scientific to the absurd, and even the supernatural, such as astrology and market horoscopes, have emerged. Currently, the most widely used method is \u0026ldquo;technical analysis.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the author\u0026rsquo;s humble opinion, technical analysis\u0026rsquo;s popularity in the global investment market, and its continued prevalence among Taiwanese investors, stems from the fact that it appears sophisticated yet not overwhelmingly complex, thus attracting many novice investors. These beginners often believe they must possess some secret technique to navigate the stock market, leading them to prioritize learning technical analysis upon entering the market.\nTechnical analysis originated from the Dow Theory in the 1930s, after which various technical analysis methods sprung up like mushrooms. From the 1940s to the 1960s, technical analysis was highly popular in the US stock market. However, with the advent of the Random Walk Theory, and the observation that most users of technical analysis ended up worse off, its popularity began to wane. By the 1980s, when the author was studying investment analysis in the US stock market, established investment analysts rarely mentioned technical analysis. At the time, if an investor claimed to use technical analysis for investment decisions, it implied inexperience and a high probability of losing money.\nTechnical analysis involves studying and analyzing past price trends and volume data to determine buying and selling timings. Its fundamental assumption is that history repeats itself. Therefore, by identifying the patterns of stock price movements, one can accurately predict future trends.\nBeating the Market is a Pipe Dream\nNumerous empirical studies by scholars have revealed many problems and controversies surrounding technical analysis. Briefly summarized:\nHistorical patterns don\u0026rsquo;t always repeat. Even if technical analysis has been effective for decades, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee future success. If a particular technical analysis method consistently succeeds, its widespread adoption will eliminate its potential profits. The collective actions of technical analysts can create price patterns. This means the price isn\u0026rsquo;t reflecting a correct prediction but rather the analysts\u0026rsquo; actions. Some technical indicators rely on comparisons with past data. These values can change due to time and environment, making past standards inapplicable to the present. If you were given a past stock chart and asked to devise a profitable investment strategy, everyone would understand \u0026ldquo;buy low, sell high.\u0026rdquo; Profiting from trading in such a scenario would be easy. However, investing is about the future. Future price movements are complex and unpredictable; no one possesses a future stock chart. So, is \u0026ldquo;buy low, sell high\u0026rdquo; still a suitable investment strategy? The answer is no. The reason is simple: no one can predict market highs and lows in advance.\nUsing previously successful technical analysis methods doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee future success in beating the market, as excess returns can be random. Furthermore, concluding that technical analysis is effective based on occasional or random excess returns is misleading. While technical analysis might yield short-term gains, it cannot consistently outperform the market in the long run.\nA student once asked me, if the market follows a random walk and technical analysis is ineffective, why are some technical analysis methods accurate at times? Claiming technical analysis is ineffective means it can\u0026rsquo;t generate long-term excess profits, not that its predictions are always wrong. Technical analysis can sometimes be accurate, just like random guesses can be accurate. Therefore, technical analysis isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily inaccurate; its accuracy is comparable to guessing.\nThe Trap of Short-Term Trading\nAnother significant drawback of technical analysis is that its methods focus on identifying buy and sell points. These points constantly emerge, forcing investors to frequently buy and sell, trapping them in short-term trading and eroding returns through transaction costs. The ineffectiveness of technical analysis means that, on average, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t generate excess returns over the long term. In other words, while sometimes accurate, it ultimately underperforms the market\u0026rsquo;s average return (buy-and-hold strategy).\nYou might have used technical analysis methods with seemingly good results. I admit some methods can be effective, but investors often overlook transaction costs. Considering these costs, returns from technical analysis are unlikely to be high. Furthermore, the effectiveness of any technical analysis method is inconsistent, making long-term high returns improbable.\nTechnical analysis exhausts investors, leading to significant losses. Investors should abandon it and adopt a long-term \u0026ldquo;buy-and-hold\u0026rdquo; strategy to benefit from long-term market growth. It\u0026rsquo;s crucial to understand that market risk is inherent in any investment strategy. Investors should be mentally prepared and avoid excessive optimism about short-term returns. Profitable investing relies on correctly judging the overall market direction. Obsessively seeking investment rules from past data, even if profitable, will likely incur time and effort costs exceeding the returns.\nIf you still believe technical analysis can lead to riches, ask yourself: who has become wealthy solely through technical analysis?\nBlind faith in predictions is worse than no prediction at all. Prediction is more art than science.\nThe Only Certainty is Uncertainty # The biggest mistake in investment strategies is overconfidence in prediction. If you\u0026rsquo;ve tirelessly searched for prediction methods without success, or your developed methods are unreliable and unprofitable, don\u0026rsquo;t be discouraged. All predictions face the same challenges.\nLike you, forecasting experts cannot predict the future. If they possessed a crystal ball, they would be wealthy, not making a living from predictions. If this logic isn\u0026rsquo;t convincing, ask yourself: \u0026ldquo;Which self-made millionaire or consistently successful long-term investor has relied solely on prediction?\u0026rdquo; The answer is none.\nInvestment Performance is Unrelated to Predictive Ability\nPeople often assume investment success hinges on predictive ability. Those who predict better supposedly perform better, while investment failures are attributed to poor prediction. However, this isn\u0026rsquo;t true. Most successful investors admit their inability to predict the future. They have no preconceived notions, and their success stems from sound strategies, not accurate predictions.\nDuring my studies in the US, when I first dabbled in the US stock market, I shared the common belief that Wall Street analysts were remarkable and highly skilled at predicting market trends. After graduating from UC Berkeley in 1987, I left academia for a position at a major US brokerage firm, largely driven by the desire to learn from renowned analysts at Merrill Lynch.\nAt Merrill Lynch, I witnessed these analysts firsthand. After numerous interactions, I realized they couldn\u0026rsquo;t accurately predict future stock prices. Some didn\u0026rsquo;t even invest in stocks themselves. I often called analysts, asking which stocks to buy and when the market would rise. One analyst, perhaps tired of my persistent inquiries, frankly told me, \u0026ldquo;Think about it. If I knew which stocks would rise and when the market would go up, would I be stuck working as an analyst?\u0026rdquo; It was then I understood that analysts don\u0026rsquo;t possess predictive powers.\nUpon returning to Taiwan, I observed that local newspapers and magazines were filled with \u0026ldquo;Expert Predictions\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Analyst Market Forecasts.\u0026rdquo; I interacted with several well-known analysts, studying their predictions carefully. My conclusion: there were no superior predictions in the Taiwan stock market. These analysts and experts couldn\u0026rsquo;t accurately grasp the market\u0026rsquo;s future direction.\nAnalysts Rely on Hype\nWhy do so many analysts and experts constantly make predictions in the media? The reason is simple: supply follows demand. Readers crave these predictions, prompting newspapers and magazines to create dedicated columns. Experts often publish predictions not because they possess foresight but because readers believe experts have superior knowledge of the future and eagerly seek their opinions. Newspapers cater to this demand by soliciting expert articles. Similarly, why do brokerage firms employ so many analysts to interpret market trends for clients? To meet customer needs. In a competitive environment, analyst insights are considered a crucial service. Brokerage firms readily provide this service because research indicates that investors guided by experts tend towards short-term trading, generating higher commissions for the firms.\nThis demonstrates investors\u0026rsquo; heavy reliance on expert predictions, which arise from investor demand. The problem is that the stock market is unpredictable. No one can make accurate predictions, a widely acknowledged fact. Yet, most investors still believe in expert forecasts.\nA US poll once asked, \u0026ldquo;Who lies to the public the most?\u0026rdquo; The results: weather forecasters, stock analysts, and economic commentators. This reveals not that expert predictions are always inaccurate but the public\u0026rsquo;s unwavering faith in them, leading to heightened expectations. These professions often require making future predictions under the assumption that \u0026ldquo;experts must be able to predict; those who can\u0026rsquo;t predict aren\u0026rsquo;t experts.\u0026rdquo; This pressure compels many researchers and analysts to publish future predictions, despite the inherent uncertainty. Being wrong is inevitable, and being perceived as liars arises from the public\u0026rsquo;s initial belief in their predictions, leading to feelings of deception when they prove incorrect.\nYou might question this, citing instances of analysts who made remarkably accurate predictions, causing stocks to surge upon their recommendations. However, have you noticed that these seemingly prophetic \u0026ldquo;experts\u0026rdquo; are rarely the same person and often disappear after a while? In reality, these experts, unless backed by market manipulators who profit from deceiving retail investors, are simply experiencing probability at play. Occasional streaks of accuracy are possible but not sustainable.\nStrategies to Lure Retail Investors\nMarket manipulators aiming to pump and dump a stock, besides securing cooperation from major shareholders, must create a forecasting \u0026ldquo;expert\u0026rdquo; who, through media appearances, convinces retail investors to buy in. As major shareholders lock up their shares and more investors join, it creates the illusion that the \u0026ldquo;expert\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; predictions are coming true, causing the stock price to surge.\nJoseph Granville was a popular technical analyst in the early 1980s. His remarkably accurate market predictions in the late 1970s made him famous. His large following gave him considerable market influence; his words could move the market by tens of points. However, in early 1982, he predicted a major market crash, advising his followers to sell all their stocks. Instead, the market surged from around 700 to over 1200 points within five months. Those who heeded his advice missed a significant bull market, and Granville faded into obscurity.\nI advise investors to avoid stocks being manipulated. Even if you make small profits initially, one loss could wipe out all gains and more. Another reason: manipulated stocks involve major shareholder intervention. These shareholders, instead of focusing on business operations and profits, are interested in quick gains through market manipulation, indicating poor management. Such companies aren\u0026rsquo;t worth investing in. Their scheme relies on retail investors\u0026rsquo; money; retail investors have little chance of winning. If retail investors could profit from this game, what would be the point for the major shareholders?\nAnother possibility for accurate predictions is simply probability. Predictions are often diverse and contradictory, with some bullish, some bearish, and some expecting consolidation. Inevitably, someone will be right, purely due to luck or higher guessing probability.\nMore Wrong Guesses Than Right\nHowever, most people don\u0026rsquo;t think this way. When experts make several consecutive correct predictions, they gain credibility and are hailed as \u0026ldquo;prophets.\u0026rdquo; People easily forget past incorrect predictions, treating the \u0026ldquo;prophet\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; words as gospel. This is extremely dangerous. Investors overlook the possibility of future incorrect predictions.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not entirely dismissing analysts and experts. In the unpredictable investment world, many investors need expert guidance. Analyst data and forecasts can be valuable reference material. My point is, regardless of your attitude towards expert predictions, remember: the future is dynamic and unpredictable. Investment risk is an unavoidable reality and must be managed.\nIn early 1990, as the market peaked, most experts predicted continued growth. A prominent \u0026ldquo;market prophet\u0026rdquo; confidently proclaimed the market would reach 15,000 points within six months and 20,000 within a year. Major media outlets reported this prediction. The reality was starkly different. Within six months, the market plummeted 2,000 points, shocking all experts. Did these experts disappear? No. Newspapers and magazines still feature expert market forecasts. The reason is simple: investors are \u0026ldquo;used to\u0026rdquo; hearing these predictions and many remain captivated by them.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t advocate completely ignoring predictions. Predictions have value, and good predictions are worth considering. However, whether you believe in predictions or not, and regardless of the predictor\u0026rsquo;s reputation, remember: the future is fluid and unpredictable. Investment risk is an inherent part of investing and must be managed.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need predictive abilities to invest well or make money in the market. In this complex and volatile market, the only certainty is uncertainty. In the investment world, profits come from choosing the right investments and holding them long-term, not from predicting market movements. In summary, consider expert predictions, but remember they are just predictions. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly trust them.\nThere are no experts in the stock market, only winners and losers.\nTrust Yourself, Not the Experts # Some believe that lacking professional expertise makes achieving wealth through investment incredibly difficult. Yet, many who don\u0026rsquo;t understand stocks or real estate still achieve financial success through investing. Most successful investors aren\u0026rsquo;t investment professionals, and investment professionals aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily successful investors. This shows that expertise isn\u0026rsquo;t a prerequisite for wealth creation through investment.\nInvestment and financial management aren\u0026rsquo;t inherently complex. The perceived complexity and reliance on experts stem from investors\u0026rsquo; inability to cope with uncertainty, overcomplicating simple matters and turning financial management into a source of anxiety and confusion. This anxiety hinders rational decision-making, leading people to constantly seek external opinions.\n10 Experts, 11 Opinions\nThe inability to handle uncertainty creates the illusion that foresight or profound analytical skills are necessary for successful investing, leading to the belief that only \u0026ldquo;experts\u0026rdquo; can manage finances effectively. Consequently, many entrust their financial decisions to experts, who often offer conflicting \u0026ldquo;expert opinions.\u0026rdquo; Ten experts can have eleven different views, further complicating the investment world and adding to investor confusion.\nBasing your financial decisions solely on expert opinions is extremely dangerous. Ultimately, investment responsibility lies with the individual. Investors should enhance their financial literacy and become their own experts. Financial management doesn\u0026rsquo;t require extensive professional knowledge. By following a few basic principles outlined in this book and acting accordingly, you can achieve wealth without relying on experts. With the right investment philosophy, you might even outperform them.\nTherefore, I urge investors to take immediate action, start investing, and stop asking questions like \u0026ldquo;When will the market rise?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Which stock should I buy?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Should I sell my xxx stock now?\u0026rdquo; These questions are pointless; no one knows the correct answers.\nIn 1983, when I began my doctoral studies at UC Berkeley, I started helping Taiwanese entrepreneurs invest in US stocks. To excel at this, I dedicated immense effort to stock analysis, often neglecting sleep and meals. For one to two years, I practically lived in the Berkeley Haas School of Business library, devouring every investment book and analyzing all available stock information. I learned various technical, fundamental, and market analysis techniques. To develop my unique investment analysis and prediction methods, I utilized Berkeley\u0026rsquo;s advanced computers and extensive stock databases, writing programs to simulate various investment approaches. This proved futile; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a satisfactory method. It was all for naught.\nIf anyone truly knew when the market would rise or which stock to buy, they would be wealthy enough not to need a job as an analyst or expert. I reiterate: even without knowing \u0026ldquo;when the market will rise\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;which stock to buy,\u0026rdquo; you can still achieve wealth through investing. Stop wasting time on these questions. Countless people have dedicated their lives to researching them since the inception of the stock market. They became stock experts but didn\u0026rsquo;t achieve wealth through investing.\nInaction and Effortless Gains\nFinancial management doesn\u0026rsquo;t require excessive time. Those who spend less time on it often perform better.\nStatistics show that Taiwanese stock investors spend an average of 3.12 hours daily on stock analysis and market watching. Is stock picking difficult? Is making money in the stock market challenging? Constantly chasing price fluctuations, what are your returns? Those who diligently study stocks often lose the most money.\nA common investor mistake is giving up. They eagerly enter during bull markets and become disheartened during bear markets, abandoning the market entirely. Lacking patience and perseverance, they rarely succeed. Conversely, those with less financial acumen, admitting their inability to time the market, often persevere and ultimately fare better.\nThe path to investment wealth is simple: effortless gains. The investment strategy presented‚Äî\u0026ldquo;buy any stock, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo;‚Äîcan be summarized as \u0026ldquo;do nothing, gain effortlessly.\u0026rdquo;\nWho wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want effortless gains? Surprisingly, most investors can\u0026rsquo;t achieve this. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no such thing as a free lunch\u0026rdquo; is a widely known principle. Applying this to investment, people assume they must master complex techniques and work harder than others to profit. Intuitively, they believe more knowledge and effort equate to higher returns. This might hold true in other areas, but in finance, the opposite is often true. Knowledge and effort don\u0026rsquo;t significantly contribute to investment returns. Knowing more and constantly monitoring the market encourages impulsive trading, leading to \u0026ldquo;effort without gain.\u0026rdquo;\nInaction is Superior to Action\nEven investment gurus like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch admit they can\u0026rsquo;t predict market movements. Admitting ignorance might seem foolish, but it\u0026rsquo;s the beginning of financial wisdom. Being \u0026ldquo;foolish\u0026rdquo; enough to \u0026ldquo;buy any stock, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; is the starting point of wealth creation. Confucius said, \u0026ldquo;Great wisdom appears foolish.\u0026rdquo; This refers to highly learned individuals who achieve mastery through natural means, without contrivance or cunning. They appear unintelligent but are truly wise. Lao Tzu also said, \u0026ldquo;Great skill appears clumsy,\u0026rdquo; and advocated for \u0026ldquo;governing by non-interference.\u0026rdquo; This strategy, applied to the volatile investment environment, is a sound approach. Unless you have strong conviction about future trends, it\u0026rsquo;s better to ignore the chaos and remain inactive.\nTherefore, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to be an investment expert or possess sophisticated techniques. \u0026ldquo;Do nothing, gain effortlessly\u0026rdquo; is the key to financial wealth. You might think this sounds too simple, even boring. Indeed, it is. But this simplicity is the path to riches and becoming a millionaire. Before acting, ask yourself: \u0026ldquo;Do I want wealth or to be a stock market expert?\u0026rdquo; If you want wealth through stocks, emulate the many who became rich by simply investing and then ignoring the market. Decades later, compounding will make you wealthy. You could also dedicate yourself to becoming a stock market expert, but this rarely leads to riches.\nMy point is, even without knowing \u0026ldquo;when the market will rise\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;which stock to buy,\u0026rdquo; you can still achieve wealth through investing. Short-term market fluctuations are unpredictable, but the long-term trend is upward. Long-term investing is the key to profit.\n\u0026ldquo;Buy any stock, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo;‚Äîso simple, effortless, and seemingly undeserved. While it feels like unearned gain, don\u0026rsquo;t feel guilty. Investing in stocks contributes to economic development. Constant trading harms individual wealth and offers no benefit to the overall economy or society.\nEasier Said Than Done\nSome worry and ask, \u0026ldquo;You advise against saving money in banks. If your book becomes a bestseller and this idea spreads, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it cause a nationwide bank run?\u0026rdquo; This is an unnecessary concern. I\u0026rsquo;ve been advocating against saving money in banks for three years, even before this book\u0026rsquo;s publication. Many who hear this idea nod in agreement, as if enlightened, yet days, months, or years later, their money remains untouched in bank accounts.\nOthers question whether my \u0026ldquo;buy any stock, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; theory, if widely adopted, would force brokerage firms to close, depriving the government of transaction taxes. Again, there\u0026rsquo;s no need for such concerns. Those who frequently engage in short-term trading in stocks, futures, or margin accounts, even after understanding that it only benefits intermediaries, often can\u0026rsquo;t resist continuing their behavior. Like gambling, everyone knows the odds are stacked against them, yet gambling persists.\nI understand that \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t save money in banks,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;avoid short-term trading,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;diversify and hold long-term,\u0026rdquo; are simple in theory but difficult in practice. Nevertheless, I sincerely hope readers can integrate knowledge and action, diversifying most of their assets into stocks and real estate, holding them long-term. Achieving financial freedom is within reach.\n","date":"12 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005968/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law ‚Ö®","type":"posts"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law VIII: Profit When You Buy, Profit When You Sell # Some people do nothing all day,\nunderstand nothing about investing,\nyet become billionaires.\nBuy Randomly, Buy Anytime, Don\u0026rsquo;t Sell # You may already understand the principle of wealth creation: invest money in high-return investment vehicles and hold them for the long term. But you might still have questions: How should you invest? When should you buy? What should you buy? When should you sell?\nThe Highest Realm of Financial Management\nI propose an investment strategy here. This method is arguably the simplest, as everyone can do it; yet it is also the hardest, as few can truly follow it. This strategy is: \u0026ldquo;Buy randomly, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell.\u0026rdquo; You might ask, \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s so difficult about buying randomly, buying anytime, and not selling?\u0026rdquo; If you think it\u0026rsquo;s easy, try it yourself. If you can genuinely do it, then congratulations! You have grasped the essence of investment and financial management, reaching the highest level of investing prowess.\nThe average investor\u0026rsquo;s favorite questions are: \u0026ldquo;What to buy?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;When to buy?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;When to sell?\u0026rdquo; Imagine if someone knew the answers, they would surely keep it a secret and profit themselves. Would they tell you first? Investors often assume experts know when the market will rise or fall, and which stocks to buy. It\u0026rsquo;s as if those who don\u0026rsquo;t know these things are not worthy of being called experts or analysts. However, only true experts admit they don\u0026rsquo;t know when the market will rise or fall. Precisely because no one knows future market movements, investing is worthwhile. It\u0026rsquo;s this uncertainty that creates the potential for high returns. Otherwise, all investment profits would be taken by those with foreknowledge.\nMost people believe that to profit from investing, you must accurately predict market timing, select the right investment targets, and know when to sell. But based on my more than ten years of experience in investment, investment management, and investment research, capturing the perfect entry point is nearly impossible. Even investment gurus like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch admit they don\u0026rsquo;t know when stocks will rise or when to sell.\nYou might be puzzled by how some people, seemingly doing nothing and lacking investment knowledge, become incredibly wealthy. The three principles presented in this book ‚Äì \u0026ldquo;buy randomly, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; ‚Äì are the key factors to their success.\nThe Wealth Creation Method of Hou Boming, Executive Director of Tainan Spinning\nThe three Hou brothers, Boming, Boyu, and Boyi, are the largest shareholders of Tainan Spinning, possessing a fortune exceeding 15 billion. Despite being major tycoons in Southern Taiwan, they maintain a low profile. Hou Boming, in his 40s, can sometimes be found playing pinball at night markets.\nHou Boming\u0026rsquo;s grandfather, Hou Yuli, was a founding figure of Tainan Spinning. After the successive deaths of his grandfather and father, Hou Yongdu, Hou Boming, his two older brothers, and his mother inherited a quarter of Tainan Spinning\u0026rsquo;s shares. They remained passive shareholders, not participating in the company\u0026rsquo;s management, staying completely silent. Their immense wealth only came to light when Hou Yuli\u0026rsquo;s daughter, Hou Yingzu, sued her brothers, Hou Yongdu and Hou Yongsong, and her nephew, Hou Boming, for allegedly misappropriating family assets.\nThe Hou brothers\u0026rsquo; investment strategy is simple: buy stocks and hold them long-term, accumulating wealth through dividends. Some criticize them for lacking business acumen and real estate development skills, but with this simple method, they became one of the top 20 richest families in Taiwan.\nHad they heeded others\u0026rsquo; advice and sold their stocks to pursue business ventures, they might have lost their position among the top 20 wealthiest, perhaps becoming another example of \u0026ldquo;wealth not lasting three generations.\u0026rdquo; If they had deposited their money in the bank, the wealth accumulated by their grandfather 40 years ago might have dwindled to almost nothing due to inflation. With a real return rate of zero in a bank, depositing NT$500,000 annually would take 200 years to reach NT$100 million.\nTo the average person, the Hou brothers\u0026rsquo; approach may seem unremarkable. Yet, their wealth hasn\u0026rsquo;t diminished due to inflation; instead, it has grown year after year. Their grandfather was a multi-millionaire 30 years ago, but their generation has become multi-billionaires. The key lies in investing in high-return vehicles ‚Äì stocks ‚Äì and holding them long-term.\nBlindfolded, throw a dart,\nBuy whichever stock it hits.\nWhat to Buy - Buy Randomly # Everyone says choosing the right investment target is crucial for success, and I agree. But how to choose is a difficult and complex question. The strategy I propose is exceptionally simple, so simple that you might not be able to follow it: \u0026ldquo;Buy randomly.\u0026rdquo;\nMore Accurate than a Broker\u0026rsquo;s Eye\n\u0026ldquo;Buy randomly\u0026rdquo; is so simple! Some suggest pinning the stock market section of The Wall Street Journal to a wall and throwing darts at it, buying whichever stock the dart hits. Scholars conducted an experiment where a monkey, blindfolded, threw darts at stock listings. The resulting portfolio performed remarkably well, even outperforming portfolios managed by professional fund managers.\nWhy is \u0026ldquo;buying randomly\u0026rdquo; a good stock selection method? If you\u0026rsquo;ve studied portfolio diversification theory in finance, you\u0026rsquo;ll understand that as the number of stocks in a portfolio increases (beyond 10), the impact of individual stock factors diminishes. In other words, as long as you diversify, stock selection ability becomes less important. Random selection works. Especially with 30 or 40 different stocks, the overall performance will closely mirror the market.\nBuying randomly sounds simple, even a monkey or a fool could do it. But in reality, it\u0026rsquo;s extremely difficult, so difficult that only a fool could actually do it. I must admit, while I believe in the principle of \u0026ldquo;buying randomly,\u0026rdquo; I can\u0026rsquo;t bring myself to do it when investing my own money.\nAs mentioned earlier, to help my child reach billionaire status by their 40s, I buy them stocks worth tens of thousands of dollars annually. To practice \u0026ldquo;buying randomly,\u0026rdquo; I spread out the stock market section of the newspaper and ask my 4-year-old to pick a stock. However, each time they point to one, I move their hand, saying, \u0026ldquo;Why did you pick this one?\u0026rdquo; Then I ask them to pick another, but I\u0026rsquo;m still not satisfied. This is because I can\u0026rsquo;t bring myself to buy the stocks my child randomly selects. In the end, it\u0026rsquo;s me, the self-proclaimed \u0026ldquo;investment expert\u0026rdquo; dad, who selects a stock after careful analysis and research.\nDespite this, I record the first stock my child picks each year. It\u0026rsquo;s been five years now, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t sold any of the five stocks. Surprisingly, the performance of the five stocks I carefully selected is about the same as the five randomly picked by my child. This further validates that \u0026ldquo;random selection\u0026rdquo; is not only simple but also performs well in the long run.\nNo One Can Guarantee Gains or Losses\nThe purpose of suggesting \u0026ldquo;random selection\u0026rdquo; is not to encourage you to literally throw darts at stock listings, though it\u0026rsquo;s not a bad method. My real intention is to highlight that random selection is sufficient when choosing investments. You don\u0026rsquo;t need excessive caution or to follow expert advice that demands painstaking research. The reason is simple: as mentioned, if you had chosen Cathay Life Insurance 20 years ago and held it, you would be a billionaire today. Conversely, if you had chosen Kuosheng 10 years ago and held it, you would have lost everything. Many experts use this to justify advising investors to be extremely cautious and meticulous in stock selection. The problem is, no matter how knowledgeable or cautious you are, you can\u0026rsquo;t guarantee picking the next Cathay Life Insurance or avoiding the next Kuosheng.\nA key point to consider: You don\u0026rsquo;t need to pick the perfect stock like Cathay Life Insurance to become wealthy. As long as your investment returns are close to the overall market average, you can still become a billionaire. To achieve this, you simply need to \u0026ldquo;diversify and choose randomly.\u0026rdquo;\nAverage investors often fail to understand this, leading them to be overly cautious, spending significant time, effort, and money on analysis, research, seeking hot tips, and consulting experts. This usually leads to two outcomes:\nConfusion: Opinions on which investments are good vary widely, leading to indecision. Unable to find a \u0026ldquo;safe\u0026rdquo; investment, investors often resort to the riskiest long-term move ‚Äì leaving their money in the bank. False Sense of Security: Sometimes, an investment appears excellent from all angles, with most experts endorsing it. This perceived safety often attracts cautious investors, but these \u0026ldquo;safe\u0026rdquo; investments can be the most dangerous. Remember: Investments everyone considers good are often the worst. In mid-1995, almost everyone viewed semiconductor stocks like TSMC and UMC favorably. Many cautious investors flocked to these stocks. A year later, the market was up 30% on average, while TSMC and UMC plummeted, halving in value. While simple, buying randomly is a difficult investment philosophy to embrace. But it teaches us a valuable lesson: Don\u0026rsquo;t overthink stock selection. Diversify your portfolio and choose randomly. Investing can be that simple.\nThe ratio of up days to down days in the stock market is approximately 55:45.\nWhen to Buy - Buy Anytime # Many claim that choosing the right entry point is crucial for investment success, and I agree. However, timing the market is equally difficult and complex. My proposed strategy is simple, so simple you might find it hard to follow: \u0026ldquo;Buy anytime.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Buy anytime\u0026rdquo; means investing your money whenever you have it, regardless of the day or time. In other words, don\u0026rsquo;t keep your money in the bank. Invest any surplus funds beyond your daily needs, regardless of whether you think prices will rise or fall.\nBuy and Wait for the Opportunity\nInvestors often ask, \u0026ldquo;When should I start investing?\u0026rdquo; My answer is \u0026ldquo;Now!\u0026rdquo; Short-term stock prices fluctuate wildly and are unpredictable. You could say, \u0026ldquo;The only predictable thing is unpredictability.\u0026rdquo; Since stocks generally rise in the long term, and future price movements are uncertain, the best approach is to invest and hold long-term, regardless of short-term fluctuations, and wait for the long-term upward trend to emerge.\nStocks tend to have higher returns over the long term, with a higher probability of rising than falling. Statistically, the ratio of up days to down days is approximately 55:45. Therefore, if you ask me if the market will rise or fall tomorrow, my answer is usually: \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know, and nobody in the world knows.\u0026rdquo; But if you insist on a guess, the statistically safer bet is that it will rise.\nSince the guess is always for a rise, the safest approach is to buy whenever you have money. When the probability of rising is higher than falling, and you can\u0026rsquo;t predict tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s movement, the best strategy is to \u0026ldquo;buy and wait for the opportunity,\u0026rdquo; not \u0026ldquo;wait for the opportunity to buy.\u0026rdquo;\nWe often hear older people lamenting, \u0026ldquo;If only I had invested in that stock 30 years ago, I would be\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Perhaps the best time to invest was 20 or 30 years ago, but the second-best time is now. Act as soon as you have the funds, lest you have the same regrets in a few decades. Life is short; how many decades can we afford to waste? How long can we allow ourselves to squander precious time?\nBuying anytime sounds simple, but it\u0026rsquo;s also very difficult. Try it yourself. If you can do it, you possess the basic qualities for investment success. As long as you adhere to the principles of long-term holding and diversified timing, you can buy stocks anytime.\nWhen to Sell - Don\u0026rsquo;t Sell\nBefore investing, prepare to hold for 20 years, research carefully, and after buying, put it aside and forget about it.\nA common investor dilemma is: \u0026ldquo;When should I sell?\u0026rdquo; Some experts say, \u0026ldquo;Choosing the right entry point is hard, choosing the right exit point is even harder.\u0026rdquo; Investment guru Philip Fisher famously advised, \u0026ldquo;If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is‚Äîalmost never.\u0026rdquo; Warren Buffett, who became the richest man in America in 1982 through stock investments, exemplifies this. He holds stocks for an average of 4.5 years. So, my advice on when to sell is: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t sell.\u0026rdquo; Hold long-term and minimize trading.\nLong-term holding avoids frequent trading costs that erode returns. My research shows that with high-return investments like stocks, the longer the holding period, the lower the risk of loss. For example, with sufficient diversification, investing in the Taiwan stock market has never resulted in returns lower than bank interest rates for holding periods exceeding 11 years. This demonstrates that \u0026ldquo;diversify and hold long-term,\u0026rdquo; while seemingly simple, is an optimal investment strategy.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s so hard about not selling? It seems easy enough. But this is the most challenging of all investment rules and the most crucial factor for investment success. The difficulty lies in remaining unwavering, regardless of price fluctuations. This requires achieving the highest realm of financial management: \u0026ldquo;Own the stock, but not the stock price.\u0026rdquo;\nThe typical investor\u0026rsquo;s habit is to ignore a stock after buying it if the price falls, allowing it to continue declining and becoming a long-term loss. Conversely, if the price rises, they happily calculate their profits and readily sell after a 5% to 20% gain. Thus, \u0026ldquo;long-term investing\u0026rdquo; becomes synonymous with being trapped at a high price. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing remarkable about holding a losing stock long-term. The real key to investment success is remaining steadfast even when you\u0026rsquo;re profiting.\nJesse Livermore, author of Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, wrote: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been in Wall Street for many years, made fortunes, and lost them. My fortune-making has never depended on my forecasting ability but on my ability to hold positions firmly, unfazed by market fluctuations. You might find many people in the stock market who are incredibly accurate at predicting entry and exit points, yet they don\u0026rsquo;t make much money. It\u0026rsquo;s rare to find someone who can remain unmoved during a sustained market rally, and I\u0026rsquo;ve found this to be the hardest thing to learn in stock investing. Only by mastering this essence can investors make a fortune.\u0026rdquo;\nEndure the Falls, Wait Out the Rises\nTraditional thinking dictates: Buy low, sell high. However, a new perspective redefines investing as: selecting appropriate investment targets and holding them long-term. Successful investing requires mastering the eight-character mantra: \u0026ldquo;Endure the falls, wait out the rises.\u0026rdquo; Never be disheartened by price drops or tempted to sell at the first sign of a rally. Maintain a long-term perspective.\nWhy do most fortunes come from real estate, while fewer are made from stocks? The key is visibility. Real estate prices are largely invisible, while stock prices are constantly displayed. Real estate investors often achieve the \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; mentality, while stock investors, influenced by price fluctuations, rarely do. If stock investors could embrace the \u0026ldquo;buy and hold\u0026rdquo; approach, stock investing would be as powerful as real estate.\nIn the past 20 years, Cathay Life Insurance has consistently been among the top-performing listed companies in Taiwan. What\u0026rsquo;s their secret? They own real estate and stocks, and they buy and hold. This is their business philosophy, and it also applies to personal finance.\nLook at the success stories of investors like Lien Chan, Tsai Wan-lin, and Wang Yung-ching. They all adhered to the principle of \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t sell.\u0026rdquo; Tsai Wan-lin\u0026rsquo;s success stemmed from treating stocks like real estate. The Lien family\u0026rsquo;s success in stocks and real estate comes from their ability to hold long-term and remain unmoved.\nThe more complex the market fluctuations, the simpler the investment method.\nRandom Walk and Efficient Market Hypothesis # I must emphasize that \u0026ldquo;buy randomly, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t just a catchy phrase; it has a theoretical basis. In the 1950s, the American financial and investment community developed a prominent theory: the Random Walk Hypothesis.\nRandom Selection is the Best Strategy\nIt\u0026rsquo;s generally agreed that stock prices, like other commodities, fluctuate unpredictably. The Random Walk Hypothesis states that stock price movements are so complex that they resemble random changes, nearly impossible to predict. This hypothesis highlights the unpredictable nature of stock prices and, more importantly, leads to a simple yet crucial investment method: the Buy-and-Hold strategy, which is essentially \u0026ldquo;buy randomly, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Buy-and-Hold strategy means investing available funds immediately upon availability (rather than predicting market upswings), holding those investments long-term without selling (locking them away and ignoring short-term fluctuations), and selling only when funds are needed (not in anticipation of market downturns). In short, the Buy-and-Hold strategy advocates investing consistently, holding long-term, and selling only when necessary, without trying to time the market. If stock price movements follow the Random Walk Hypothesis, the best investment strategy is random selection and long-term holding ‚Äì the very essence of \u0026ldquo;buy randomly, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell.\u0026rdquo;\nAnother implication of \u0026ldquo;buy randomly, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; is that analysis and prediction are futile. The Efficient Market Hypothesis states that in an efficient market, all information that could affect stock prices is quickly and fully reflected in those prices. By the time you receive information from analysis reports or publications, it\u0026rsquo;s already outdated and incorporated into the price. In other words, in an efficient market, stock prices are always in equilibrium, and no investor can consistently beat the market by collecting and analyzing information to gain excess returns.\nIn-depth Analysis is a Waste of Time\nThe Efficient Market Hypothesis, introduced by renowned financial expert Eugene Fama in the 1970s, emphasizes that you don\u0026rsquo;t need to be an analyst or expert to build wealth through investing. Painstakingly researching and analyzing stocks is a waste of time because most useful information is already reflected in the price. Studying this information offers no advantage. It\u0026rsquo;s better to invest your money and hold long-term.\nThe Efficient Market Hypothesis teaches us: Ignore the noise. Don\u0026rsquo;t waste time, effort, and money gathering information, as it\u0026rsquo;s mostly already priced in and thus worthless. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to learn complex analysis methods because most are ineffective.\nBy adopting the strategy advocated in this book ‚Äì diversification, buying randomly, buying anytime, and not selling ‚Äì you can achieve excellent returns.\n1. Short-term stock price movements are random, making it impossible to predict when prices will rise or fall.\n2. Although short-term stock prices are unpredictable, the long-term trend is upward due to continuous economic growth. Buying and holding stocks long-term, with the compounding effect offsetting risks over time, yields considerable average returns.\n3. Almost all publicly available information is already reflected in stock prices, making it unhelpful for investors.\n4. Most analytical methods used by investors are already factored into stock prices. Using commonly employed analysis techniques will not generate excess returns, meaning you won\u0026rsquo;t outperform the buy-and-hold strategy in the long run.\nFor years, facing the ever-changing investment world, I\u0026rsquo;ve sought a method that transcends the \u0026ldquo;busyness and blindness\u0026rdquo; of financial management. \u0026ldquo;Buy randomly, buy anytime, don\u0026rsquo;t sell\u0026rdquo; is the principle of simplifying complex problems.\n","date":"12 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005967/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law VIII","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"12 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/random-walk-hypothesis/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Random Walk Hypothesis","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/real-estate/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Real Estate","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/technical-analysis/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Technical Analysis","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-12","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%88%86%E6%95%A3%E9%A3%8E%E9%99%A9/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÂàÜÊï£È£éÈô©","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-12","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E9%A2%84%E6%B5%8B/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Â∏ÇÂú∫È¢ÑÊµã","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-12","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%88%BF%E5%9C%B0%E4%BA%A7/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÊàøÂú∞‰∫ß","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-12","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÊäÄÊúØÂàÜÊûê","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-12","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84%E7%90%86%E8%B4%A2/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÊäïËµÑÁêÜË¥¢","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-12","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%95%88%E7%8E%87%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E5%81%87%E8%AF%B4/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÊïàÁéáÂ∏ÇÂú∫ÂÅáËØ¥","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-12","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E9%9A%8F%E6%9C%BA%E6%BC%AB%E6%AD%A5%E7%90%86%E8%AE%BA/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÈöèÊú∫Êº´Ê≠•ÁêÜËÆ∫","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/blue-chip-stocks/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Blue-Chip Stocks","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/books/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Books","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/margin-trading/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Margin Trading","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/mutual-funds/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mutual Funds","type":"tags"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law ‚Ö•: Escaping the Trap of Locked-in Investments # Don\u0026rsquo;t put all your eggs in one basket.\nDiversification and Long-Term Holding # Many investors often ask me: \u0026ldquo;Even if I believe that stocks and real estate have high returns and will rise in the long run, their prices fluctuate. Some investments will make a lot of money, while others will lose a lot of money. What should I invest in? What if the company I invest in goes bankrupt?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;When should I invest? What if I invest at the highest price point?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;When should I sell? What if I sell at the wrong time?\u0026rdquo; These questions reflect the risks inherent in investment and financial management.\nIncrease Returns, Reduce Risks\nThe eight-character mantra of investment and financial management is: Increase returns, reduce risks. The simplest way to increase returns is to invest assets in high-return instruments, such as stocks and real estate. However, high-return investments come with high risks. For example, stock and real estate prices fluctuate, leading to both profits and losses. Therefore, investors seeking high returns must bear the accompanying risks. However, these risks are generally undesirable for most investors. The correct financial management concept is not to avoid investment because of these risks. To achieve high returns, one should venture into investments with these risks, and then find ways to mitigate and minimize their impact.\nTherefore, reducing risks to avoid losses and increasing returns to create wealth are equally important for successful financial management. The primary goal of risk management is to find ways to reduce the risk of loss while increasing investment returns.\nInvesting in high-return targets faces three main risks:\nChoosing the wrong investment target. Choosing the wrong investment timing. Choosing the wrong selling timing. So how can we reduce these risks?\n1. Reduce the risk of choosing the wrong investment target - Diversify investment targets. 2. Reduce the risk of choosing the wrong investment timing - Diversify investment timing. 3. Reduce the risk of choosing the wrong selling timing - Long-term holding.\nReduce the Risk of Choosing the Wrong Investment Target - Diversify Investment Targets\nA conglomerate that owned a private jet once required its CEO and second-in-command to attend an international conference simultaneously. The conference organizers held a cocktail party to welcome these two VIPs. Guests and media eagerly awaited their arrival. Amidst the cheers, only the second-in-command, who had arrived on a private jet, was present. The CEO was still at the international airport going through customs. It turned out that they had taken separate planes to mitigate risk. Indeed, with frequent air disasters, if they had taken the same flight and an accident occurred, it would have severely impacted the company.\nThree thousand years ago, the Phoenicians invested heavily in building ships for international trade, venturing across the oceans. Successful voyages brought immense wealth; shipwrecks caused by hurricanes or typhoons resulted in total loss. Thus, the risks of overseas trade were enormous. A small group became incredibly wealthy through successful trade, while a few were ruined. However, the vast majority, fearing potential disasters, hesitated and missed out on substantial profits. Because few dared to take the risk, the limited supply of ships led to higher profits in maritime trade, benefiting those who invested.\nSomeone then devised an investment method that not only generated trade profits but also mitigated risks: diversification. The approach involved dividing the capital for one ship into ten parts, investing one-tenth in each of ten ships. This diversified the risk.\nDespite precautions, on average, three out of ten invested ships would sink due to storms. However, the profits from the remaining seven ships not only covered the losses but also yielded substantial returns. Diversification reduced risk while maintaining the return rate. The possibility of all ten ships encountering mishaps still existed, but it was minimal, significantly lower than the risk of investing in a single ship.\nThe most effective and widely adopted method for risk reduction is \u0026ldquo;diversification.\u0026rdquo; Diversification simply means increasing the variety of investments. Mark Twain once said, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t put all your eggs in one basket.\u0026rdquo; Distributing eggs across multiple baskets ensures that even if one basket falls, the remaining eggs are safe. This approach aims to reduce risk.\nThe investment environment is unpredictable and constantly changing. Fortuitous investments can yield high returns in the short term, but there\u0026rsquo;s also a high probability that chosen investments could plummet immediately after purchase. Most people avoid this risk by keeping their funds in risk-free instruments like bank deposits or government bonds. However, the correct investment perspective is to invest in \u0026ldquo;high-risk, high-expected return\u0026rdquo; targets to achieve high returns, while employing diversification to mitigate risks.\nInvest in ten ships. Three sink. The remaining ones still generate profits.\nPrinciples of Diversification # The method of diversifying risk has been practiced for millennia. The principle of diversification was introduced in the \u0026ldquo;Portfolio Theory\u0026rdquo; published in 1950 by Dr. Harry Markowitz, the 1990 Nobel laureate in economics. Diversification means increasing the types of investments. For example, when buying stocks, don\u0026rsquo;t buy just one; divide the investment amount and purchase multiple stocks. With sufficient capital, diversify beyond stocks into real estate, gold, art, and other asset classes.\nIncreasing Investment Types Offsets Relative Risk\nDiversification reduces risk because different investment targets don\u0026rsquo;t rise and fall in perfect unison. Even if they do, the magnitude of change varies. When several investments form a portfolio, the portfolio\u0026rsquo;s return is the weighted average of individual investments. Therefore, combining several high-return investments maintains high returns, while the portfolio\u0026rsquo;s risk is reduced as the fluctuations of individual investments offset each other. Increasing the variety of investments in a portfolio decreases the overall portfolio risk. This explains why diversification ‚Äì increasing the types of investments ‚Äì reduces risk.\nTherefore, when investing in stocks, don\u0026rsquo;t just buy one type. Purchase several different stocks. Adequate diversification typically involves investing in ten or more stocks. For investors with limited funds who want diversification, mutual funds are recommended. Most mutual funds invest in 30 or more stocks, so investing $10,000 in a mutual fund is equivalent to buying more than 30 stocks, providing sufficient diversification.\nPrinciples of Diversification\n1. Choose Investment Targets with Greater Negative Correlation\nThe less synchronized the price movements of investments in a portfolio, or the more they move in opposite directions, the better the diversification. Choose investments whose price trends are inversely related to the existing portfolio. For example, gold is a good tool for diversification. Historically, gold has been a high-risk investment, but its price tends to move inversely to stock prices. During major international events like wars, political turmoil, or inflation, stock prices often fall while gold prices rise. Applying this principle to stock investment, choose stocks from different industries for better diversification.\n2. Avoid Excessive Diversification\nWhile working as a consultant at a securities firm, I observed a woman in the VIP room with papers scattered across the table, gesturing frantically as if commanding an army. Assuming she was a major investor, I discreetly inquired with a broker and discovered her total investment was around $300,000, spread across over 30 stocks. While aiming for diversification, she over-diversified, increasing management costs and diminishing returns. Excessive diversification is counterproductive. Even Warren Buffett, with his vast portfolio, invests in only about a dozen stocks.\nGenerally, increasing investment types reduces portfolio risk, but the risk reduction effect diminishes with each added type. Holding numerous investments for fun is acceptable, but if the goal is risk reduction, understand that the diversification effect diminishes with increasing variety. The difference in risk between holding 30 stocks and 20 stocks is negligible. Beyond a certain point, risk reduction plateaus, and further diversification offers no additional benefit.\nBalance diversification against management costs. Diversification aims to reduce risk by increasing investment types across different instruments and targets. While increasing types reduces risk, it increases management costs as tracking multiple assets becomes complex.\nPeter Lynch, in his book \u0026ldquo;One Up On Wall Street,\u0026rdquo; stated: \u0026ldquo;Investing in stocks is like having children ‚Äì if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the ability to raise them, don\u0026rsquo;t have too many. No one says you have to invest in five or more stocks every time.\u0026rdquo;\nMethods of Diversification\nDiversification methods include various investment instruments, targets, and regions:\n1. Diversification of Investment Instruments: Invest in different instruments, such as stocks, real estate, overseas mutual funds, art, and gold.\n2. Diversification of Investment Targets: Invest in various targets. For example, when investing in stocks, don\u0026rsquo;t focus on just one. Spread funds across four or five or more stocks. Avoid concentrating on a few industries, as stocks within the same industry tend to move together. In real estate, if funds allow, invest in different property types like apartments, offices, shops, and studios, and diversify locations.\n3. Diversification of Investment Regions: Diversify investments across different countries or regions. Some investors worry about concentrating assets in one region due to political, war, and exchange rate risks. Distributing assets geographically mitigates these risks.\nConcentrated Investment Requires Confidence\nDiversification reduces the likelihood of worst-case scenarios, but it also eliminates the possibility of the best-case scenarios. Full diversification makes extreme outcomes unlikely, resulting in returns close to the average.\nSome argue for concentrating investments: \u0026ldquo;Put all your eggs in one basket and watch it carefully.\u0026rdquo; Admittedly, many successful investors concentrate their holdings. Few individuals are experts in both stocks and real estate. The choice between diversification and concentration depends on individual circumstances. If you\u0026rsquo;re proficient in a specific investment area, concentration might be preferable, offering potentially higher returns. For example, a real estate expert wouldn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily diversify into stocks. Over-diversification could have hindered their success.\nIf you lack confidence in most investment areas, diversification is recommended. While it might not yield exceptional returns, it protects against significant losses. Diversified returns are close to average returns. As long as the chosen investments tend to appreciate over the long term, like stocks and real estate, achieving average returns is sufficient for wealth building.\nMitigate the risk of incorrect investment timing by diversifying investment timing.\nDiversifying Investment Timing # Diversification applies to both investment targets and timing. To mitigate the risk of mistiming the market, distribute investments over time. Instead of investing a lump sum at once, divide it into portions and invest at different times.\nFoolproof Method for Investment Timing\nTwo methods achieve diversified investment timing. The first is to invest whenever funds are available. A friend of mine invests $10,000 in stocks whenever his bank balance reaches $15,000, keeping his balance below $5,000. He also buys different stocks each time, diversifying both target and timing.\nAnother method is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), which is regularly investing a fixed amount in mutual funds. Investors contribute a set amount at regular intervals (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or annually) at the prevailing net asset value (NAV). A specified amount is automatically deducted from a designated bank account on a specific date each month and invested in a pre-selected mutual fund. Since the investment amount is fixed, but the NAV fluctuates, the number of units purchased varies. This naturally leads to buying more units when prices are low and fewer when prices are high. Over the long term, DCA offers considerable returns and mitigates price fluctuation risks.\nReducing the Risk of Choosing the Wrong Selling Timing - Long-Term Holding\nLong-term holding reduces the likelihood of losses. Choose long-term investment instead of being forced into it after becoming trapped.\nYears ago, during training at Merrill Lynch, a securities analyst stated: \u0026ldquo;Statistically, the stock market rises 55% of the days and falls 45%. The problem is, we don\u0026rsquo;t know which days will be up.\u0026rdquo; The ratio of gains and losses in the Taiwan stock market is similar.\nTherefore, if you, like the experts, don\u0026rsquo;t know whether the market will rise or fall tomorrow, the smartest approach is to guess it will rise. The more you guess, the higher your probability of being correct. If you consistently predict a market rise, the best strategy is: Buy whenever you have money, and hold. This seemingly simple approach is often the most effective. Many fortunes have been built this way.\nStocks and real estate are characterized by high returns and high risks. Due to their inherent risk, prices fluctuate in the short term, but their high returns generate a long-term upward trend. The longer the holding period, the lower the probability of loss. My research on the Taiwan stock market showed that the probability of gains and losses changes with the holding period, as shown below:\nRelationship between Stock Holding Period and Probability of Gain\nHolding Period Probability of Gain (%) Probability of Loss (%) 1 Day 55 45 1 Month 60 40 1 Year 66 34 5 Years 99 1 10 Years 100 0 The table demonstrates that while stock prices fluctuate in the short term, the probability of loss decreases with longer holding periods. A one-day holding has a 45% chance of loss, which decreases to 40% for one month, 34% for one year, and a mere 1% for five years, making a loss almost impossible. Holding for ten years or more eliminates the possibility of loss entirely. Long-term holding not only reduces the likelihood of loss but is also crucial for increasing returns.\nHow can we build wealth from small investments? The key is the power of compounding, which requires both high returns and time. Investing in high-return instruments like stocks and real estate and holding them long-term allows compounding to work its magic, accelerating wealth growth. The longer the holding period (decades), the more apparent the high return rate becomes, and the investment loss risk rapidly decreases.\nThe goal of risk management isn\u0026rsquo;t to eliminate all risk, but to acknowledge its inevitable presence, understand it, analyze it, and then mitigate it. Never wait for absolute safety; it\u0026rsquo;s an illusion. High-expected return investments always carry risk, and no strategy can eliminate all risks.\nDiversification reduces individual investment fluctuations, while long-term holding neutralizes short-term price swings. Investing in stocks and real estate requires accepting short-term and individual investment volatility. By diversifying and holding long-term, these risks are mitigated, reducing overall investment risk. In the long run, this strategy allows investors to benefit from the high returns offered by stocks and real estate.\n","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005965/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law ‚Ö•","type":"posts"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law Seven: Mastering Stock Investment # Choose the right stocks, hold them long-term, and watch their value grow.\nThe Secret to Liu Qiude\u0026rsquo;s Fortune # It is said that Tsai Wan-lin, once Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s richest man and the world\u0026rsquo;s fifth wealthiest individual, declared at a Cathay Life Insurance executive meeting, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t just want to be rich; I want those who strive with me to be rich as well. Those of you present with less than ten million in assets, please raise your hands.\u0026rdquo; The executives remained silent. Not because no one dared to raise their hands, nor because no one possessed such wealth, but because for Cathay Life\u0026rsquo;s senior management, many boasted fortunes exceeding one hundred million.\nLiu Qiude, the current Vice President, who joined Cathay Life in his twenties, became a billionaire by following the right person and investing in the right stock. From the beginning of his career, besides the company\u0026rsquo;s stock options, he consistently invested any spare cash in buying shares from colleagues looking to sell. When Taiwan faced political or economic crises, and some Cathay employees rushed to sell their holdings, he bought them all. Holding these shares for two to three decades, without ever selling, he effortlessly became a billionaire. He himself couldn\u0026rsquo;t say exactly how many shares he owned, stating, \u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t know the exact number of Cathay Life shares until they are all transferred.\u0026rdquo;\nUnsure of His Own Dividend Earnings\nIn 1981, the average price of a Cathay Life share (1000 shares) was about NT$45,000. After 15 years of stock dividends, by 1996, this had increased to 48.7 shares (see table below). Calculated at a market price of NT$160,000 per share, the market value would be approximately NT$7.795 million, a 171-fold increase in 15 years. This impressive growth doesn\u0026rsquo;t even include the cash dividends received over the years. With such a staggering rate of return, it\u0026rsquo;s no wonder Liu Qiude is unsure of his exact share count. He\u0026rsquo;s likely worth well over a billion, perhaps even ten billion or more.\nCathay Life Insurance 15-Year Stock Dividend and Capital Increase\nYear Cash Dividend Stock Dividend Accumulated Shares (Assuming 1 share purchased in 1981) 1981 3 - 1 1982 2 0 1 1983 1 150 1.15 1984 1 300 1.50 1985 1 300 1.94 1986 1.2 300 2.53 1987 1 300 3.28 1988 1 400 4.60 1989 1 500 6.90 1990 1 500 10.35 1991 1.5 500 15.52 1992 1.2 300 20.18 1993 0 250 25.22 1994 1.5 400 35.31 1995 1.5 200 42.37 1996 1.5 150 48.42 Source: (Taiwan) Economic Daily News\nThe Tsai family themselves followed a similar strategy. To maintain control of Cathay Life, they held their shares long-term through investment companies. Tsai Chen-yu, Chairman of First Commercial Bank, pointed out that selling these shares was practically impossible; they had become like real estate. One of the main reasons Tsai Wan-lin became Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s richest man was his ability to hold Cathay Life stock long-term.\nCathay Life isn\u0026rsquo;t the only company that has created immense wealth for ordinary white-collar workers. Professional managers at several other large Taiwanese companies also accumulated significant fortunes. According to the Taiwan Stock Exchange, from the end of 1990 to April 30, 1996, the average return on all stocks was 35.41%. During this period, holding United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) stock would have yielded a return of 726.04%, Acer 421.54%, Tatung 335.88%, China Development Financial Holding Corporation 225.55%, Uni-President Enterprises Corporation 191.30%, and Nan Ya Plastics Corporation 123.77%. These examples demonstrate that long-term investment in blue-chip stocks can lead to substantial gains.\nThe higher the economic growth rate, the higher the average long-term stock market return.\nWhy Stocks Offer High Returns # Why is long-term stock investment profitable? First, I must clarify a key concept that all stock investors should understand. Investing in stocks generates profits primarily because the companies you invest in earn money, which ultimately belongs to the shareholders. Your profit doesn\u0026rsquo;t rely on other investors losing money.\nStocks represent ownership in a company. Stockholders are shareholders of the enterprise, and they have two inherent rights: the right to share in the company\u0026rsquo;s profits and the right to distribute remaining assets. If the company is profitable, the profits ultimately go to the shareholders. Similarly, when a company owns assets, those assets ultimately belong to the shareholders. Therefore, investing in profitable or asset-rich companies can, in the long run, not only yield dividends from corporate earnings but also a share of the value when assets are liquidated.\nAverage Stock Market Return of 17%-18%\nThe long-term price appreciation of stocks is primarily based on two factors:\n(1) Increased corporate profitability leads to higher dividends for shareholders, thus driving up stock prices.\n(2) An increase in the value of a company\u0026rsquo;s assets, such as real estate or investments in other stocks, ultimately benefits shareholders, therefore causing stock prices to rise.\nConsequently, if a company\u0026rsquo;s profitability continues to rise, or the value of its assets, like real estate, continues to appreciate, stock prices will inevitably rise in the long run, and shareholder returns will increase accordingly.\nOver the past few decades, Taiwanese companies have experienced stable profit growth and rising real estate prices, resulting in stock market returns far exceeding bank deposit interest rates. Data shows that over the past 25 years, the average annual return on the Taiwan stock market has been around 17%-18%. In Europe, the United States, Japan, and other developed countries, the average annual return over a 10-year period is typically between 12%-17%. Simply put, the higher the economic growth rate, the higher the average long-term stock market return.\nAccording to research by several scholars, the Taiwan Weighted Stock Index, starting at 100 points in 1966, reached 12,682 points over 27 years, before falling back to 2,458 points by the end of 1993. This translates to an average annual return of over 17%. These calculations assume that investors consistently bought stocks whenever they had funds and held them until the present without selling.\nThe Taiwan Stock Exchange conducted another study showing that if you had invested in the stock market 20 years ago and held your investments until the end of 1994 without trading, your return would have been at least 13.7 times your initial investment, with a maximum potential return of 1,384 times. This demonstrates the impressive potential of the Taiwan stock market.\nLearning from the past can inform the future. The Taiwan stock market has historically delivered high long-term returns. Even in recent years, investors who avoided the frenzy of speculative buying and instead opted for diversified, long-term holdings have seen decent returns. Looking ahead, I firmly believe that readers who adhere to the principles of diversification and long-term holding can still achieve substantial results through stock investment.\nStock Investment vs. Real Estate Investment\nThis book recommends two investment tools with high potential returns: stocks and real estate. Which is better? The answer depends on individual financial circumstances, product knowledge, risk tolerance, and tax situation. There\u0026rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all solution. However, stock investment offers several advantages over real estate:\nReal estate investment requires larger capital, often over NT$1 million, which can be a barrier for young people entering the workforce. Stock investment, on the other hand, can be started with just tens of thousands, or even a few thousand NT dollars.\nLong-term stock investment generally incurs lower taxes than real estate. In Taiwan, stock investments are exempt from capital gains tax, with the primary tax being securities transaction tax. Long-term investors who avoid frequent trading pay limited taxes, and capital gains upon selling are tax-free. Real estate investment requires annual property and land taxes, and transaction taxes upon sale.\nStock trading is simpler than real estate transactions. Buying or selling listed stocks requires just a phone call, and payment is made via remittance. Purchased shares are held by a centralized depository, adding to the convenience. Real estate transactions involve complex procedures for transferring ownership, which can be time-consuming. Property management and maintenance can also be demanding.\nIn conclusion, for investors who diversify and hold long-term, stocks are an excellent investment tool for individuals and families. Unfortunately, most stock investors are unable to withstand the fluctuations of the market and the temptation of short-term gains. Frequent trading often leads to losses due to high transaction costs. This explains why, despite the high average long-term returns of the stock market, few people become wealthy through stock investment.\nCan Stocks Maintain High Returns in the Future?\nInvestors often ask me, \u0026ldquo;The high average annual returns of over 20% in the past were due to Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s rapid economic growth over the past two to three decades. Now that Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s economic growth has slowed, can we still expect such high returns in the future?\u0026rdquo;\nIf the question is whether the Taiwan stock market can maintain an average annual return of over 30%, I believe that\u0026rsquo;s unlikely. A country or region\u0026rsquo;s stock market return is directly influenced by the profitability of its companies, which is essentially linked to the economic growth rate. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s economy is maturing. While the average annual growth rate was around 9% for the past few decades, it\u0026rsquo;s now around 6%, and this trend is expected to continue.\nWith a declining economic growth rate, it\u0026rsquo;s improbable that the stock market will maintain returns above 20%. However, I estimate that future stock returns should remain above 15%. This is based on the observation that in developed economies like the US, Japan, and Europe, long-term stock returns remain between 10%-15% even after their economies mature. Although Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s economic growth rate may decrease, a 10% growth rate is still impressive compared to other regions, making Taiwanese stocks a worthwhile investment. Furthermore, Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s increasing financial liberalization is likely to attract foreign investment, which will further boost the stock market\u0026rsquo;s performance.\nUntapped gold mines are plentiful; careful selection leads to boundless profits.\nChoosing the Right Stocks # Generally, stocks can be categorized into four types: listed stocks, over-the-counter (OTC) stocks, unlisted stocks, and mutual funds. Each type has distinct characteristics that investors should understand to avoid regrets.\nVarying Returns, Liquidity, and Security\nListed stocks are traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. They offer high long-term average returns, good liquidity, transparent financial and business operations, centralized trading with fair market pricing, low taxes for long-term investors (exempt from capital gains tax), and dividends eligible for tax exemptions. Listed stocks offer greater security than unlisted stocks. I recommend that readers with long-term savings consider diversifying their investments in listed stocks and holding them long-term.\nOTC stocks are traded on the over-the-counter market through negotiated pricing. The trading mechanism is similar to listed stocks, but with lower trading volume and liquidity. Generally, the listing requirements for OTC stocks are less stringent than for listed stocks, with lower requirements for capital and profitability, resulting in lower security. One disadvantage of OTC stocks is that their dividends are not eligible for tax exemptions.\nUnlisted stocks are not traded on either the stock exchange or the OTC market. They have lower liquidity, no fair market price, lack transparent financial and business operations, and are not subject to regulatory oversight by the Securities and Futures Bureau (SFB) and the stock exchange, resulting in higher risk and lower security. Their dividends are also ineligible for tax exemptions. While unlisted stocks offer higher potential returns and the possibility of discovering hidden gems, their lack of oversight makes them risky. I recommend focusing on listed stocks, which are sufficient for building wealth. Invest in unlisted stocks only if you have a thorough understanding of the company, its valuation, and trust in its management.\nThe Best Tool for Beginner Stock Investors\nMutual funds, or investment trust funds, pool money from small investors, entrusting it to professional investment management companies. Investment experts manage these funds with a diversified approach, and the returns belong to the original investors. Mutual funds are classified into open-end and closed-end funds based on their issuance and trading methods.\nOpen-end funds allow investors to buy and sell shares at any time based on the net asset value. The total amount of the fund fluctuates as investors buy and sell shares. Closed-end funds have a fixed number of shares. Investors wishing to purchase these funds must buy from existing shareholders. Similarly, existing shareholders must sell their shares on the open market; they cannot redeem them from the issuing company. Funds traded on the stock exchange are closed-end funds, and their transaction tax is only 1%.\nMutual funds are professionally managed by experts and offer diversification, generally providing good returns. However, their long-term average returns may be lower than the overall market due to management fees, custodian fees, transaction fees, and other expenses. Because of their smaller investment units and lower risk compared to listed stocks, mutual funds are an ideal investment tool for beginners. To avoid long-term fees, I recommend index funds, such as the Formosa Fund or CTBC Financial ETF 0050, which offer better long-term returns.\nThis book primarily recommends investing in listed stocks due to their stable long-term average returns. Unless you have specific reasons for investing in other types of stocks, you should allocate most of your funds to listed stocks or stock mutual funds. The most important reason is that long-term investment in listed stocks is sufficient for building wealth.\nMargin Trading is Unsuitable for Listed Stock Investment\nSome investors ask, \u0026ldquo;If the long-term return on stocks is higher than the margin interest rate, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t margin trading accelerate wealth accumulation?\u0026rdquo; Theoretically, yes. If you can diversify and hold listed stocks long-term, margin trading can leverage financial leverage to accelerate wealth growth. However, in practice, most people who use margin trading for stock investment lose money.\nWhy? The reason is simple. It\u0026rsquo;s the same reason why many investors lose money in the stock market despite its high long-term average returns. Daily stock price fluctuations tempt investors to chase short-term gains. They become driven by greed and fear, leading to frequent trading, often buying high and selling low, which ultimately results in losses.\nThis behavior is already prevalent with fully funded stock purchases. Margin trading exacerbates the problem. The leverage magnifies the gains and losses, further tempting investors to chase short-term profits while increasing the psychological pressure. This leads to even more frequent trading and ultimately greater losses.\nMy research on margin trading balances for listed stocks shows that margin balances are lower when stock prices are low. When prices rise significantly, investors begin using margin, with margin balances peaking when stock prices are high. This indicates that investors are often hesitant to use margin when they should, and aggressively use it when they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t, when prices are already high. In short, margin trading for listed stocks often leads to mistakes and should generally be avoided.\n","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005966/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law ‚Ö¶","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/risk-management/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Risk Management","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/stock-investment/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Stock Investment","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/taiwan-stock-market/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Taiwan Stock Market","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-11","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%85%B1%E5%90%8C%E5%9F%BA%E9%87%91/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÂÖ±ÂêåÂü∫Èáë","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-11","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%88%86%E6%95%A3%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÂàÜÊï£ÊäïËµÑ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-11","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%8F%B0%E6%B9%BE%E8%82%A1%E5%B8%82/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Âè∞ÊπæËÇ°Â∏Ç","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-11","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E7%BB%A9%E4%BC%98%E8%82%A1/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Áª©‰ºòËÇ°","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-11","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E8%82%A1%E7%A5%A8%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ËÇ°Á•®ÊäïËµÑ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-11","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E8%9E%8D%E8%B5%84/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ËûçËµÑ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-11","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E9%A3%8E%E9%99%A9%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"È£éÈô©ÁÆ°ÁêÜ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/credit/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Credit","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/investment-management/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Investment Management","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/leveraged-investing/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Leveraged Investing","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/loan/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Loan","type":"tags"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law IV: Making Money with Other People\u0026rsquo;s Money # By applying the principle of financial leverage, an investment of 500 million can double your business.\nUtilizing Leveraged Investing # The path to wealth through investment relies on \u0026ldquo;making money with money.\u0026rdquo; Therefore, the prerequisite for investment is having capital. A common dilemma faced by individuals when investing is, \u0026ldquo;What if I don\u0026rsquo;t have enough money?\u0026rdquo; This can lead to missed opportunities. This book proposes a solution: \u0026ldquo;If you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough money, but someone else does and is willing to lend it to you, then borrow it.\u0026rdquo; This is the highest realm of investment management‚Äîleveraged investing.\nChen Youhao, President of the Tuntex Group: The Money-Making Method of Borrowing and Rolling\nStarting in the textile industry, Chen Youhao used financial leverage to rapidly expand the Tuntex Group into chemical fibers, construction, cement, hotels, petrochemicals, and other fields. With over 30 affiliated companies, it became one of the top 15 largest corporate groups in Taiwan. He also planned to invest nearly 7 billion USD in Taiwan and Thailand to expand chemical fiber plants.\nTuntex\u0026rsquo;s growth never stopped, and its debt continued to rise. In 1995, Tuntex Group\u0026rsquo;s core business, Tonwin Construction, had total assets of 59.6 billion TWD, revenue of 15.7 billion TWD, and net profit after tax of 2.6 billion TWD, but its debt ratio was still as high as 60.99%.\nA graduate of the Department of Economics at National Taiwan University, Chen Youhao always prided himself on his sophisticated money-making method of borrowing and rolling. He had full confidence in Tuntex\u0026rsquo;s financial management. His financial principles were: 1/3 self-owned capital, the rest borrowed from financial institutions; current assets must be greater than current liabilities, with a current ratio greater than 100%; and the ratio of self-owned capital to debt must not exceed 1/2.\nChen Youhao emphasized that whenever the company\u0026rsquo;s debt ratio approached its limit, he would strictly control it, so the company\u0026rsquo;s financial situation remained normal. However, whenever the construction industry was in a downturn, Tuntex would be plagued by rumors of financial difficulties. In June 1995, due to capital needs, Chen Youhao pledged 46.5 million shares of Tonwin, setting a record for the highest number of shares pledged by directors and supervisors that month. Chen Youhao repeatedly assured the public that Tuntex\u0026rsquo;s finances were absolutely sound.\nDespite the rumors damaging the company\u0026rsquo;s image, Chen Youhao firmly believed that reasonable borrowing could enable the company to earn more profits. He was also confident that businesses funded by loans would be profitable because the return on investment was higher than the interest rate on loans.\nIs Borrowing to Invest Wrong?\nIs borrowing money for investment appropriate? Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet, \u0026ldquo;Neither a borrower nor a lender be.\u0026rdquo; This was once considered a golden rule. Our elders often warned their children not to borrow money from others or lend money to others; borrowing was not considered respectable and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.\nIndeed, most stories of financial ruin are caused by debt, such as the cases of Tsai Chen-chou of the Tenth Credit Cooperative and the stock market tycoon Lei Borong. Countless examples of bankruptcy caused by debt make people fear and avoid it.\nHowever, among the famous wealthy individuals we know, such as Wang Yongqing, Kao Ching-yuan, Chang Yung-fa, and Wu Ho-Su, who didn\u0026rsquo;t rely on borrowing to invest in their journey from rags to riches? The answer is \u0026ldquo;none.\u0026rdquo; Moreover, the more successful people are at making money, the more they tend to borrow. Looking at the financial statements of listed companies, are there any renowned high-performing enterprises in Taiwan, such as Formosa Plastics, Uni-President, and Evergreen, that have zero debt? The message is clear: successful tycoons, like successful businesses, rarely achieve their wealth without using other people\u0026rsquo;s money. In business management, appropriate borrowing is not only necessary but also reasonable.\nIf Shakespeare were alive in the 21st century and understood how capitalism works and how people become wealthy, he might change his words to: \u0026ldquo;If you have no money, but others do and are willing to lend it to you, then borrow.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter reviewing these characteristics of success, reflect on your own financial situation. What percentage of your investment funds comes from borrowing? If, like most people, 100% of your investments are made with your own funds, you are overlooking an important tool for building wealth: borrowing.\nBorrowing is a Crucial Tool for Wealth Creation\nAmerican investment consultant Robert Allen repeatedly emphasizes in his bestselling book Creating Wealth: \u0026ldquo;You cannot become rich by investing without borrowing.\u0026rdquo; I disagree with this argument. The examples in Chapter 1 of this book clearly demonstrate that with proper financial management, one can become a billionaire without relying on borrowed investments. The American investment master Warren Buffett does not advocate leveraged investing. Without debt, he is a prime example of building wealth solely through his own funds. However, there is a prerequisite for accumulating wealth using only your own funds: long-term patient waiting. Warren Buffett only rose to prominence after three to four decades of investing.\nAlthough Robert Allen\u0026rsquo;s argument that \u0026ldquo;you cannot become rich without borrowing\u0026rdquo; is incorrect, I must admit that the \u0026ldquo;leveraged investing\u0026rdquo; he advocates is an important means of building wealth, especially for those who want to accelerate the speed of wealth creation. Leveraged investing is a tool that should not be ignored.\nIn conclusion, whether you want to accelerate wealth accumulation or can tolerate the pressure of leveraged investing, you must understand the nature and impact of leveraged investing before deciding if this tool is right for you.\nLeveraged investing is a powerful tool, but it must be used wisely. It is possible to build wealth without borrowing. Leveraged investing, when used correctly, can accelerate wealth accumulation. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of leveraged investing, but be very careful. Aim high with your business goals, Once decided, go for it and never back down. The key to success in business lies in courage and strategy.\nWeng Damming\u0026rsquo;s Revival of the Family Business # In Taiwan, there are quite a few entrepreneurs skilled in financial leverage. Besides Chen Youhao, the president of the Tuntex Group, Weng Damming, the head of the Hualon Group, is also a master of this art.\nWeng Damming, the head of the Hualon Group, became a highly controversial figure due to his unconventional style. After the death of his father, Weng Mingchang, Weng Damming shouldered the heavy responsibility of reviving the family business. Starting in textiles, the Hualon Group owned Hualon Textile, Hualon Microelectronics, Yixin Trading, Jiashin Livestock, and Kuo Hua Life Insurance, among other affiliated companies.\nWeng Damming adopted a high-leverage approach to business management. In 1994, the Hualon Group had total assets of 130 billion TWD and debts as high as over 50 billion TWD, of which over 30 billion TWD were short-term debts. He used the stocks or real estate of affiliated companies as collateral for bank loans, with a pledge ratio of nearly 60%. Therefore, during the stock market crash and the real estate downturn, Weng Damming was troubled by rumors of financial difficulties. Due to the sluggish stock and real estate markets, the collateral value of the Hualon Group was insufficient, requiring him to supplement the collateral or face the pressure of being \u0026ldquo;liquidated.\u0026rdquo; However, the seasoned Weng Damming, with his flexible financial management, once again demonstrated that the financial crisis was just a false alarm.\nAs Hualon Textile, the parent company of the Hualon Group, enjoyed stable profits and increased earnings with the gradual recovery of the textile industry, Weng Damming was able to borrow money fearlessly and aggressively expand into new businesses. With a gambler\u0026rsquo;s mentality, Weng Damming can be said to have maximized the principle of financial leverage. The story of this legendary figure shows us both the rewards and risks of leveraged investing.\nThe Principle of Financial Leverage\nAct within your means; don\u0026rsquo;t over-leverage, or you risk being shaken out. In finance, borrowing is known as \u0026ldquo;financial leverage.\u0026rdquo; Simply put, leverage is the principle of using a small force to achieve a large effect. Humans discovered the power of leverage early on and used it to move or lift heavy objects. The ancients used the principle of leverage to create magnificent engineering marvels such as the Great Wall and the pyramids. Modern wealthy individuals use the principle of financial leverage to create immense fortunes. Archimedes once said, \u0026ldquo;Give me a place to stand, and I shall move the earth.\u0026rdquo; In investment management, financial leverage implies: \u0026ldquo;Lend me enough money, and I can make any large investment.\u0026rdquo;\nLeveraged investing involves borrowing other people\u0026rsquo;s money to make larger investments, thus utilizing the leverage effect. Proper use of leverage can turn small amounts of money into large profits. Conversely, improper use can also lead to significant losses with small amounts of money. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example to help readers understand how financial leverage works. Suppose you buy a house with 10 million in cash. A year later, you are fortunate enough to sell it for 13 million, making a 30% profit (R1). If you only paid 3 million in cash for the house and borrowed the remaining 7 million from the bank at a 10% interest rate, and then sold it for 13 million a year later, your profit margin would increase to 77% (R2). Conversely, if the house price unfortunately drops by 30% after a year, and you sell it for 7 million, the person who bought it entirely in cash would lose 30% (R3). The investor who borrowed 7 million would see their loss expand to 123% (R4), meaning not only is the original investment lost, but they are also in debt. The calculation of the above rates of return is as follows:\nR1=(1300‚àí1000)/1000=30%R2=(1300‚àí1000‚àí700√ó10%)/300=77%R3=(700‚àí1000)/1000=‚àí30%R4=(700‚àí1000‚àí700√ó10%)/300=‚àí123%(Calculations in units of 10,000)\nFrom the above example, we can clearly see how debt leverage exerts the power of \u0026ldquo;using a small force to achieve a large effect.\u0026rdquo; When the return on investment is higher than the interest rate on the loan, leveraged investing will increase the return on investment. When the return on investment is lower than the interest rate on the loan, the return on investment will decrease due to the borrowing.\nThe main reason for the leverage effect is that loan interest is a cost that must be paid under any circumstances. Regardless of the investment return, the interest cost of borrowing remains fixed. Therefore, when the investment return is greater than the loan cost, the excess profit belongs to the borrower, creating a positive leverage effect and naturally increasing the return on investment of the principal. However, when the investment return is less than the loan interest cost, the borrower must bear the difference, resulting in a negative leverage effect, which reduces the return on the principal. This is especially true when the investment incurs a loss, as the borrowing cost will magnify the loss.\nFinancial leverage is like a seesaw, It can lift you very high, It can also cause you to fall hard.\nTwo Major Principles of Borrowing # Financial leverage is like a seesaw: it can lift you very high or cause you to fall hard, depending on whether the leverage effect is positive or negative. The key factor determining the direction of the leverage effect is which is higher: the return on investment or the interest rate on the loan. If the return on investment is greater than the interest rate, the leverage effect is positive. Conversely, if the return on investment is lower than the interest rate, the leverage effect becomes detrimental.\nReturn on Investment Must Be Higher Than the Interest Rate\nTherefore, when deciding whether to use leveraged investing, the first things to consider are: What is the purpose of the loan? What is the expected return on investment for the target investment? Is it higher than the loan interest rate? If the return on investment of the targeted investment is significantly lower than the borrowing rate, the idea of leveraged investing should be dismissed early on. Otherwise, the result will certainly be detrimental rather than beneficial. If you can\u0026rsquo;t understand what the expected return on investment is or whether the return is higher than the interest rate, then I advise you to understand these issues before borrowing!\nDebt is synonymous with risk. Increasing debt increases risk and the possibility of personal or family bankruptcy. There are two major principles of leveraged investing:\nThe expected return on investment must be greater than the interest rate on the loan. For example, if the loan interest rate is 11%, it\u0026rsquo;s only worthwhile if the after-tax return on investment is above 11%. In the worst-case scenario, your cash income must be sufficient to cover the principal and interest payments. For instance, if the investment price falls instead of rises after a few years, you must have enough cash income to repay the principal and interest on time. Furthermore, investors must keep in mind that leveraged investing should not be based on the expectation that the price of the investment target will definitely rise, but rather on the preparation for a price drop. Therefore, you should only engage in leveraged investing if you can still afford the interest payments even if the price continues to fall. You must also be able to withstand the psychological pressure that comes with leveraged investing.\nAvoiding Improper Borrowing\nSome readers may feel smug after reading this section because they are already engaged in what they consider leveraged investing. Upon further inquiry, however, it turns out they are borrowing money to buy lottery tickets, futures, or other speculative products, or even taking out loans to purchase consumer goods. I must emphasize that these actions do not constitute proper \u0026ldquo;leveraged investing.\u0026rdquo;\nFutures markets, margin trading (such as foreign exchange and bonds), or any gambling activities like lotteries and horse racing all have negative expected returns. Long-term participation will inevitably lead to financial ruin. Coupled with the deadly effect of borrowing, the result will undoubtedly be rapid bankruptcy. Therefore, no matter how alluring these games are, remember: It\u0026rsquo;s okay to indulge occasionally for recreational purposes, but never borrow money to participate, or you will accelerate your path to bankruptcy with dire consequences.\nAnother point to remind readers of is to avoid borrowing money to purchase consumer goods. Borrowing to consume is like using future money to create \u0026ldquo;false wealth.\u0026rdquo; Unless absolutely necessary, the concept of borrowing for consumption should be avoided. Otherwise, the family\u0026rsquo;s financial situation will be burdened.\nFor banks, consumer loans are extremely risky and require high interest rates. Generally, consumer loan interest rates are above 10%. Readers should understand that high-return investments have an amazing compounding effect. Similarly, high-interest loans also have a dramatic compounding effect. Take car loans, for example. Assuming a 20% loan interest rate, after three and a half years, you will have to repay double the amount. This means that if you borrow money to buy a car now, three and a half years later, not only will the original car have depreciated significantly, but you will effectively have to pay for two new cars of the same model. My advice on car loans is: don\u0026rsquo;t take them. Wait until you can afford to pay in cash. Car loan interest rates are usually very high, often exceeding 15%, although there are occasional promotional periods with lower rates. Fundamentally, except for commercial vehicles, cars are consumer goods with no investment return. From an investment perspective, borrowing for car purchases is highly inadvisable.\nUncontrolled Consumer Lending Easily Leads to Bankruptcy\nCredit cards, now a ubiquitous form of plastic currency worldwide, are also a typical example of consumer loans. Since the popularization of credit cards, consumer behavior has undergone significant changes. While credit cards offer great convenience, their widespread use has led to a surge in bankruptcy cases among American families, with outstanding credit card debt exceeding 700 billion USD. Some may wonder: how can credit cards lead to bankruptcy if you only spend what you have? In fact, from a borrowing perspective, credit cards have an irresistible allure.\nThe greatest temptation of credit card borrowing lies in its simplicity. With just a signature, you can make purchases in advance and even borrow cash from the bank, subtly inflating your spending power. Remember: when using credit cards, never spend more than you can afford to repay each month. Credit card interest rates are often above 20%, so you should always pay off your credit card balance promptly. My advice is: \u0026ldquo;If you can\u0026rsquo;t control your spending urges, it\u0026rsquo;s best not to apply for a credit card. If you apply for one for convenience, never use it for the sake of credit. Use it only when it truly offers convenience.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile using credit cards for borrowing is convenient, those who entertain this idea should first understand the destructive power of a 20% interest rate. As mentioned earlier, if you save 14,000 per year and invest it in an investment tool with a 20% annual return, after 40 years, the 560,000 invested will grow to 102.81 million due to the power of compounding. Similarly, if someone borrows 14,000 per year on a credit card for 40 years, totaling 560,000, with a 20% interest rate, they will have to repay the bank 102.81 million after 40 years. This explains why the prevalence of credit card debt in the United States has historically led to numerous bankruptcies.\nAnother common type of loan is a mortgage. Generally, mortgages are a sound form of leveraged investing because, in the long run, the average return on real estate is above 20%, while typical mortgage interest rates are around 10%, which meets the first principle of leveraged investing: the expected return on investment is higher than the interest rate on the loan. Whether it meets the second principle depends on the purchase conditions. In recent years, with the real estate market downturn and oversupply, some pre-sale housing promotions offer \u0026ldquo;70% financing,\u0026rdquo; allowing you to own a 10 million house with only a 3 million down payment. This is quite appealing, but investors often overlook the fact that while borrowing 7 million sounds great, they must be able to afford the monthly principal and interest payments of over 70,000. Without considering this, there is a risk of foreclosure and being forced to sell at a low price within months of purchase, suffering losses before enjoying any benefits of leveraged investing. Therefore, when purchasing real estate with borrowed funds, careful calculations must be made beforehand to choose a suitable house price that does not jeopardize the family\u0026rsquo;s normal living expenses.\nAlthough the initial burden of a mortgage is heavy, it becomes lighter over time as work experience and salary increase. If you wait until you have saved enough money to buy a house, you might miss the opportunity entirely due to the rapid appreciation of house prices. Therefore, young people without real estate should consider buying a house as an investment. It not only forces them to save but also effectively combats inflation. Moreover, they can utilize the principle of financial leverage, using the bank\u0026rsquo;s money to expand their credit and accumulate wealth.\nHow Much Debt Should You Take On?\nIf you decide to use leveraged investing, the next question is: how much debt should you take on? This is a crucial question. Too much debt carries high risks, while too little debt fails to fully utilize the potential of making money with other people\u0026rsquo;s money.\nHow much debt should a family take on? Like \u0026ldquo;how much debt should a company have,\u0026rdquo; this is a question without a precise answer. In practice, it depends on the specific circumstances of each family. However, one thing is certain: if a family has the capacity to borrow but chooses not to, it is being too conservative and not managing its finances optimally. Conversely, excessive borrowing is too dangerous. Before taking on debt, each family should consider its actual situation and make a wise judgment about its debt level. As for how much to borrow, I recommend considering the following factors:\nIncome Stability: Loan interest must be paid on time regardless of investment performance. If your income source is unstable, you may not be able to make regular interest payments, making high-leverage investments unsuitable. Similar to companies with stable income, they have a greater capacity to utilize more debt. Personal Assets: Borrowing from financial institutions requires tangible assets as collateral. Therefore, owning more assets suitable as collateral allows for larger leveraged investments. Return on Investment: Other things being equal, the higher the return on investment, the greater the benefits of financial leverage. Inflation Rate: Borrowing is more advantageous during periods of high inflation, as inflation allows you to repay debt with less valuable money. Risk Tolerance: Everyone has a different risk tolerance, related to personality and individual circumstances. Those with low risk tolerance should not over-leverage, even if it could lead to large profits, as the stress could take a toll. Market Interest Rate Levels: Generally, when market interest rates fall and bank funds are ample, not only is it easier for investors to borrow money, but the benefits of financial leverage are also greater. Therefore, falling interest rates present an opportune time for investors to consider leveraged investing. Keeping money in the bank makes a person poor.\nThe Bank is Not a Place for Saving Money # What is the function of a bank to you? Many people believe banks are for saving money. However, for those who truly understand investment management, banks are not a place to save money, but a source of borrowing.\nThe function of a bank is to provide a place for those who are not good at managing money to save, so that those who are good at it can use that money to invest and make profits. Suppose someone deposits 14,000 per year into a bank at a 5% interest rate. After 40 years, the bank will owe this depositor 1.69 million. On the other hand, if an investor borrows 14,000 per year from the same bank at the same 5% interest rate and invests that money in stocks or real estate, achieving an average annual return of 20%, after 40 years, their investment would grow to 102.81 million, while they only need to repay the bank 1.69 million. In other words, the 101.12 million gained was made by utilizing the money of bank depositors.\nHow to Build Credit\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s highly developed financial markets, there are numerous financing channels for businesses. However, for individuals, banks remain the primary source of borrowing. Maintaining a close relationship with the bank and earning their trust is crucial for building personal credit.\nCredit is the ability to borrow. A person with high credit not only demonstrates a strong ability to repay loans but also indicates wealth. How do you build credit? As the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;Loan and repay, and borrowing again is easy.\u0026rdquo; The first rule of building credit is to borrow money and repay it on time. Some people, to establish their creditworthiness (the ability to borrow), even borrow small sums of money for seemingly frivolous reasons, just to build a good borrowing record so they can borrow larger amounts in the future.\nDiscard the outdated notion that \u0026ldquo;borrowing is not respectable.\u0026rdquo; In the past, only those in dire financial straits would borrow money. Nowadays, such individuals can at most borrow small amounts from relatives and friends. They would likely be unable to borrow a cent from a bank. Today, those who can borrow from banks are typically wealthy individuals.\nBased on current bank loan approval standards, without sufficient assets as collateral or evidence of stable future income and repayment ability, can anyone borrow money? Therefore, when I hear about someone heavily in debt, my first question is whether the source of the debt is banks or private loans. If the source is entirely from banks, my immediate thought is: \u0026ldquo;This person must be wealthy.\u0026rdquo;\nBorrowing: A Double-Edged Sword\nThose who don\u0026rsquo;t borrow cannot go bankrupt; similarly, those who don\u0026rsquo;t borrow can hardly become immensely wealthy in a short period. \u0026ldquo;Debt\u0026rdquo; appears in the lives of both the most successful and the most unsuccessful. While many wealthy individuals utilize debt to become rich, many poor people are ruined by misusing debt. Borrowing is a double-edged sword. Used correctly, it is a significant aid to investment and wealth creation. Used improperly, its destructive power can lead to complete ruin. Prudence is essential when using it. It\u0026rsquo;s like a double-edged sword that can save or harm, depending on how it\u0026rsquo;s wielded.\nI advise against rushing into leveraged investing before fully understanding its principles. First, understand the nature of leveraged investing and carefully consider whether to use borrowing for investment. Before borrowing, thoroughly understand how leveraged investing works. Only then can you truly achieve the goal of making money with other people\u0026rsquo;s money without harming yourself.\n","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005963/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law IV","type":"posts"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law V: Mitigating Investment Risk # Investment and financial management should never prioritize returns while neglecting risks.\nAnalyzing Risk, Minimizing Damage # In 1987, while working at Merrill Lynch in the United States, I met a seasoned investment veteran with decades of Wall Street experience. He once said, \u0026ldquo;I can teach you how to pick stocks in an hour, but it would take me more than five years to teach you how to manage investment risk.\u0026rdquo;\nRisk is Unavoidable\nIn the ever-changing and unpredictable world of investment, uncertainties abound. We call these uncertainties risks. How you face these risks when they materialize is a question every investor must confront. Risk is called risk precisely because future outcomes are uncertain and unavoidable. Therefore, investment and financial management should never solely focus on returns while ignoring risks. In fact, managing risk is even more crucial. The purpose of risk management is not to eliminate risk entirely, but to acknowledge its inherent existence and impossibility of complete eradication. It\u0026rsquo;s about analyzing risk and subsequently mitigating it.\nWhile engaging in risk management, investors must understand that \u0026ldquo;you can never be fully prepared for every risk.\u0026rdquo; You can strive to reduce risk, but don\u0026rsquo;t attempt to eliminate it completely. Many try to avoid risk through predictions or expert advice. However, no matter how accurate your forecasting techniques or how insightful the expert predictions, risk can never be fully avoided. The greatest danger of predictions is not their frequent inaccuracy, but the tendency for investors to blindly trust them, losing their risk awareness. They focus solely on whether the prediction comes true, neglecting the potential magnitude of the underlying risks. Relying solely on predictions without thorough risk analysis is extremely dangerous. Any sound investment decision inherently involves unknowns, uncertainties, and risks. Furthermore, investments without uncertainties and a degree of risk are unlikely to be good investments.\nAll High-Return Investments Carry High Risks\nThe key to successful investment and financial management lies in learning to grasp high returns while effectively managing the accompanying risks.\nThe investment environment is constantly changing and unpredictable. The only constant is change. Some external factors (such as interest rates, exchange rates, economic conditions, and inflation rates) are bound to change, although the nature of these changes remains unknown. Additionally, unforeseen events (such as wars, political events, and natural disasters) are uncontrollable variables. To succeed in this volatile investment world, the most important thing is not to lament change but to accept it as inevitable. Prepare for various changes and even anticipate them, because only through change can wealth be redistributed. Change is both a threat and an opportunity, depending on how you respond. Skilled investors often find profitable opportunities amidst change.\nPeople often assume investors love risk. This is not true. Successful investors possess a unique ability to manage risk. They don\u0026rsquo;t see \u0026ldquo;risk-taking\u0026rdquo; as a source of amusement, nor do they find the act of taking risks thrilling or exciting. They take risks solely for the potential of high investment returns. Since all high-return investments inherently carry high risks, risk-taking is an unavoidable part of the journey to financial success.\nMany perceive stock investment as extremely risky, believing stock investors to be risk-seekers. In reality, investing in stocks is not about loving the risk associated with stocks. It\u0026rsquo;s about understanding that all high-return investments carry high risks. To build wealth, you must take the risk of investing in high-return assets and bear the associated risks. Savvy investors understand how to take calculated risks and mitigate them. In fact, if risk mitigation measures are implemented effectively, the actual risks of investment and financial management are relatively small.\nStocks and real estate offer high returns precisely because of their inherent volatility and risk. Because most people are risk-averse and avoid investing in risky assets like stocks and real estate, those who can tolerate risk are better positioned to reap higher returns.\nMany shy away from stocks and real estate primarily because they fear losses, are intimidated by future uncertainties, or can\u0026rsquo;t handle price fluctuations. In fact, short-term price fluctuations are perfectly normal and highlight the high-risk nature of high-return investments. Therefore, to achieve high returns, one must possess a spirit of adventure and be able to withstand significant volatility.\n1. Unpredictable risks allow risk-takers to earn a risk premium.\n2. We miss opportunities because we are afraid to take risks, not because the world doesn\u0026rsquo;t offer them.\n3. To achieve financial success through investment, you must take risks, because high returns always come with high risks.\nI dislike taking unnecessary risks, so before every activity, I do my best to take necessary precautions to mitigate risk.\nThe Forbes Philosophy on Risk # Malcolm Forbes was a legendary figure in the American business world. He amassed a fortune by founding Forbes magazine, possessed a priceless collection, and was listed among the 400 wealthiest Americans. He not only ran a high-risk magazine business but was also a renowned hot air balloonist and motorcycle enthusiast. He once rode a motorcycle across Eurasia from Paris to Beijing. He traveled the world, flying hot air balloons across the United States, and even ventured to Turkey and China, setting multiple world records and attracting widespread media attention, making him a household name.\nAverting Danger Before it Happens, Ensuring Safety\nSome labeled him an \u0026ldquo;adventurer.\u0026rdquo; He offered an insightful explanation of this label, saying, \u0026ldquo;Many people think I\u0026rsquo;m a risk-lover. I\u0026rsquo;m not. Like most people, I strongly dislike risk. The reason I take risks today, despite my aversion to them, is simple: all good things in life come with risks. I take risks purely to live a rich and fulfilling life.‚Äù \u0026ldquo;Riding in a hot air balloon or on a motorcycle across different lands broadens one\u0026rsquo;s horizons and exposes one to the world\u0026rsquo;s beauty, enriching life. However, many people, despite yearning for these experiences, hesitate to engage in them because they perceive them as high-risk activities. But, once you actually try them, you\u0026rsquo;ll find that if you take adequate precautions beforehand, the risks involved are quite small.‚Äù \u0026ldquo;I dislike taking unnecessary risks, so before every activity, I strive to take the necessary preventative measures to mitigate risk.\u0026rdquo;\nMalcolm Forbes was risk-averse, but he took risks to experience the good things in life, and after taking those risks, he sought ways to mitigate them.\nAssess the Rewards and Risks, If It\u0026rsquo;s Worth It ‚Äì Take the Risk\nAre you afraid of taking risks? If so, you are not alone. Most people are afraid of taking risks; very few are natural risk-takers. But why are some people so composed in the face of risk, and even achieve success through it? It\u0026rsquo;s because they understand the principles of \u0026ldquo;nothing ventured, nothing gained\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;no high risk, no high return.\u0026rdquo; Indeed, the correct perspective on risk should be: take risks worth taking, and then find ways to mitigate them.\nSuccessful investors are driven by the pursuit of \u0026ldquo;wealth.\u0026rdquo; Although they must be prepared to withstand the pressure of price fluctuations, as long as the expected return is high and there\u0026rsquo;s a risk premium, risk-taking will ultimately lead to success.\nBefore every investment, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to understand the potential risks and develop contingency plans for every possible scenario. Analyze the degree of blind risk-taking, estimate the probability of success, and continuously re-evaluate throughout the process. I recommend investors create a risk-reward assessment table before making any investment, weighing all factors. Ask yourself, \u0026ldquo;Can I bear the consequences if the worst-case scenario unfolds?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Is the potential return of this investment attractive enough?\u0026rdquo;\nAlways plan for the worst and prepare for the best. This is especially true for investment and financial management. Before making any investment, no matter how confident you are, you should ask yourself, \u0026ldquo;What is the worst possible outcome?\u0026rdquo; Then ask, \u0026ldquo;Can I bear the consequences if the worst happens?\u0026rdquo; If the answer to both questions is yes, and the expected return is high enough, then you should invest. If the worst-case scenario is unbearable, then no matter how alluring the potential reward, you should categorically refuse to invest.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Take Unnecessary Risks\nIf you ever visit Las Vegas or Atlantic City, observe the lavishly decorated casinos carefully. You\u0026rsquo;ll notice the absence of clocks and windows, and the ever-present bright lights. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no time in the mountains, and no time in casinos.\u0026rdquo; Why are there no clocks or windows in casinos? It\u0026rsquo;s because casinos leverage the law of large numbers to win your money. The lack of clocks and windows is designed to blur the lines between day and night, encouraging gamblers to play endlessly until they lose track of time. The longer you play, the more times you play, the higher the probability of the casino winning. As the number of games increases, the expected value gradually reveals itself. Gambling inevitably leads to losses because its expected value is negative. This might not be apparent in a few instances, but over time, the expected value becomes increasingly evident. Therefore, prolonged gambling inevitably leads to losses. This explains the saying \u0026ldquo;nine out of ten gamblers lose\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;long-term gambling leads to certain loss,\u0026rdquo; which aligns perfectly with the principle of the law of large numbers. The law of large numbers states that the more times a game is played, the closer the return gets to the expected value of that game.\nI had a classmate in the doctoral program at UC Berkeley who excelled in mathematics and frequented Las Vegas casinos on weekends. Curious, I asked him, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re so smart and you know that gambling is designed against the players. Are you trying to win money?\u0026rdquo; He replied, \u0026ldquo;I never go there to win money. I gamble to relieve stress.\u0026rdquo; He explained that after a heartbreak in college, he tried various methods to cope, such as drinking, speeding, and traveling, but none were effective. He eventually found that only gambling could allow him to truly escape. Gambling can be a form of entertainment, but it\u0026rsquo;s certainly not a way to make money. Its expected average return is lower than bank deposits, making it impossible to build wealth through such activities.\nMany people hold the misconception that \u0026ldquo;high risk always equates to high return.\u0026rdquo; This misunderstanding stems from a misinterpretation of the definition of \u0026ldquo;return.\u0026rdquo; High risk might indeed offer high potential returns, but this represents the maximum possible return, which has a very low probability. However, in the context of \u0026ldquo;high risk, high return,\u0026rdquo; the \u0026ldquo;return\u0026rdquo; refers to the expected return (long-term average return), not the maximum possible return. Indeed, gambling boasts incredibly high maximum potential returns, but its average, or expected, return is negative. Taking such risks is not only unprofitable but also detrimental.\nThere are No High-Return, Zero-Risk Investments\nSuccess requires risk-taking, but risk-taking doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee success. One must take calculated risks. A calculated risk is one that, on average, offers high returns over the long term.\nSome people\u0026rsquo;s problem isn\u0026rsquo;t a lack of risk-taking spirit but a tendency to take unnecessary risks. They don\u0026rsquo;t know what risks to take to achieve financial success. As detailed in previous chapters, the cornerstone of investment success is the power of compounding, which only works effectively with high returns. Over the long term, stocks and real estate are asset classes that offer high expected returns. Therefore, taking calculated risks means investing in assets with high expected returns and bravely bearing the associated risks.\nConsider a game where participants must pay $100. There\u0026rsquo;s a 99.9% chance of losing $100 and a 0.1% chance of winning $95,000. Would you play? In a survey I conducted with hundreds of students, over 65% chose to play this high-risk game. Their reasoning was simple: while the risk was high, the potential loss was capped at $100, while the potential gain was a whopping $95,000. However, the expected return of this game is negative. Even if you get lucky and win once, in the long run, you\u0026rsquo;re bound to lose. This is a classic example of a risk not worth taking.\nAvoid risks that don\u0026rsquo;t offer high returns. Activities like futures trading, margin trading in foreign exchange and bonds, lotteries, and short-term stock trading all carry high risks and often have negative returns. In other words, these are high-risk, negative-return activities. You can engage in these activities for entertainment, but never delude yourself into believing they will bring you wealth.\nThere are no high-return, zero-risk investment opportunities. In a society filled with intelligent individuals, such opportunities are impossible. If someone offers you a high-return, risk-free investment opportunity, they are undoubtedly trying to scam you.\nI remind readers again: don\u0026rsquo;t blindly chase high returns and jump into risky ventures. Speculative activities like those mentioned above are not truly high-return investment tools, but they are definitely high-risk endeavors. These risks are not worth taking.\nAbsolute safety is a myth. The real danger is not taking any risks. In a volatile environment, the biggest risk is not taking any risks.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Shy Away from Risk Entirely # The future world is changing rapidly. Changes will accelerate across all aspects of business, economics, finance, politics, and society, creating a more complex financial landscape. It\u0026rsquo;s foreseeable that wealth redistribution will also accelerate. Risk aversion is human nature. In the past, you could live a stable life without taking risks. However, in the face of the volatile investment environment of the future, not taking risks becomes the biggest risk of all.\nFear of Falling Will Keep You from Running Fast\nFear of risk prevents many from investing, causing them to miss out on the opportunity to build wealth. Keeping money in a bank seems safe and risk-free. However, as previously analyzed, inflation severely erodes the real value of money. From a financial management perspective, keeping money in a bank carries the greatest risk. Decades later, when those around you who invested wisely become millionaires, those who kept their money in banks may face financial hardship. My point is: don\u0026rsquo;t shy away from risk entirely. Risk isn\u0026rsquo;t as terrifying as it seems. Taking calculated risks with high potential returns is absolutely worthwhile.\nI\u0026rsquo;m often asked, \u0026ldquo;Teacher, will the stock market fall again?\u0026rdquo; My answer is, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; Then they ask, \u0026ldquo;When will it start rising?\u0026rdquo; My answer remains, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; They further inquire, \u0026ldquo;Which stock should I buy? Can you give me a hot tip?\u0026rdquo; My answer is still, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; Then they question skeptically, \u0026ldquo;How can you invest when you don\u0026rsquo;t know anything? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that too risky?\u0026rdquo; My response is, \u0026ldquo;You must invest and manage your finances without knowing the answers to these questions to succeed.\u0026rdquo;\nWhy invest when the answers are unknown and the future is uncertain? The reason is simple: While the future is full of risks, one thing is certain: as long as the economy continues to grow and corporate profitability rises, the long-term return on investment in the stock market will inevitably surpass bank deposits, and by a significant margin. Repeatedly avoiding worthwhile risks will prevent you from building wealth.\nHow to Cultivate a Risk-Taking Spirit\nA courageous risk-taker is not someone without fear, but someone with the power to overcome it.\nThe spirit of adventure isn\u0026rsquo;t innate; it\u0026rsquo;s developed through practice, through taking risks, failing, taking risks again, failing again‚Ä¶ step by step.\nEveryone is capable of taking risks, and everyone has had the experience of taking bold risks. As toddlers, we dared to stand and learn to walk, falling and getting back up countless times. Learning to ride a bicycle involved numerous falls, followed by getting back up, falling again, and getting back up again, until we finally mastered it. Most life skills, such as swimming, skating, driving, public speaking, and so on, are not innate instincts. Learning these skills requires going through a phase of risk-taking, embracing the spirit of perseverance, and trying repeatedly. Learning investment and financial management is no exception; it requires this standard process of risk-taking. To become a successful investor, you must first discard the habit of risk aversion, rediscover your lost instinct for adventure, and cultivate a healthy risk-taking spirit.\nDoes investing have to be extremely risky? In reality, the risks involved in investment and financial management are no greater than the examples mentioned above. It\u0026rsquo;s just that as we reach an age where we believe we are qualified to manage finances, our risk-taking spirit has diminished significantly. As children, almost everyone learns to walk. A little older, most learn to ride a bicycle. But as we grow older, the number of people who learn more adventurous activities like swimming and skating decreases considerably. In adulthood, the number of people comfortable with public speaking dwindles even further.\nOur risk-taking spirit seems to fade with age. This is partly because experiencing failures and mistakes naturally leads to frustration and discouragement. Without sufficient motivation, we tend to avoid taking risks to minimize the blow of failure. Another contributing factor is traditional education. Out of a desire to protect children, adults often reprimand them for any risky behavior, instilling a habit of prioritizing safety and avoiding mistakes. Children then strive to be \u0026ldquo;good kids\u0026rdquo; who never do anything wrong. As we age, this risk aversion becomes ingrained. While avoiding risk isn\u0026rsquo;t inherently bad, excessive risk aversion becomes a significant obstacle to successful investment and financial management.\nThe First Priority of Financial Management: Overcoming Fear\nWhen individuals can control their fear, they can control their thoughts and actions. Self-control enables them to remain calm in chaotic environments, make necessary decisions without being paralyzed by the uncertainty of the outcomes, and be prepared to bear the consequences of failure when things don\u0026rsquo;t go as planned. This courage and risk-taking spirit in the face of danger are essential qualities for investors.\nCourageous risk-takers are not fearless; they simply recognize risk and overcome their fear of it. Courage stems from controlling fear, and cultivating a risk-taking spirit begins with understanding risk.\nTo become a successful investor, you must first discard the habit of avoiding risk. Admittedly, changing long-held risk-averse habits is no easy feat. However, since risk-taking is an indispensable element of successful financial management, the first priority in learning to manage your finances is to overcome fear and force yourself to take risks. Cultivate a healthy risk-taking spirit, invest bravely in assets with high expected returns, and bear the associated risks.\nTop performers in any field achieve success by bravely facing their fears and taking calculated risks. Those who achieve financial success and fulfill their dreams through investment share this same spirit of adventure. Remember: excessive caution hinders success. Without a spirit of adventure, dreams will forever remain dreams.\nMastering risk is the foundation of successful financial management.\nOvercoming Risk ‚Äì Start Small # Skilled risk-takers never test the depth of the water by stepping in with both feet. They extend one foot first, and if the situation seems unfavorable, they quickly withdraw. An African proverb states, \u0026ldquo;Only a fool tests the depth of the water with both feet.\u0026rdquo; Similarly, only a fool would go all-in without any investment experience.\nGain Experience with Small Amounts of Money\nWhen faced with unfamiliar investment opportunities, don\u0026rsquo;t put all your eggs in one basket. Start small. Skilled generals don\u0026rsquo;t expose their main forces to unnecessary danger. To gather intelligence and gain an advantage, they deploy small reconnaissance units deep into enemy territory to identify low-risk, high-impact attack strategies.\nThe same principle applies to investment risk-taking strategies. When dealing with unfamiliar investments, unclear situations, or a lack of confidence, avoid going all-in. Start small, using small amounts of money to gain experience and familiarize yourself with the situation. Once you have sufficient experience and confidence, then you can invest larger sums.\nAs the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;All things are difficult before they are easy.\u0026rdquo; The best way to overcome fear is to confront what you fear head-on. Since risk-taking is an essential part of building wealth through investment, don\u0026rsquo;t shy away from it. Start with small investments to build your risk tolerance. With experience, the feeling of fear will gradually dissipate. By progressively overcoming small fears, you can then face larger risks. You\u0026rsquo;ll soon discover that the experience gained through risk-taking is helping you steadily approach your dreams.\nOnce You\u0026rsquo;re Used to Risk, You\u0026rsquo;ll Find It\u0026rsquo;s Not So Scary\nRisk aversion is human nature, but don\u0026rsquo;t let a single investment failure shatter your confidence and prevent you from investing again, turning you into a perpetual loser. Conversely, don\u0026rsquo;t let a stroke of good luck make you forget the existence of risk, leading you to borrow heavily and invest recklessly, resulting in irreparable losses. Successful and unsuccessful investors alike fear risk; they simply react to it differently.\nDear readers, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t tried investing yet, take the plunge for the sake of building wealth! If you take appropriate risk mitigation measures after investing, I can assure you from experience: \u0026ldquo;The risks of investing are actually quite small, even smaller than the risk of riding a bicycle. After 10 or 20 years of investing, when you see your wealth growing rapidly, the feeling will be hundreds of times better than riding a bicycle.\u0026rdquo;\nThe first element of investing is a strong adventurous spirit, seeking to generate substantial risk premiums between risk and safety. No matter what investment you choose, as long as it offers high expected returns, risk is inevitable. Investors should embrace calculated risks and accumulate financial knowledge and experience along the way. Risk naturally decreases with accumulated knowledge, and wealth grows at an increasing pace.\nThis book dedicates significant space to discussing risk because the biggest challenge people face in financial management is their inability to confront risk directly. They don\u0026rsquo;t know how to face or manage risk, and some are even afraid to take any risks. They don\u0026rsquo;t realize that the biggest obstacle to successful investment and financial management is the fear of risk. This mindset is understandable, as most investment and financial management decisions are made amidst uncertainty and change. In short, to achieve financial success through investment, you must be willing to take calculated risks. Currently, many people suffer significant losses due to blind risk-taking and involvement in high-risk speculative activities.\nIf you are unwilling to take risks and prefer a conservative approach, be prepared for a life of mediocrity, as this is unavoidable. Of course, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with a conservative and mediocre life if it brings you happiness. The choice is yours. People usually regret the things they didn\u0026rsquo;t do, not the things they tried. Therefore, my advice is: Take risks, but be cautious and learn how to manage them.\n","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005964/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law V","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/return/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Return","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/risk-premium/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Risk Premium","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/risk-taking/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Risk-Taking","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-10","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E4%BF%A1%E7%94%A8/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"‰ø°Áî®","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-10","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%86%92%E9%99%A9%E7%B2%BE%E7%A5%9E/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÂÜíÈô©Á≤æÁ•û","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-10","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%8A%A5%E9%85%AC/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Êä•ÈÖ¨","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-10","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E8%B4%B7%E6%AC%BE/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Ë¥∑Ê¨æ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-10","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E9%A3%8E%E9%99%A9%E6%BA%A2%E4%BB%B7/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"È£éÈô©Ê∫¢‰ª∑","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/entrepreneurship/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Entrepreneurship","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/financial-concepts/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Financial Concepts","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/patience/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Patience","type":"tags"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law II: Patience is Key to Wealth Accumulation # Working hard is not about making more money,\nbut about maintaining a state of mind\n‚Äî challenge, goals, struggle, and success.\nHow Did Li Ka-shing Accumulate His Wealth? # Li Ka-shing, ranked among the top ten wealthiest Chinese in the world with a fortune of nearly $7 billion, is the chairman of Cheung Kong Holdings and Hutchison Whampoa Limited in Hong Kong. His legendary journey to wealth and his influence in Hong Kong\u0026rsquo;s political and business circles have earned him another nickname ‚Äî \u0026ldquo;Superman Li.\u0026rdquo;\nCapitalizing on the Plunging Property Market\nIn 1939, 12-year-old Li Ka-shing moved to Hong Kong from his hometown of Chao\u0026rsquo;an, Guangdong, with his father. After two years of schooling, Hong Kong fell due to the Pacific War. The following year, his father died of a serious illness, forcing Li Ka-shing, the eldest son, to drop out of school and support his family. After Hong Kong\u0026rsquo;s liberation in 1945, he ended his odd-job career and became a salesman at a plastics factory, working over 16 hours a day. Three years later, at the age of 20, he was promoted to general manager. Two years after that, he used all his savings of HK$7,000 to start his own small plastics factory, \u0026ldquo;Cheung Kong Industries,\u0026rdquo; the predecessor of today\u0026rsquo;s largest conglomerate in Hong Kong, Cheung Kong Holdings.\nHow did Li Ka-shing, without even a primary school diploma, take his first step toward becoming the richest man by producing plastic flowers? In 1958, due to a rent increase by the landlord of his factory, Li Ka-shing bought a piece of land in North Point and built his own factory. In the early 1960s, the plastic flower industry declined, and in 1967, Hong Kong property prices plummeted. Li Ka-shing seized the opportunity to acquire land at low prices. In 1972, the Hong Kong stock market soared, and Cheung Kong Industries went public, taking advantage of the opportunity to raise capital from the public to purchase more land. In the 10 years following the completion of his first factory in 1958, his real estate holdings increased 50-fold. Cheung Kong now holds approximately 1.48 million square meters of floor space. Li Ka-shing has been investing in real estate for over 40 years, and long-term investment has accumulated his enormous wealth.\nHaving strived for 50 years and achieved success in wealth accumulation, Li Ka-shing has unique insights into success. He said: \u0026ldquo;Before the age of 20, 100% of career success comes from hard work; between 20 and 30, when a career has some foundation, 10% of success depends on good luck, and 90% still comes from diligence; after 30, the proportion of opportunity gradually increases; now, luck accounts for about 30% to 40%.\u0026rdquo;\nThe same applies to wealth accumulation. Before 20, all money comes from hard work; between 20 and 30 is the time to work hard to earn and save money; after 30, the importance of investment and financial management gradually increases. By middle age, the money earned is less important, and how to manage money becomes more critical. Li Ka-shing has been fighting for his wealth all his life. To become rich, one must have enough patience.\nThe Power of Compound Interest Takes Time\nMany people who have heard my lectures often ask the same questions: \u0026ldquo;Saving 14,000 yuan a year to become a billionaire is indeed impressive, but according to your method, it takes 40 years, which is really discouraging!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;It takes 40 years to become a billionaire. By then, I might be dead. What\u0026rsquo;s the point of having billions then?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Can you teach some secrets to getting rich quickly?\u0026rdquo;\nEven I feel that 40 years is too long. At the repeated requests of the audience, I did spend some time studying this issue in depth. The result of the research is: Financial management requires a long time, and the effect is not visible in the short term. It is impossible to get rich quickly through financial management.\nIf someone starts now and saves 14,000 yuan at the end of each year, and if the money saved each year can be invested in stocks or real estate with an average annual return of 20%, we know that the wealth will grow to 102.81 million yuan after 40 years. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s ask: How much wealth can he accumulate after 10 years? Most people think that with such a high return, even with a shorter time, after 10 years of compounding, it should be at least 5 million yuan, some even guess 10 million, and the most conservative guess is 1 million. Similarly, this is a surprising answer: 360,000 yuan! The following calculation formula should be familiar to readers, but they will be surprised that the amount is so small.\n14,000√ó(1+0.20)10‚àí10.20=360,00014,000√ó(1+0.20)40‚àí10.20=102,810,000\nWith the same 20% return, 14,000 yuan per year results in 102.81 million yuan after 40 years of financial management, but only 360,000 yuan after 10 years, which is unbelievable! The difference is more than 300 times! Fortunately, this concept is presented to readers in a timely manner. Otherwise, if readers use the methods mentioned in this book, save 14,000 yuan every year, and invest all of it in stocks, thinking that they can become billionaires, they would be shocked to find that after ten years of hard work, with an average annual return of 20%, they have only accumulated 360,000 yuan! They might feel cheated. After struggling for 10 years, they can\u0026rsquo;t even afford a car, let alone become billionaires!\nWhat is 10 years? Ten years is a long time. After 10 years of struggle, there\u0026rsquo;s only a little over 300,000 yuan. How discouraging! This is the frustration one inevitably encounters in the process of accumulating wealth through investment and financial management. Investors must understand that financial management is a \u0026ldquo;marathon\u0026rdquo; rather than a \u0026ldquo;sprint.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s about endurance, not explosive power.\nThe prerequisite for getting rich through investment and financial management is time, and a long time. You must go through a very long waiting period before you can see the results. If the invested capital is small, no results will be seen after 10 years.\nEarning Your Second 10 Million is Easier Than the First 1 Million\nSaving 14,000 yuan at the end of each year with an average investment return of 20%, even after 20 years, the assets will only accumulate to 2.61 million yuan. At this point, one is still far from being a billionaire. It takes 30 years to accumulate 16.55 million yuan, barely reaching the millionaire level. Only after 40 years of continuous struggle can one become a billionaire with 102.81 million yuan.\nAnnual Investment of 14,000 Yuan, Wealth Accumulation (20% Return, Unit/10,000 Yuan)\nYear Accumulated Amount at Year End Amount Increased in the Last Five Years 5 10 10 10 36 26 15 101 65 20 261 160 25 661 400 30 1655 994 35 4128 2473 40 10281 6153 From the table above, we can see: by saving 14,000 yuan annually with a 20% investment return, the wealth increased by 360,000 yuan in the first decade, 2.25 million yuan in the second decade, 13.94 million yuan in the third decade, and 86.26 million yuan in the fourth decade. This is the characteristic of geometric progression, and it is also the principle that people engaged in investment and financial management should understand. Therefore, three important characteristics of investment and financial management can be summarized here:\nMost wealth is created in the later stages. From the above example, we can see that only 41.28 million yuan was accumulated in the first 35 years, while 61.53 million yuan was created in the last 5 years. In terms of amount, your ability to make money through financial management increases over time. From the table above, it can be seen that doing the same thing, the amount of money earned increases, the only thing needed is patience. Earning the second 10 million yuan is often easier than the first 1 million yuan. Wealth accumulation doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen overnight.\nPatience Pays Off # A self-made man who got rich by investing in stocks once told me: \u0026ldquo;Now that I\u0026rsquo;ve made it, a stock price increase can easily bring in millions of yuan. Making money has suddenly become so easy, it\u0026rsquo;s unstoppable. Thinking back to the days when I first entered the stock market 30 years ago, it took a lot of hard work to earn tens of thousands of yuan. I really don\u0026rsquo;t know where the money went back then.\u0026rdquo;\nThis experience is not unfamiliar to many who have struggled to build their fortunes from scratch. Everything is difficult at the beginning. During the initial struggle, money is hard to earn. It takes a lot of effort to earn just tens of thousands of yuan. It\u0026rsquo;s puzzling why money is so hard to earn. Until success is achieved, and money comes rolling in, one wonders why making money has become so easy.\nTime is the Stepping Stone to Wealth Accumulation\nEveryone desires the ability to effortlessly earn their second million or ten million, reaching a state of abundant wealth. The problem is, before earning the second million, you need to have the first million. But how can you earn the first million? If you want to accumulate 1 million through investment and financial management, you need \u0026ldquo;time.\u0026rdquo; You have to go through a long period of hardship. If you can endure the difficult period of earning the first million, you can naturally enjoy the ease of earning the second million.\nFrom the compound interest formula, we can see that time is an indispensable factor for compound interest to take effect. Patient waiting is a prerequisite for investment and financial management. Especially for wealth accumulation through financial management, the required patience is not a few months or years, but at least two or three decades, or even four or five decades.\nThe vast majority of wealthy people accumulate their huge fortunes gradually from small amounts of money over a long period. In the beginning, most people have very little capital, even negligible. However, success is woven from a series of small achievements. Great wealth is the accumulation of small wealth, coupled with the effect of compound interest.\nThe importance of time in investment and financial management is evident. Patience is essential for financial management. The more patient you are in enduring the long waiting period, the greater the power of wealth creation will be. This is the characteristic of \u0026ldquo;compound interest.\u0026rdquo; However, today we live in a \u0026ldquo;fast food\u0026rdquo; culture where everything emphasizes speed and efficiency: fast food restaurants for meals, express delivery for mail, highways for driving, one-hour photo processing, and crash courses for learning. People have become increasingly impatient and short-sighted, lacking patience. In investment and financial management, they are also impatient and lack patience, wanting to see results immediately. It may be more efficient to pursue speed in other matters, but investment and financial management cannot be rushed. Time is a necessary condition for financial management. The more you rush, the less you achieve. Based on my observations, a common mistake among investors is giving up halfway. They get easily discouraged during bear markets and simply sell their stocks and real estate, completely leaving the stock and property markets, not knowing that lack of patience and perseverance makes it difficult to achieve anything.\nTime is an indispensable factor in achieving wealth through financial management. The patience required for wealth accumulation is not a few months or years, but at least two or three decades. Patient waiting allows compound interest to take effect. How can investors achieve a state of abundant and unstoppable wealth? Long-term holding and patient waiting. The Real Estate Investment Experience of Madam Chang Yao-Hung-Ying, Chairperson of Grand Pacific Construction\n\u0026ldquo;Land I bought for hundreds of thousands in the past is now worth hundreds of millions.\u0026rdquo;\nMadam Chang Yao-Hung-Ying, chairperson of Grand Pacific Construction, pointed out: In the 1930s, a mainlander investing in land in Taiwan was often ridiculed. But it was with this small capital and perseverance that Madam Chang Yao-Hung-Ying, who left Shanghai for Taiwan in 1947, when her husband became disillusioned with his business, saw the development potential of Taiwan. She picked up their real estate business skills from Shanghai and started buying land.\nAfter more than 40 years, her long-term investment in real estate finally paid off. Her family\u0026rsquo;s business is growing bigger and bigger, and they now own two listed companies: ASE Technology Holding and Grand Pacific Construction. ASE Technology Holding is now the second largest packaging factory in the world. As for Grand Pacific Construction, it launched the Earl\u0026rsquo;s Court project in Xizhi in 1987, which boosted the real estate market in Xizhi and rapidly accumulated their family\u0026rsquo;s wealth, making them one of the richest families in Taiwan.\nMadam Chang Yao-Hung-Ying has now passed the baton to her son, Jason Chang. Jason Chang, chairman of ASE Technology Holding, seems to have inherited his mother\u0026rsquo;s investment acumen. He\u0026rsquo;s the kind of person who buys land wherever he goes, whether it\u0026rsquo;s in Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China, or the United States. Perhaps in another two or three decades, Jason Chang will also say: \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect that the land I bought for a few million back then would now be worth tens of billions.\u0026rdquo; However, Jason Chang\u0026rsquo;s wealth accumulation speed will be much faster than his mother\u0026rsquo;s because he has already laid a good foundation. All he needs to do is go with the flow, and his wealth will increase geometrically, with money rolling in, unstoppable.\nWithstanding the Test of Time is the True Measure\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not your judgment that makes you a lot of money, but your patience.\nA crucial factor in financial management is time. Without a correct understanding of it, impatience will naturally arise. Impatience leads to taking significant risks, turning potential success into failure.\nWhether it\u0026rsquo;s the accumulation of wealth or experience, it\u0026rsquo;s not something that can be accomplished overnight. It takes time. Fortunately, God is very fair in this regard. Regardless of whether one is born rich or poor, noble or humble, everyone has only 24 hours a day and an average lifespan of about 75 years. Time is the greatest wealth in life, and a person\u0026rsquo;s honor, status, wealth, and happiness all depend on how they use this wealth.\nTo accumulate wealth through investment and financial management, time is an indispensable factor. It cannot be rushed. Investment and financial management can lead to slow and steady wealth accumulation, but investing small amounts of money and wanting to earn billions of wealth in a short period is, I can say with certainty, \u0026ldquo;impossible!\u0026rdquo; Just imagine, can a mother give birth without going through ten months of pregnancy? Can a farmer shorten the growth period of rice seedlings?\nThe growth of wealth is like the growth of life. It\u0026rsquo;s formed bit by bit, day by day, month by month, year by year, under the effect of compound interest. It cannot be achieved overnight. This is the law of nature, and God never changes his natural laws.\nLuck is Not a Long-Term Strategy\nMany investors make a fortune overnight and go bankrupt overnight. Their success is due to luck, and their failure is because \u0026ldquo;you may be lucky for a while, but you cannot always be lucky.\u0026rdquo; Any investment opportunity that promises overnight riches must hide a greater risk of overnight poverty. This is why most of those who fantasize about getting rich quickly through financial management end up losing everything.\nAs long as you are patient and invest your assets in the right investment vehicles, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to actively manage or worry. Compound interest will naturally lead to wealth growth, and becoming a billionaire over time is almost a certainty. In investment and financial management, haste makes waste. \u0026ldquo;Fast\u0026rdquo; is definitely not good!\nIf you really want to get rich quickly, I suggest you try entrepreneurship instead of investment and financial management. If any of the readers want to get rich quickly, what should they do? My sincere suggestion is to choose the path of entrepreneurship. I have studied the wealth accumulation process of many rich people throughout history and found that there are many examples of getting rich quickly through entrepreneurship. Bill Gates, the richest man in the United States, dropped out of college in his freshman year to found Microsoft and became the richest man in the United States in just 20 years.\nHowever, the probability of success in getting rich through entrepreneurship is extremely low. According to statistics from the Taiwan Entrepreneurship Association, the success rate of a person\u0026rsquo;s first business venture is only about 7%, and entrepreneurial success does not necessarily mean getting rich. In other words, for every successful entrepreneur we see, there are at least dozens of unknown failures behind them. Moreover, the entrepreneurial process is very arduous. Working more than ten hours a day seems to be a prerequisite for successful entrepreneurs.\nOn the contrary, as long as the method is correct, investing money in the stock market and property market, and waiting patiently for decades, the probability of getting rich through investment and financial management is very high. It\u0026rsquo;s hard not to get rich, and the process is relatively easy and enjoyable! Which method you choose to get rich is up to you. I must emphasize again that there is a possibility of getting rich quickly through entrepreneurship, but it is absolutely impossible to get rich quickly through financial management.\n","date":"9 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005961/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law II","type":"posts"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law III: Invest Sooner Rather Than Later # Invest first, then wait for the opportunity,\nrather than waiting for the opportunity to invest.\nProcrastination: The Primary Cause of Financial Failure # The mentality of \u0026ldquo;things will work out\u0026rdquo; and a passive approach to financial management is the most common obstacle to personal finance. It\u0026rsquo;s also the main reason why many people struggle to achieve financial independence by retirement. Many individuals adopt a passive attitude towards financial planning, believing that things will naturally fall into place. As they age and witness the rapid growth of others\u0026rsquo; wealth, they finally realize the importance of financial management. However, by then, time is often limited, the power of compound interest cannot be fully utilized, and it becomes too late, even if they understand the principles of financial management.\nFinancial Management Is Not Just for the Middle-Aged\nMany young people believe that financial management is something for middle-aged or wealthy individuals, and that it\u0026rsquo;s not too late to worry about it in old age. Here, I want to remind readers that the ability to build wealth through financial management has little correlation with the amount of money one possesses, but a significant correlation with the length of time invested. People often reach middle age, facing retirement with some savings, and only then start thinking about preparing for their financial future. However, at this point, it\u0026rsquo;s often too late. The reason is insufficient time to allow compound interest to work its magic. Turning small amounts of money into substantial wealth requires at least two to three decades. Recall the previous example: 10 years is not enough time to see significant growth. A much longer period is needed for remarkable results.\nSince we know that building wealth through investment requires investing in high-return assets and leveraging the long-term effects of compound interest, our approach, besides enriching our investment knowledge and skills, should involve immediate action. Financial planning should start as early as possible, cultivating patience and a long-term perspective.\nThe reason for many financial failures today is the lack of knowledge about how to utilize funds effectively to achieve the goal of making money work for you and building wealth through investment. This is a flaw in our education system. Schools dedicate significant time to teaching students how to earn a living but fail to teach them how to manage their earnings. College students exploring financial management through stock investment are often viewed as engaging in speculative and greedy behavior. In a future dominated by finance, the lack of proper financial knowledge not only erodes the dream of wealth accumulation but also harms the financial operations of businesses and the overall prosperity of society.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t delay your financial plan using the excuse of uncertain future price trends. Who can predict when real estate or stock prices will rise? Past price surges always lead to regret for those who missed out. There are no clear signs before prices start to rise, and no one will announce it with fanfare. For investments that are unpredictable in the short term but offer high expected returns in the long term, the safest strategy is to invest first and then wait for the opportunity, not the other way around.\nWarren Buffett Started Investing at Age 11\nI believe every business school graduate should sign a contract pledging to make no more than 20 major decisions in their lifetime. If your career spans 40 years, that\u0026rsquo;s one decision every two years.\nWarren Buffett, ranked the second richest man in America by Forbes magazine in 1996, is widely regarded as the god of stock investment. He claims that more than half of his net worth is attributed to about ten investment decisions. He believes the key to investment is to buy stocks of good companies at good prices and hold them for the long term. As long as these companies continue to perform well, don\u0026rsquo;t sell their stocks.\nBuffett, with a net worth of $9 billion, amassed his fortune entirely from the stock market. At 68, he held an MBA from Columbia University and was the son of a stockbroker-turned-congressman. Buffett made his first investment at the age of 11, putting his and his sister\u0026rsquo;s small savings into the stock market. Initially, he lost money, and his sister criticized him, but he insisted that it would take three to four years to see profits. His sister sold her shares, while he held on, ultimately proving his point.\nAt 20, while studying at Columbia University, Buffett immersed himself in finance books and insurance industry statistics while his peers focused on leisure activities. Lacking capital and disliking borrowing, he often sold stocks prematurely to reinvest in others. Despite the limitations of his funds, his wealth continued to grow.\nIn 1954, he joined Professor Graham\u0026rsquo;s investment firm. Two years later, he raised $100,000 from family and friends and established his own firm. After its assets increased thirtyfold, he dissolved the company in 1969, returned the partners\u0026rsquo; money, and focused on his own investments.\nHe is a true stock market tycoon and has been America\u0026rsquo;s richest man for years. Other wealthy Americans, like Bill Gates and Henry Lea Hillman, built their fortunes through businesses, while Buffett focused on stock investment. As long as the US economy continues to grow, his wealth will continue to increase.\nBuffett\u0026rsquo;s immense wealth, accumulated through nearly 60 years of investing, is a testament to the power of compound interest. His early experiences with trial and error played a crucial role in honing his investment acumen.\nFinancial management is like farming.\nA bountiful harvest in the future depends on diligent sowing and watering today.\nStart Investing Today # If time is an indispensable element of financial management, the best strategy is to act now. Start managing your finances today!\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Wait Until Your Hair Turns White\nThe earlier you start investing, the sooner you\u0026rsquo;ll achieve your financial goals and enjoy the fruits of your labor with your family. Furthermore, starting early maximizes the time for compound interest to work, requiring smaller initial investments and making financial management easier and more enjoyable.\nStarting later requires significantly higher monthly investments to reach the same goals. The following table is based on these assumptions: an annual return of 15%, a target amount of 100 million yuan, and a retirement age of 65. It calculates the required monthly investment for different starting ages.\nMonthly Investment Required to Become a Millionaire, by Starting Age\nStarting Age Monthly Investment (Yuan) 20 2324 25 4684 30 9458 35 19863 40 39163 45 81348 50 175143 55 410428 60 1235959 The table clearly demonstrates that youth is a valuable asset in wealth accumulation. The younger you are, the better positioned you are to achieve the dream of building wealth from small investments. Starting financial planning in old age requires monthly investments that are beyond the reach of most people. In short, start saving for retirement early. Don\u0026rsquo;t wait until your hair turns white; time waits for no one.\nYour future financial well-being depends on your actions today. Don\u0026rsquo;t let hesitation hold you back. Follow the principles outlined in this book, invest your funds in the stock market, real estate, or other high-return investment vehicles, and over time, you too can become wealthy.\n1. The earlier you start investing, the longer the time for compound interest to work, and the sooner you\u0026rsquo;ll achieve your wealth goals.\n2. Only young people can dream of building wealth from small investments.\n3. The best time to start managing your finances is as early as possible.\nJeffrey Koo Jr.\u0026rsquo;s Path to Wealth\nJeffrey Koo Jr., the eldest son of Jeffrey Koo Sr., chairman of Chinatrust Commercial Bank in Taiwan, and current Vice President of Chinatrust, is actively uniting the third generation of Taiwanese entrepreneurs. He organized a luncheon club primarily for the third generation of prominent Taiwanese business families to network and exchange information. To expand its influence, Koo Jr. has also strengthened the luncheon club\u0026rsquo;s connections with Southeast Asian politicians and the second and third generations of overseas Chinese business families.\nKoo Jr. is a representative figure among Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s third-generation entrepreneurs and the heir apparent to his father. Many assume his wealthy background afforded him a comfortable financial situation. However, Koo Sr. instilled frugal habits in his children and didn\u0026rsquo;t provide excessive allowances. Koo Jr. had to find his own ways to become financially independent.\nSent to Japan for his education by his father, Koo Jr. returned to Taiwan for university after graduating high school with only his accumulated New Year\u0026rsquo;s money, around NT$100,000, in his bank account. In early 1987, as the weighted stock price index climbed from 1,000 points, many people invested in the stock market. Koo Jr., then a junior in college, followed suit, investing all his savings. His grandmother\u0026rsquo;s daily routine of asking him to recite the stock market index further influenced him. His frequent interactions with entrepreneurs from various industries provided him with business opportunities, enabling him to grow his NT$100,000 capital to NT$10 million during the bull market.\nWhen the stock market crashed from over 10,000 points in 1990, he was already pursuing his Master\u0026rsquo;s degree at the Wharton School of Business in the US. His father, hoping for him to join the family business sooner, disapproved of his overseas studies and threatened to withhold financial support. Koo Jr. confidently assured his father that he could support himself financially. He successfully completed his studies in the US and even bought his dream car, a Porsche, with his own money. Koo Jr.\u0026rsquo;s knack for investment and financial management from a young age made his dreams a reality. If you aspire to be wealthy, start now!\nYouth Is the Greatest Asset for Financial Success\nSuccessful people have a habit: they delay, but don\u0026rsquo;t give up, the enjoyment of the fruits of their labor.\nIn Louis Cha\u0026rsquo;s novel The Book and the Sword, the Qianlong Emperor tells his sworn brother, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t envy anything about you except your youth.\u0026rdquo; Even the emperor envied youth.\nSimilarly, from a financial perspective, youth is the most important asset. I often tell college students, \u0026ldquo;Young people, your name is wealth!\u0026rdquo; The compound interest formula clearly shows that time is money, and youth is wealth.\nThe compound interest chart provides a clear roadmap for financial planning: focus on increasing income and saving during your youth and start investing early. Money saved during youth contributes significantly to wealth in old age. NT$10,000 saved in your youth can grow to over NT$2.3 million in 30 years. The same amount saved in old age will only grow to NT$60,000 in 10 years. Whether the statement \u0026ldquo;Young people, your name is wealth\u0026rdquo; becomes a reality depends on whether young people manage their finances wisely. Poor financial management, even with the advantage of youth, will not bring wealth.\nThe prevalent notion among young people today is that it\u0026rsquo;s fine to indulge in enjoyment while young and worry about financial planning later. This is a misguided perspective. Many young people believe retirement is far off and their funds are limited, so there\u0026rsquo;s no need to consider investment. They often miss the opportunity to start early.\nIn reality, starting financial planning in old age, even with some savings, is often too late due to limited time. The correct approach is: investing and managing finances is the job of young people, while managing wealth is the job of old age. However, many young people prioritize immediate gratification, spending their money on sports cars, high-end audio systems, or travel, believing they can enjoy life now and worry about finances later.\nIf you understand the role of time in financial management, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see why such individuals are destined for mediocrity. Countless examples in society demonstrate how prioritizing enjoyment in youth leads to poverty in old age. The key is their neglect of the importance of early financial planning. By the time they realize it, it\u0026rsquo;s often too late.\nAs Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s population ages and smaller family structures become the norm, future generations will rely on their own financial resources for living expenses. Therefore, the concept of starting financial planning in youth becomes increasingly critical.\nYouth Is the Best Time for Taking Risks\nYoung people possess the most valuable asset in financial management - time. Youth is also the best time to take risks because family responsibilities are generally lighter. Young people should embrace a risk-taking mindset because the cost of failure is lower. You can recover from setbacks more easily. Moreover, with limited funds, potential losses are smaller, providing valuable learning experiences. Most importantly, young people have ample time for compound interest to work its magic.\nBefore 50, one shouldn\u0026rsquo;t adopt an overly conservative approach to investment and financial management. The best time to learn about financial management is as early as possible. Sound financial judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from mistakes. Since developing good judgment requires making some mistakes along the way, why not gain this experience while you\u0026rsquo;re young and the stakes are lower? By the time you have more capital, you can apply your honed financial judgment effectively.\nYoung people should not just spend money but also understand the importance of saving. Start saving, and once you have a few thousand or tens of thousands of yuan, consider long-term, high-return investments, even if they carry some risk.\nSome may feel they are no longer young and their current income is low, leaving no surplus for investment. Indeed, older individuals have less time to benefit from compound interest. However, don\u0026rsquo;t be discouraged. Money can buy time, and you might still have opportunities to catch up. By following sound financial principles, you can achieve unexpected gains. If you are past 50, help your children by sharing these fundamental wealth-building concepts so they don\u0026rsquo;t miss out on the opportunity to build wealth early in their lives. Instead of giving your next generation money, teach them the knowledge of making money work for them.\n1. Youth is the greatest asset for building wealth through financial management. 2. Young people should embrace risk-taking because the cost of failure is lower. 3. Invest when you\u0026rsquo;re young to maximize the benefits of compound interest over time.\nPlaying a good hand well is nothing special; playing a bad hand well is what deserves admiration.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Neglect Financial Management Due to Limited Funds # Some believe that financial management is exclusive to the wealthy and high-income families, requiring substantial capital to even consider it. Indeed, financial management is about making money work for you. It\u0026rsquo;s not about turning stone into gold or creating something from nothing, so you need some initial capital. However, what many don\u0026rsquo;t realize is that the most influential factors on future wealth, according to the compound interest formula, are the rate of return and the length of the investment period, not the current amount of capital or future contributions.\nSmall Beginnings Can Lead to Great Fortunes\nWith the right approach, even a small amount of money can generate significant wealth over time, as illustrated in previous examples. Even someone with no initial capital, by investing 14,000 yuan annually, can become a millionaire in 40 years. The principle of investment and financial management is this: understanding how to utilize high-return tools and the long-term effects of compound interest is more important than the amount of money invested.\nA common misconception is that financial planning is only necessary after accumulating a large sum of money. In reality, the key factors influencing future wealth are the rate of return and the length of investment period, not the amount of capital. The key to successful financial management lies in maximizing returns and holding investments for the long term. While having more capital can accelerate wealth accumulation, it\u0026rsquo;s not the decisive factor.\nPerhaps you\u0026rsquo;ve considered investing but dismissed the idea due to limited funds. By doing so, you\u0026rsquo;ve missed a valuable opportunity to enhance your investment skills. The focus of investment should not be on \u0026ldquo;how much money is earned\u0026rdquo; but on \u0026ldquo;the rate of return\u0026rdquo; at which money is earned. For example, earning 5,000 yuan on a principal of 100,000 yuan represents a 5% return, which is a poor investment. Earning 2,000 yuan on a principal of 10,000 yuan represents a 20% return, which is a good investment. Over time, the latter will significantly outperform the former. Therefore, the earlier you learn financial management, the better. It allows limited funds to leverage the power of compound interest and create substantial wealth.\nThose with Less Should Strive Harder\nSome may question how to invest with only a few thousand or tens of thousands of yuan. In today\u0026rsquo;s developed financial markets, investment units are highly divisible. Around 10,000 yuan can buy a lower-priced stock, and a few thousand yuan can be invested in mutual funds. Real estate is also moving towards securitization. In short, there will be more investment options for smaller amounts in the future. Therefore, any idle funds not needed in the short term, even a few thousand yuan, should be invested.\nAre people truly too poor to manage small amounts of money? During the Chang Hwa Credit Cooperative bank run, many ordinary people withdrew hundreds of thousands of yuan. Statistics also show that the average bank deposit is 600,000 yuan, which is more than enough for investment purposes.\nEven those with no current savings or expecting limited future income shouldn\u0026rsquo;t underestimate themselves and give up on financial planning. While wealthy or high-income individuals have a head start, those with fewer assets or lower incomes should understand the principles of financial management and leverage it to compensate for their financial disadvantages, ultimately improving their lifetime financial situation.\nMoreover, individuals from humble beginnings and with modest incomes can achieve a greater sense of accomplishment by building wealth through diligent financial management. As the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s nothing remarkable about playing a good hand well; it\u0026rsquo;s playing a bad hand well that deserves admiration.\u0026rdquo; If you truly have no money, find ways to increase income and reduce expenses, save some money, and then start managing your finances. Remember, even a small amount of money is enough to begin. While the path to wealth may be longer and more challenging with limited initial funds, the goal is still achievable, and the journey itself is valuable.\n1. Investment and financial management are not exclusive to the wealthy or high-income earners.\n2. Those with limited assets or low incomes should leverage financial management to catch up.\n3. The amount of money you have when you start doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. Less money might even be better, allowing you to experiment with smaller investments initially and gradually increase your investment as you become more comfortable with risk.\n4. Leverage other people\u0026rsquo;s money to accelerate wealth building.\n","date":"9 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005962/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law III","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"9 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/small-investment/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Small Investment","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/youth-financial-management/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Youth Financial Management","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-09","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%88%9B%E4%B8%9A/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Âàõ‰∏ö","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-09","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%B0%8F%E9%92%B1%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Â∞èÈí±ÊäïËµÑ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-09","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%B9%B4%E8%BD%BB%E4%BA%BA%E7%90%86%E8%B4%A2/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Âπ¥ËΩª‰∫∫ÁêÜË¥¢","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-09","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%B2%83%E4%BC%A6%E5%B7%B4%E8%8F%B2%E7%89%B9/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Ê≤É‰º¶¬∑Â∑¥Ëè≤Áâπ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-09","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E7%90%86%E8%B4%A2%E8%A7%82%E5%BF%B5/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÁêÜË¥¢ËßÇÂøµ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-09","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E8%80%90%E5%BF%83/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ËÄêÂøÉ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/family-precepts/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Family Precepts","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/financial-education/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Financial Education","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/income-and-expenditure/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Income and Expenditure","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/nobel-prize-foundation/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Nobel Prize Foundation","type":"tags"},{"content":" Investment Iron Law I: Don\u0026rsquo;t Keep Your Money in the Bank # The vast majority of people who fail at financial management don\u0026rsquo;t do so because they don\u0026rsquo;t earn enough, but because they put their assets in the wrong place. Have you ever heard of anyone getting rich from bank savings?\nSaving Equals Wasting Resources # There\u0026rsquo;s a parable in the Bible about financial stewardship. A landowner entrusted his property to three servants. He gave the first servant five units of money, the second two, and the third one. He told them to cherish and manage their wealth wisely, and he would return in a year to see how they had fared.\nWasting Time and Money\nThe first servant invested his money; the second bought raw materials and produced goods to sell; the third, for safety, buried his money under a tree. A year later, the landowner returned. The first two servants had doubled their wealth, pleasing the landowner. Only the third servant\u0026rsquo;s money remained unchanged. He explained, \u0026ldquo;Fearing loss through mismanagement, I kept the money safe. Today, I return it untouched.\u0026rdquo;\nThe landowner was furious. \u0026ldquo;You lazy servant!\u0026rdquo; he scolded. \u0026ldquo;You didn\u0026rsquo;t even try to utilize your wealth!\u0026rdquo; Wealth not utilized is wasted money and wasted potential. The third servant was rebuked not for misusing the money, nor for losing it through failed investments, but for keeping it \u0026ldquo;safe\u0026rdquo; and unproductive.\nKeeping money in the bank is the most common approach to personal finance today, and also the biggest mistake people make. Therefore, the first and most important financial rule this book offers is: Don\u0026rsquo;t keep your money in the bank. \u0026ldquo;Bank\u0026rdquo; here refers to post offices, commercial banks, and any other financial institution where money can be deposited.\nMany believe that earning interest in a bank, benefiting from compound interest, constitutes sound financial planning. In reality, with inflation, the real rate of return is close to zero, meaning no real financial gain. Therefore, leaving money in the bank is equivalent to no financial management at all.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s impossible to predict how much wealth each person will accumulate through financial management. The only certainty is that getting rich solely through bank savings is incredibly difficult. Ask yourself, \u0026ldquo;Have you ever heard of anyone getting rich purely from bank deposits?\u0026rdquo; Those who keep all their savings in the bank often find themselves not only failing to become wealthy in their old age but also struggling to maintain financial independence. Such stories are common. Those who choose bank deposits as their primary financial management method do so primarily for safety. However, readers must understand: \u0026ldquo;Money in the bank is safest in the short term, but the most dangerous form of financial management in the long term.\u0026rdquo;\nBlind Spots in Personal Finance\nMost people manage their finances by keeping their money in the bank, so most people are not wealthy.\nIf accumulating immense wealth were as easy as the examples suggest, then most people over 65 today would be millionaires. However, this is far from reality. Millionaires over 65 are few and far between, with many senior citizens facing financial hardship, relying on continued work or support from their children to make ends meet.\nSurveys on the elderly in Taiwan reveal increasingly serious financial challenges for senior citizens. Among approximately 1.48 million people aged 65 and above, about 13% rely on financial assistance from family and friends or social welfare. This demonstrates a serious problem with most people\u0026rsquo;s financial concepts and investment methods. How else could they reach old age not only without wealth but without even basic financial independence?\nTaiwan\u0026rsquo;s savings rate has historically been above 30%, currently hovering between 20% and 30%, consistently ranking among the highest globally. This indicates excellent performance in saving and budgeting. Consequently, we can deduce that flawed financial management is the primary reason for the lack of financial independence among ordinary people. To understand where they go wrong, we must first observe how they handle their assets. In various lectures, I often ask the audience, \u0026ldquo;How are your assets stored?\u0026rdquo; The majority answer: \u0026ldquo;In the bank.\u0026rdquo;\nPrioritizing Security over Investment\nSurveys on Taiwanese household investment preferences reveal that the top three investment choices are demand deposits (72%), rotating savings and credit associations (53%), and time deposits (36%). Clearly, most people lean towards traditional financial methods. Furthermore, when asked, \u0026ldquo;If you had 10 million Taiwan dollars in savings, how would you use it?\u0026rdquo;, about 41% of surveyed households said they would deposit it in a financial institution to earn interest. This illustrates the widespread preference for bank savings.\nIndeed, people have high savings rates and a strong preference for depositing money in financial institutions to earn interest. In early 1996, total deposits in Taiwanese financial institutions reached 12.6 trillion Taiwan dollars. With a population of 21 million, this translates to an average deposit of 600,000 Taiwan dollars per person, regardless of age. For an average family of four, this amounts to 2.4 million Taiwan dollars. This demonstrates a strong inclination towards bank savings. However, this traditional and conservative approach is the primary reason why most people fail to achieve wealth through investment.\nThis phenomenon reveals an over-reliance on traditional bank deposits for financial management. People prioritize safety and convenience over the rate of return. However, focusing solely on earning and saving money, then depositing it in a bank, is often the first step towards financial mismanagement.\nKeeping money in the bank is like having no financial plan at all.\nDeposit Interest Rates Lack True Compound Interest Benefits # What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with bank deposits? The problem lies in the low interest rates (return on investment), making them unsuitable for long-term investment tools.\nHow much interest can bank deposits earn? The salaries of average office workers are usually directly deposited into demand deposit accounts (current interest rates around 2%-4%). A portion serves as temporary funds or covers daily expenses, while the remainder is transferred to time deposits (current interest rates around 5%-8%) for investment purposes. Thus, the average interest rate earned on bank deposits is about 5%.\n5% Interest is Hardly a Path to Wealth\nMost people have a basic understanding of compound interest, believing that interest earned on bank deposits, accumulating over time, can create substantial wealth. This misconception arises from a superficial understanding of compounding. The vast differences in final returns resulting from different rates of return on the same principal over the same period often come as a surprise.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s illustrate with an example. Suppose someone saves 14,000 Taiwan dollars annually at the end of each year for 40 years, depositing everything into a bank account with an average interest rate of 5%. How much will they accumulate after 40 years? Before answering, recall the similar example from the previous section, but with the money in a bank instead of invested in stocks or real estate with an average annual return of 20%.\nYou might guess 25 million, 10 million, or even a conservative 5 million Taiwan dollars. The correct answer, however, is only 1.69 million. This can be calculated using the future value of an annuity formula:\n14,000√ó(1+0.05)40‚àí10.05=1,690,00014,000√ó(1+0.20)40‚àí10.20=102,810,000\nLet\u0026rsquo;s compare this with the 20% return scenario. The only difference between the two formulas is the rate of return (5% vs. 20%). A 20% return over 40 years yields 102.81 million Taiwan dollars, while a 5% return over the same period yields only 1.69 million, less than a fraction of the former. The difference is over 60 times! This illustrates the power of compound interest. Many assume they benefit from compound interest in a bank, but at a 5% return, even with compounding over a long period, the wealth creation effect is very limited.\nThis example demonstrates that one of the keys to successful financial management is the rate of return. The key is not just whether your assets are invested, but where they are invested and what the rate of return is.\nThe key to financial management lies in how your assets are allocated. The rate of return has a decisive impact on your future wealth. While bank savings provide interest income and the benefit of compounding, you\u0026rsquo;ll find that as you age, bank deposits contribute little to overall wealth growth. The first step towards building wealth through investment is to allocate assets to investments with high long-term rates of return. \u0026ldquo;Financial Management\u0026rdquo; is a significant factor contributing to wealth disparity in society. Inflation makes money worth less and less.\nThe Invisible Killer of Currency Value: Inflation # Forty years ago, a millionaire was truly wealthy. Today, a millionaire might struggle to afford a house. Why? Inflation. Every investor must consider the impact of inflation.\nInflation reduces the purchasing power of money and lowers the real rate of return, diminishing the effect of wealth accumulation.\nOver the past 30 years, the average annual inflation rate in Taiwan has been around 5%. What about the future? Inflation and economic growth are closely linked. As Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s economy continues to grow, inflation is expected to remain around 5% annually.\nInflation means continuously rising prices, which translates to decreasing purchasing power. If you keep your money in a demand deposit account earning 4% interest with a 5% inflation rate, what happens? Your purchasing power decreases. The longer your money sits in a savings account, the less it\u0026rsquo;s worth. What used to cost 10 Taiwan dollars for a newspaper now costs 15. Your 10 dollars can now only buy two-thirds of a newspaper. With inflation, money in the bank shrinks like wool submerged in water.\nSaving Alone Won\u0026rsquo;t Make You Rich, Not Even in Two Lifetimes\nWith 5% inflation and a nominal interest rate of around 5% on bank deposits, your real rate of return is zero. In this scenario, the effect of compound interest is nullified. Wealth accumulation relies solely on painstaking saving. Imagine someone saves 500,000 Taiwan dollars a year. How long would it take to become a billionaire? 200 years!\nSaving 500,000 Taiwan dollars a year is difficult; living for 200 years is even harder! Therefore, even with diligent saving and budgeting, if all the money is kept in the bank, this person won\u0026rsquo;t become wealthy in this lifetime, and worse, not even in the next! The average lifespan is around 75 years, meaning two lifetimes total only 150 years. It would take a third lifetime for someone relying solely on bank savings to potentially reach billionaire status. If a family maintains the financial strategy of \u0026ldquo;frugality and bank savings,\u0026rdquo; it would take at least 200 years, or about seven generations, for them to potentially become wealthy. Conversely, with proper financial management, wealth can be achieved in 40 years (half a lifetime).\nMoney in the Bank Should Be Spent Sooner Rather Than Later\nI remember 30 years ago, when I was in second or third grade, a popsicle cost 20 cents, and a red bean ice cream cost 50 cents. My parents gave me 50 cents each day for allowance, which I invariably spent on red bean ice cream after school. My parents constantly encouraged me to save, so my father opened a bank account for me. If I had been obedient and developed good saving habits from a young age, saving those 50 cents daily and earning 8% interest, it would have grown tenfold over 30 years, to 5 Taiwan dollars. However, a red bean ice cream now costs 15 Taiwan dollars. Those 5 dollars can only buy one-third of a red bean ice cream. More importantly, for aÂ∞èÂ≠¶Áîü 30 years ago, a red bean ice cream was precious. Even a dozen red bean ice creams today couldn\u0026rsquo;t compare to the value of one back then. Had I followed my parents\u0026rsquo; financial advice and kept my money in the bank, I would regret it now.\nTherefore, if you\u0026rsquo;re going to keep money in the bank, my sincere advice is: \u0026ldquo;Spend it sooner rather than later!\u0026rdquo; This might sound shocking, but there\u0026rsquo;s logic to it. From an economic perspective, money has more value and higher utility when used sooner. We save money in the bank, delaying gratification for the sake of greater enjoyment in the future. However, with inflation, money left in the bank often leads to less enjoyment.\nThe Value of Money Decreases with Age\nMy wife and her friends developed a financial philosophy: \u0026ldquo;Money is most valuable when spent while young.\u0026rdquo; This makes economic sense. Their reasoning: \u0026ldquo;When you\u0026rsquo;re old, delicacies might harm your health, traveling becomes difficult, and most importantly, wearing beautiful clothes attracts unwanted attention and ridicule.\u0026rdquo;\nThus, everyone managing their finances must be mindful of the dual pressures of inflation and the diminishing value of money with age. Bank deposit interest rates cannot compensate for these losses. In other words, money in the bank, while nominally increasing, actually decreases in value.\nOf course, I\u0026rsquo;m not encouraging you to spend all your savings immediately. Rather, I\u0026rsquo;m highlighting that if you keep money in the bank, you must consider the declining purchasing power due to inflation and the reduced economic benefit as you age. The fundamental solution is to withdraw your money from the bank and invest it in instruments with higher returns than bank deposit rates. Therefore, the best way to combat inflation is: Don\u0026rsquo;t keep your money in the bank. Invest in long-term, high-return assets like stocks and real estate.\nBecause inflation decreases real returns and hinders wealth accumulation, even saving 14,000 Taiwan dollars annually and investing in stocks or real estate for 40 years to become a billionaire won\u0026rsquo;t carry the same weight as being a billionaire today. Therefore, under inflation, consider using the real rate of return. If the return on investment is 20% and inflation is 5%, the real return is 15%. So how much should you save annually, investing in stocks or real estate with a nominal return of around 20% (real return of 15%), to become a billionaire in 40 years? The answer is 57,000 Taiwan dollars per year.\n57,000√ó(1+0.15)40‚àí10.15=101,410,000\nA small step today makes a world of difference tomorrow.\nThe Path to Wealth of Chang Pin-san, Former Chairman of Chang Hwa Bank # Chang Po-hsin, the current standing director of Chang Hwa Bank, with assets exceeding tens of billions, inherited and expanded upon the fortune of his father, Chang Pin-san, the former chairman of Chang Hwa Bank, earning him a place among Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s wealthiest individuals.\nTrading Bank Deposits for Stock Dividends\nForty years ago, both Chang Pin-san and my father were from Nantun District, Taichung City. They were not only fellow townsmen but also colleagues. Back then, Chang Pin-san was just a junior manager at Chang Hwa Bank, without much wealth. However, he borrowed money to buy Chang Hwa Bank shares from colleagues who wanted to sell them. At the time, stock dividends were far lower than bank interest. Despite this, Chang Pin-san persisted in borrowing money to acquire shares, holding onto them for the long term. Other colleagues deposited the proceeds from their stock sales into banks. Years later, Chang Pin-san, owning the most shares, became the largest shareholder and eventually the chairman of Chang Hwa Bank, laying the foundation for his immense wealth.\nChang Pin-san was also friends with Lien Chen-tung, father of Lien Chan, and encouraged him to buy Chang Hwa Bank shares. The Lien family\u0026rsquo;s fortune also originated from those hundreds of Chang Hwa Bank shares.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to believe that the path to wealth could be so simple: borrow money to buy a few Chang Hwa Bank shares, invest in some real estate, hold them long-term, and essentially forget about them. Decades later, great wealth is attained. Those who sold their shares and deposited the money in banks are still wondering how others became rich. Some might attribute this to luck, but financial management is not about luck. It\u0026rsquo;s about the method chosen and the investment tools selected. Therefore, if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be poor, don\u0026rsquo;t keep your money in the bank.\nBank Savings Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t Exceed Living Expenses\nSomeone once jokingly asked me, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re telling us not to keep money in the bank. Are we supposed to pay with stocks or real estate certificates at the supermarket or restaurant?\u0026rdquo; Of course not! Advising against keeping money in the bank doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you can\u0026rsquo;t have any money in the bank at all. Bank deposits offer advantages: security and convenience. They are ideal for storing funds needed for daily expenses. However, you can\u0026rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too. Convenience comes at the cost of high returns.\nThe wise approach is to clearly divide funds into two categories: daily expenses and investments. Keep enough for daily needs in the bank, enjoying the security and convenience it offers. Invest the rest in higher-return assets like stocks and real estate.\nIn my opinion, keeping the equivalent of two months\u0026rsquo; living expenses in the bank is sufficient for an individual or family. Most individuals and families receive regular income, which is deposited into their bank accounts. Therefore, one month\u0026rsquo;s expenses for immediate use and another month\u0026rsquo;s worth as a safety net should be ample. The remaining funds should be invested in higher-return assets like stocks and real estate. In other words, if your monthly expenses average 50,000 Taiwan dollars, and your bank balance consistently exceeds 100,000, you are not managing your finances effectively. Actively seek suitable investment opportunities to make your surplus funds work for you.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Two Big, One Small\u0026rdquo; Approach to Flexible Fund Management\nSome believe in maintaining substantial emergency funds. However, even if unforeseen circumstances drain your bank savings, there\u0026rsquo;s no need to panic. The high-return investments mentioned earlier‚Äîstocks and real estate‚Äîare not as illiquid as some might think. Listed stocks in Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s active stock market can be sold almost any day of the year (excluding holidays), providing quick access to cash within a few days. Reluctant to sell? Stocks can also be used as collateral for loans.\nReal estate is less liquid than stocks, but many Taiwanese banks now offer \u0026ldquo;revolving mortgage loans,\u0026rdquo; allowing property owners to convert fixed assets into liquid assets. These loans involve mortgaging a property to secure a credit line of up to 70%-75% of the property\u0026rsquo;s value. Borrowers can draw and repay funds as needed, with interest accruing only on the outstanding balance. For example, a 10 million Taiwan dollar property could secure a 7.5 million credit line. Borrowing 5 million leaves 2.5 million available without interest charges, with interest accruing only on the 5 million borrowed. Any surplus funds can be used to repay the loan, reducing interest costs.\nMany financial experts recommend a \u0026ldquo;three-part\u0026rdquo; approach, dividing assets equally among bank savings, real estate, and more speculative investments. I propose a \u0026ldquo;two big, one small\u0026rdquo; approach: allocate most of your assets to stocks and real estate, keeping a small portion in a bank for daily expenses. This isn\u0026rsquo;t my invention. In fact, this is the portfolio strategy employed by many who have achieved wealth through investments.\nKeeping money in the bank is the riskiest form of financial management. Inflation erodes returns, leaving real interest rates near zero. Banks offer convenience, not high returns. Keep only two months\u0026rsquo; worth of living expenses in the bank. Trying to get rich with money in the bank is like trying to win a baseball game without swinging the bat. If all this hasn\u0026rsquo;t convinced you to reconsider keeping most of your money in a financial institution, perhaps the story of the Nobel Prize Foundation\u0026rsquo;s success might change your mind.\nChange your asset management perspective, change your financial destiny.\nLessons from the Nobel Prize Foundation # Every October, the Nobel Committee announces the Nobel laureates. The Nobel Prize attracts global attention not only for representing the highest academic honor but also because each laureate receives a substantial prize of 1 million US dollars.\nThe Folly of Depleting Capital\nThe Nobel Foundation awards several prizes annually, disbursing millions of dollars. This raises the question: How large is the Nobel fund to sustain such substantial payouts? The Nobel Foundation\u0026rsquo;s success, besides the substantial initial donation by Alfred Nobel over a century ago, is largely attributed to its shrewd financial management.\nEstablished in 1896 with a 9.8 million US dollar donation from Nobel, the foundation\u0026rsquo;s purpose is to fund the prizes. Flawless fund management was paramount. Initially, its charter stipulated that investments be restricted to safe, fixed-income instruments like bank deposits and government bonds, explicitly excluding stocks and real estate to avoid market risks.\nThis capital preservation approach, prioritizing safety over returns, seemed prudent, preventing losses. However, sacrificing returns had consequences. After 50 years of prize payouts and operating expenses, low returns depleted two-thirds of the Nobel fund, leaving only a little over 3 million US dollars by 1953.\nFrom 3 Million to 270 Million: The Secret\nFacing depletion, the Nobel Foundation\u0026rsquo;s board recognized the importance of investment returns. In 1953, they made a groundbreaking change, amending the charter to shift from bank deposits and bonds to primarily stocks and real estate. This shift in investment philosophy transformed the foundation\u0026rsquo;s fate. Over the next 40 years, despite continued prize payouts and operating costs, the foundation not only recovered all previous losses but also grew its assets to 270 million US dollars by 1993.\nNobel Prize Foundation Asset Growth and Decline\nYear Total Assets (Million USD) Remarks 1896 9.8 Foundation Established 1953 3.3 Investment Charter Amended 1993 270 Had the Nobel Foundation not changed its approach 40 years ago, clinging to bank savings, it would have vanished, unable to fund the prizes. Perhaps other wealthy individuals would have established new foundations with larger prizes, replacing the Nobel Prize.\nThe Nobel Foundation\u0026rsquo;s history underscores the importance of financial management. Even a substantial initial fund, if mismanaged, can be depleted. Conversely, even with significant spending, skillful management can generate rapid growth.\nI once heard of a Taiwanese hometown association that established a foundation with 100,000 Taiwan dollars 40 years ago to provide scholarships for children from their hometown. Forty years later, the fund remains at 100,000 Taiwan dollars. While a significant sum back then, today it barely covers administrative costs, threatening the foundation\u0026rsquo;s existence. The problem? Neglecting financial management.\nLearning from the Nobel Foundation, many US foundations, pension funds, university endowments, and even personal trusts have shifted from bank deposits and bonds to primarily stocks and real estate. In contrast, few Taiwanese foundations grasp this concept, and university endowments rarely address financial management seriously. The fate of these foundations, if they don\u0026rsquo;t adapt, is clear.\nI often participate in corporate training programs, where I habitually ask companies about the size and investment strategy of their employee welfare funds. The answers are usually similar: small funds, mostly in bank deposits, rarely exceeding a few hundred thousand or a million Taiwan dollars. However, in 1990, during my time at China Development Corporation, the employee welfare fund exceeded 200 million Taiwan dollars. Why? Because it was primarily invested in China Development Corporation\u0026rsquo;s own stock.\nThe Nobel Foundation\u0026rsquo;s course correction 40 years ago secured its status today. Prioritizing security above all else leads to asset depletion. The growth and decline of wealth for individuals, families, businesses, or other entities depends on their investment strategy. Will your hard-earned wealth shrink like the early Nobel fund, or grow like the later one? The key lies in how you invest. If, like many, you keep most of your money in the bank, it\u0026rsquo;s not too late to change. The Nobel Foundation\u0026rsquo;s story shows how a change in investment philosophy can transform everything. Should you reconsider your financial habits and prioritize investments in stocks and real estate? Let the Nobel Foundation inspire your financial thinking. A single change in mindset can lead to immense wealth decades from now!\n","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005960/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Investment Iron Law I","type":"posts"},{"content":" Synopsis\nWritten by Mr. Huang Peiyuan from Taiwan, this book\u0026rsquo;s greatest strength lies in its departure from traditional thinking. It uses clear and easy-to-understand language to teach correct wealth management methods. The book outlines thirteen ironclad rules for effortless wealth management, guiding readers on how to establish a correct view of financial management. Many people strive to make money but don\u0026rsquo;t know how. Many possess the conditions for wealth but miss opportunities due to a lack of financial literacy. Even worse, some lose everything due to investment mistakes. The author draws on practical experience and extensive academic research, exploring these thirteen ironclad rules to help you \u0026ldquo;enjoy wealth management, achieve wealth with ease,\u0026rdquo; and confidently join the ranks of millionaires. About the Author\nHuang Peiyuan, Ph.D. in Business Administration from the University of California, Berkeley, General Manager of Sancai Construction and Real Estate Co., Ltd. Former Director of the Institute of Business Administration, Tunghai University, Deputy Director of the Project Business Department, China Development Trust Company, Vice President of East-West Securities, USA, Investment Manager at Merrill Lynch, USA, and financial advisor to numerous companies. Learning Wealth Management from the Lien Chan Family # The people of Taiwan are not only surprised by the enormous wealth of the Lien Chan family, the former chairman of the Kuomintang, but also harbor doubts. How could two generations of civil servants, with their meager salaries, accumulate wealth comparable to that of tycoon families?\nThis suspicion is deeply ingrained, but the Lien family is a prominent political family in Taiwan, and no one wants to antagonize them by probing too deeply.\nAs a journalist, the Lien family\u0026rsquo;s wealth has always been a puzzle to me. I even made a determined effort to uncover the truth, but to no avail. Six months ago, Professor Huang Peiyuan, then director of the Institute of Business Administration at Tunghai University, spoke about his desire to combine theory and practice and publish a \u0026ldquo;Personal Investment Bible.\u0026rdquo; After reading Professor Huang\u0026rsquo;s manuscript, the mystery of the Lien family\u0026rsquo;s wealth became clear to me. The Lien family is a perfect example of the principles in this \u0026ldquo;Personal Investment Bible.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps Lien Ya-tang, in his early years, wrote not only the renowned \u0026ldquo;General History of Taiwan,\u0026rdquo; but also a \u0026ldquo;Wealth Management Manual\u0026rdquo; passed down only within the family.\nAccording to Professor Huang\u0026rsquo;s (his title at the time; now he is in business) \u0026ldquo;Personal Investment Bible,\u0026rdquo; the first rule is \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t keep your money in the bank.\u0026rdquo; The second is that if you want to get rich, invest in stocks and real estate. This gives you the opportunity, with the income of an average office worker, to become a multimillionaire after 40 years of wealth management.\nBy this standard, the Lien family is indeed the most faithful follower of the \u0026ldquo;Personal Investment Bible.\u0026rdquo; When they had little wealth, Lien\u0026rsquo;s mother (Lien Chan\u0026rsquo;s mother) invested solely in stocks and real estate. Over the past few decades, the Lien family remained steadfast, waiting for the appreciation of their stocks and real estate, which naturally led to the vast wealth that now arouses public suspicion.\nSeveral decades ago, there were many business people who possessed similar wealth to the Lien family. These individuals also worked hard to manage their businesses and accumulate more wealth. However, compared to the Lien family now, most of them lament their inferiority in terms of wealth. The Lien family\u0026rsquo;s role as pure investors fully demonstrates that \u0026ldquo;as long as the concepts and methods are correct, wealth will naturally follow.\u0026rdquo;\nIn fact, the theories and methods in the \u0026ldquo;Personal Investment Bible\u0026rdquo; have been discussed by countless scholars and experts in mature Western societies, but not many have truly adhered to them and become millionaires as a result. The reason lies not in the inadequacy of the theories and methods, but in the lack of confidence and patience of those who apply them, leading them to give up halfway.\nTherefore, I advise all readers of this book to truly believe in the theories presented, have long-term patience, and adhere to them unwaveringly in order to succeed.\nWe wish all readers the ability to enjoy a happy retirement with sufficient financial resources, which is perhaps the greatest contribution of the \u0026ldquo;Personal Investment Bible\u0026rdquo; to the public! (This article is written by the president of Business Weekly Taiwan)\nThe Joy of Wealth Management, Achieving Wealth with Ease # When I was young, I thought that money was the most important thing in life; now that I am old, I know that it is.\n‚Äî Oscar Wilde, British playwright\nThis book is written for those who are determined to become wealthy and strive for financial independence. If you have tried every possible way to get rich and your home is filled with investment books, but you still can\u0026rsquo;t figure out how to achieve wealth in your lifetime, congratulations! You have found the book you need. The investment and financial management concepts and methods described in this book are absolutely understandable and achievable for everyone. As long as you put them into practice, becoming a millionaire is not difficult.\nI see many people working tirelessly to make money, hoping to improve their own and their families\u0026rsquo; financial situation, but they can\u0026rsquo;t find the right way. Many people clearly have the conditions to become rich through financial management, but they don\u0026rsquo;t know how to manage their finances, resulting in missed opportunities. Others know that investment and financial management can lead to wealth, but the problem is that what they know is not true, leading them astray and suffering from financial mismanagement. The author sees these phenomena and often feels sorry for them.\nThe biggest problem in Taiwan at present is the serious lack of financial education. The public lacks a correct concept of financial management. They either don\u0026rsquo;t know how to manage their finances and neglect it, or they use the wrong methods. As a result, some people not only fail to achieve wealth through financial management, but even fail to achieve basic financial independence. Insufficient or incorrect financial concepts are harmful not only to one\u0026rsquo;s own financial situation, but also to the public. This is the main motivation for the author to write this book, and what this book offers readers is the correct basic concept of investment and financial management.\nAs a scholar and a practitioner of financial management, I feel obligated to share my years of investment research results and practical experience in financial management with everyone, helping the public to easily manage their finances and achieve wealth through investment. The message this book wants to convey is: Financial management is actually very simple. Not only can everyone do it easily, but almost all young people have the conditions to achieve wealth through financial management.\nThis book is based on 20 years of practical financial management experience in the United States and Taiwan, 6 years of investment research at Tunghai University, and 15 years of experience as a financial advisor. In fact, the concepts and practices in this book were developed 3 years ago. For the past 3 years, the author has given lectures on this topic in various places and received tremendous feedback. Many listeners have continuously requested that I compile these concepts and action guidelines into a book. I personally also feel that these financial management concepts and action guidelines are indeed beneficial to the public and there is indeed a need to publish a book.\nHowever, putting these concepts into words is a difficult task for me, so I have procrastinated for 3 years. Recently, thanks to the repeated urging of Mr. He, President of Business Weekly Cultural Enterprise, and Ms. Sun Meiqing, and the examples and suggestions provided by Ms. Shen Wenci, and especially the efforts of Mr. Yang Weikai, who spent several months helping me revise and proofread, this book has finally been completed. I express my sincere gratitude here.\nIf this book can be read by the general public, and if they can accept the concepts and financial management methods described in the book, then all the author\u0026rsquo;s efforts will have been truly worthwhile. Good ideas should be shared with everyone. I hope everyone can benefit from them and easily become millionaires through financial management.\nFinally, I dedicate this book to my parents, Mr. Huang Minting and Ms. Huang Juzhi, who raised and nurtured me.\nPreface # In recent years, Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s economy has grown rapidly. While continuous economic growth is certainly gratifying, the problem of uneven wealth distribution has become increasingly serious. Some blame inappropriate government policies, while others believe it\u0026rsquo;s due to speculation, which has caused stock and housing prices to rise, widening the gap between rich and poor. The author believes that these factors are not the main cause. The real reason for the widening wealth gap is the significant disparity in financial literacy among the public.\nStarting in 1986, Taiwan officially entered an era of abundant capital and a focus on wealth management. The New Taiwan dollar slowly appreciated from 40 to 27 against the US dollar, and during this period, a large amount of foreign exchange flowed into Taiwan, creating a situation where \u0026ldquo;money overflowed in Taiwan.\u0026rdquo;\nDue to the excess capital, people began to shift their money towards investing in stocks and real estate. The huge influx of funds into the stock and housing markets caused stock and housing prices to soar. Between 1986 and 1989, housing prices increased by an average of two to four times, and the weighted stock market index rose from over 700 points in early 1986 to 12,680 points in February 1990, an increase of 18 times. Investing in stocks and participating in the capital market is inherently meaningful, and rising stock prices are a natural consequence of economic growth. Unfortunately, most investors adopted the wrong approach, believing that to profit in the stock market, they must buy low and sell high, earning the difference. In reality, short-term trading is not only time-consuming and laborious but also incurs huge transaction costs, resulting in most investors losing money. The stock market is almost equated with a casino.\nThe purpose of this book is to enlighten the public\u0026rsquo;s financial mindset by providing new perspectives, concepts, and methods to cope with the important yet complex investment environment. The author sincerely hopes that after reading this book, readers will develop a new financial mentality and adopt correct financial management methods.\n\u0026ldquo;Getting rich\u0026rdquo; is almost everyone\u0026rsquo;s desire, and most people think that their monthly income is not much, and the amount they can save is even less. At this rate of wealth accumulation, it seems impossible to get rich. But in fact, with enough time and proper financial management, becoming a millionaire is not impossible. Wealth accumulation through financial management requires only three basic conditions: regular savings, the pursuit of high returns, and long-term waiting.\nThe easiest way to achieve wealth through financial management is to learn from those who have done so. What are their methods? The secret of most successful wealth managers is not that they are smarter, harder working, or luckier than others, but that they have the habits and practices of wealth creation.\nIn the past, family financial management was rarely mentioned in school education. Perhaps this is because investment and financial management involve money, and most people think that making money with money has a connotation of getting something for nothing. In formal school education, teachers avoid mentioning it, believing that talking about money in education may corrupt people\u0026rsquo;s minds, especially making money with money, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem noble. However, long-term avoidance of this issue has only exacerbated the problem.\nThe people of Taiwan, through years of joint efforts, have created an economic miracle and accumulated a large amount of wealth. However, most individuals and families only know how to make money but not how to manage it, let alone how to use it wisely. After acquiring wealth, individuals, families, and even the entire society have suffered rather than benefited. For example, in recent years, money games have been prevalent. Many people are busy speculating in stocks and real estate, and various forms of gambling such as the Mark Six lottery, futures, and foreign exchange margin trading are still popular and becoming increasingly rampant. Many people are obsessed with money games, all for the purpose of making money and improving their family\u0026rsquo;s financial situation. However, if we calmly review the investment results of the past few years, it is not difficult to find that in the end, few have profited, many have lost, and even more have gone bankrupt. Everyone has worked in vain, and the result is only a rapid redistribution of wealth and a prevalence of unhealthy speculation in society. The wealth of individuals and society as a whole does not increase. This is all due to the public\u0026rsquo;s lack of clear understanding of financial management concepts.\nThe consequence of poor financial literacy is not only personal loss and family misfortune but also a waste of overall social resources. Let\u0026rsquo;s face this issue that is crucial to individuals, families, and the entire society: family financial management.\nAs the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;When a couple is poor, everything is sad.\u0026rdquo; This shows that if a family\u0026rsquo;s financial situation cannot meet the needs of family life, or if finances are not managed properly, happiness is hard to come by. Of course, there are many factors that contribute to a happy family, and wealth is only one of them, as many family problems cannot be solved with money. There is a saying: \u0026ldquo;Money is not everything, but without money, you can do nothing.\u0026rdquo; Although money is not the center of a family, in our real society, most good things require money. Wealthy families are not necessarily happy, but families without money are usually even less so. To make ourselves and our families happier, investment and financial management are indeed imperative. Investment and financial management can not only improve the financial situation of an individual or a family, but it is also a good way to accumulate wealth. Using financial management to achieve wealth is achievable for everyone, and it is something everyone should do.\nFuture wealth depends on the future investment environment, and the biggest characteristic of the investment environment, in a word, is change. The entire financial environment is ever-changing and unpredictable. This has been true in the past and will be even more so in the future. In the world of investment and financial management, there is constant change. It can be said that \u0026ldquo;the only constant is change.\u0026rdquo; It is foreseeable that the changes in the next 10 years will exceed those of the previous 50 years. Changes are not only becoming faster, but also more complex, diversified, and international. Whether we like it or not, we are already in a rapidly changing environment.\nFacing change, you can remain calm, adapt, and adopt the appropriate mental attitude. However, if you know how change will affect you, you may not dare to take it lightly. Because the natural consequence of any change is redistribution, including wealth, power, markets, personnel\u0026hellip; In terms of wealth, any change in the investment environment will naturally affect the flow of money at all levels. Indeed, in financial markets, capital markets, commodity markets, spot or futures markets worldwide, billions of dollars are traded every day, and wealth is constantly being redistributed. Your wealth may increase significantly during the redistribution process, or it may shrink rapidly. After long-term redistribution, you may become a billionaire, or you may become penniless, depending on how you face and deal with the changes.\nAny change and the resulting redistribution poses a \u0026ldquo;crisis\u0026rdquo; to your wealth to a greater or lesser extent. The Chinese characters for \u0026ldquo;crisis\u0026rdquo; are profound and often quoted in foreign books because they contain both danger and opportunity. \u0026ldquo;Wei\u0026rdquo; represents the threat to wealth, and \u0026ldquo;Ji\u0026rdquo; represents the opportunity for wealth creation.\nWe can wait for changes and redistribution to determine our future wealth level, or we can make good use of the opportunities brought about by change and try to reduce its destructive power. In this era of accelerating change, cultivating the ability to manage and respond to change is essential to controlling our own future.\nLooking ahead, changes in business, economy, finance, politics, society, and other aspects will accelerate. The overall financial environment will become more complex and unpredictable, and it is foreseeable that future wealth redistribution will inevitably accelerate. Therefore, for ourselves, our families, and society, everyone should play the role of a financial manager.\nThis is an era of rapid change and abundant wealth, and it is also an era that forces us to manage our finances. Everyone desires to become rich and improve their living standards or achieve their life goals. There are many ways to get rich, but the concept the author wants to elaborate on in this book is: Investment and financial management is one of the effective methods to achieve wealth. As long as you have the correct financial management concepts and put them into practice, whether you are rich or poor now, over time, you may become a millionaire through investment and financial management.\nIn this critical era related to our future wealth, you can no longer remain indifferent to financial management or ignorant of investment. You must adopt the correct financial concepts as early as possible, constantly acquire new knowledge, and avoid mistakes in order to win in the process of wealth redistribution.\nThe Story of the Mailman Who Got Rich\nMy brother-in-law has a friend in Taichung, a middle-aged man with a dark complexion and an occasional shy smile. My first impression of him wasn\u0026rsquo;t memorable until he drove away in a new BMW. The second time we met, he arrived in a Mercedes-Benz, which made me admire him. I realized that appearances can be deceiving and quickly asked him what kind of big business he was in. He said he wasn\u0026rsquo;t a businessman, just an ordinary office worker. I pressed him further, asking which big company he worked for. He said he worked at the post office. I thought he must be a senior executive to be so prestigious and own two luxury cars. The answer, however, was surprising. He replied, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a mailman. I deliver mail by motorcycle in the morning, with a monthly salary of NT$30,000-40,000.\u0026rdquo; I secretly speculated that he must specialize in delivering registered mail and was pocketing some of the contents. He then told me his story. His previous generation were poor farmers who left behind some land, which he had always regarded as ancestral property and kept without selling. No one expected that recent land consolidation would increase the value of his land by dozens of times. Now, just by renting out houses, he earns NT$500,000 in rent every month. This 48-year-old mailman didn\u0026rsquo;t rely on increasing income and reducing expenditure, but simply by putting his assets in the right place, he now has assets of more than NT$300 million. This is one of the examples of wealth accumulation through financial management in Taiwanese society.\nSimilar stories seem to happen frequently around us. Before I taught at the university, I worked for an investment company. Once, during the election of directors and supervisors at a shareholders\u0026rsquo; meeting, I discovered that a major shareholder holding more than NT$200 million worth of shares was actually a clerk in the company\u0026rsquo;s personnel department. It turned out that 35 years ago, when she joined the company as an employee, her salary was very low and her life was insecure, so she saved her meager salary. When company employees had fractional shares to transfer, she would buy them. After many years, this woman in her 50s, although unremarkable and not looking like a rich woman, now has a net worth of more than NT$200 million, enough to enjoy her retirement. In fact, there are countless examples of such ordinary office workers who have become wealthy through investment and financial management. Many people say that office workers cannot become rich, but in reality, wealthy office workers mostly don\u0026rsquo;t like to show off, so the way to get rich through investment and financial management is often overlooked.\nWhat Differentiates the Rich from the Poor?\nMany hardworking office workers who toil daily for money have had the common experience of watching rich people in expensive clothes, living in luxurious villas, and driving by in luxury cars, looking impressive and enviable. While admiring them, you may have wondered: \u0026ldquo;What makes them rich, but not me?\u0026rdquo;\nMany people attribute the wealth of these rich people directly to their being born rich, their successful entrepreneurial ventures, their being smarter, harder working, or luckier than others. However, family background, entrepreneurship, intelligence, hard work, and luck cannot explain all the reasons for wealth accumulation. We have all encountered many rich people, such as \u0026ldquo;nouveau riche\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;landowners.\u0026rdquo; They were not born into wealthy families, nor are they businessmen. They are not necessarily very smart, haven\u0026rsquo;t received much higher education, and are not more frugal than us. Some of them even idle around all day. The only thing they seem to be better at than you is that they are rich.\nWhat special skills do these rich people possess that are lacking in those office workers who diligently save money and work hard every day? How can they accumulate such enormous wealth in their lifetime? This is the question the author has been eager to explore for many years. I have tried to explain their wealth with factors such as family background, entrepreneurship, occupation, education, IQ, and effort, but all seem to have failed. After years of observation, induction, and academic research, I have discovered a very important factor that is often overlooked by most people: the ability to invest and manage finances. At the same time, I have also discovered the following three facts:\n1. One of the important factors that distinguishes the rich from the poor is: the ability to invest and manage finances.\n2. Everyone can achieve wealth through investment and financial management.\n3. The first thing to do to improve your financial situation is: to understand the basic concepts of investment and financial management. content_copy Use code with caution.\n","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005958/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: Preface","type":"posts"},{"content":" The Correct Concept of Financial Management # The key to winning the wealth race lies not in the starting point, but in choosing the right track.\nInvestment Leads to Wealth # The Chinatrust Financial Holding Co., one of the top five conglomerates in Taiwan, was led by Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Koo\u0026rsquo;s Group, and Jeffrey Koo, chairman of Chinatrust Commercial Bank. The Koo\u0026rsquo;s Group encompassed seven major business segments: finance, manufacturing, construction, hotels, media, services, and overseas operations, with over 50 affiliated companies and total assets exceeding NT$460 billion. Many wondered how this uncle-nephew duo achieved both political and business success, and who was wealthier.\nThe Wealth Race Between Koo Chen-fu and Jeffrey Koo\nWealth often correlates with personality. Koo Chen-fu was a slow and steady type, while Jeffrey Koo was more of a go-getter. Due to their vastly different personalities, their investment approaches also differed significantly. Koo Chen-fu\u0026rsquo;s eldest son, Eugene Koo, the general manager of China Life Insurance in Taiwan, understood them well. He once said, \u0026ldquo;Money put in Koo Chen-fu\u0026rsquo;s pocket would never come out, but money put in Jeffrey Koo\u0026rsquo;s pocket would disappear.\u0026rdquo; This was because Jeffrey Koo continuously reinvested his money, leading to greater wealth accumulation than his uncle. Jeffrey Koo\u0026rsquo;s personal assets were spread across the US and Japan, invested in real estate, funds, hotels, golf courses, and banks. Koo Chen-fu, in his 80s, was quite conservative. Regarding his financial management philosophy, he said, \u0026ldquo;I neglect financial management and don\u0026rsquo;t want to worry about money.\u0026rdquo; His personal income was deposited in the bank by his secretary, and aside from necessary expenses, the rest was converted into fixed-term deposits.\nOver the years, Koo Chen-fu naturally had more cash on hand, as his money remained in the bank. However, in terms of wealth creation, Jeffrey Koo far surpassed him. Despite a 17-year age difference, with proper investment, one could still come out ahead.\nInvesting $1,200 Monthly Can Make You a Billionaire in 40 Years\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not what you don\u0026rsquo;t know that gets you into trouble. It\u0026rsquo;s what you know for sure that just ain\u0026rsquo;t so.\nThe first concept to understand about investment is: Investment not only improves financial situations but also allows anyone to achieve wealth.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s illustrate with a simple example:\nSuppose a young person with no savings starts saving NT$14,000 annually for 40 years. If this money is invested in stocks or real estate with an average annual return of 20%, how much wealth will they accumulate after 40 years?\nThe author often asks this question in lectures. Most guesses range from NT$2 million to NT$8 million, with a maximum of NT$10 million. The correct answer, however, is a surprising NT$102.81 million! For a 25-year-old, saving NT$14,000 annually (equivalent to $1,200 monthly) for 40 years, with a total investment of NT$560,000, could result in becoming a billionaire by age 65, assuming a 20% annual return in stocks or real estate.\nThis figure is calculated using the future value of an annuity formula in finance and investment. The calculation is as follows:\n1.4√ó(1+0.20)40‚àí10.20=10281 (Units are in NT$10,000)\nThis formula illustrates how small amounts of money can grow significantly through investment. Understanding the formula isn\u0026rsquo;t crucial; most people who become billionaires through investment don\u0026rsquo;t know it, and knowing it doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee success.\nTherefore, with youth, ambition, investment knowledge, and three key factors‚Äîsaving NT$14,000 annually, investing in stocks or real estate, and patiently waiting for 40 years‚Äîanyone can achieve wealth through investment, regardless of their current economic situation. These three factors are attainable for everyone:\nSaving NT$14,000 annually (NT$1,200 monthly) should be manageable for most. (If you can\u0026rsquo;t save this much, focus on saving before investing. This book may not be as helpful yet, as you need some capital to start investing.)\nHistorically, the long-term average return on stocks and real estate has been above 20%. Consistently investing in these assets and holding them long-term can yield a 20% average return. These investment tools are accessible to everyone. (Data shows that the Taiwan stock market has averaged around 20% annual returns over the past 20 years; studies show similar returns for Taiwan real estate over the past 40 years.)\n40 years seems long, but it\u0026rsquo;s a timeframe most people have. Starting work between 20 and 25 and retiring at 65 provides a 40-year investment window. While some are born rich and others poor, most have a fair chance at accumulating wealth over 40 years.\nThis example shows that investment not only improves finances but also provides a path to wealth. With the right concepts and practices, anyone can achieve wealth through investment.\nSmart Investing Can Shorten the Journey by 10 Years\nWhile the initial example uses 40 years to demonstrate the power of investing, most readers are likely in a better position. They may already have savings and can save more than NT$14,000 annually, shortening their path to wealth.\nThe table below illustrates the wealth accumulation over 10-year intervals using the previous example (investing NT$14,000 annually with a 20% return):\nIf you have NT$360,000, congratulations! You\u0026rsquo;ve saved 10 years of effort. By continuing to invest in stocks or real estate, you could become a billionaire in 30 years. With NT$2.61 million, you\u0026rsquo;ve saved 20 years. With NT$16.55 million, you\u0026rsquo;re even closer, needing only 10 more years.\nInvestment Years Accumulated Amount (NT$10,000) Amount Accumulated in the Last Decade (NT$10,000) 10 36 36 20 261 225 30 1655 1394 40 10281 8626 Most readers likely have some savings, allowing them to achieve significant wealth in 20-30 years.\nInvesting Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Require Advanced Knowledge\nThe trouble with the world is not that people know too little, but that they know so many things that just aren\u0026rsquo;t so.\nMany believe investing requires perfect timing and extensive financial knowledge. This isn\u0026rsquo;t entirely true. After years of studying investment, and witnessing ordinary people achieve wealth through it, I can confidently say that investment success doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend on academic qualifications, intelligence, technical skills, or predictive abilities. It depends on doing the right things. Successful investors aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily highly educated or technically skilled; they can be ordinary people who understand fundamental principles.\nBy doing the right things, anyone can achieve wealth through investment, regardless of their background or effort. Investing doesn\u0026rsquo;t require genius or specialized knowledge; common sense and consistent action are key. Investors don\u0026rsquo;t need to rely on experts; with the right mindset, you can outperform them.\nInvesting isn\u0026rsquo;t about complex techniques; it\u0026rsquo;s about having the right mindset. Successful investors simply cultivate habits that most people find uncomfortable or difficult to maintain. Do you understand that investing can create wealth? If so, are you actively pursuing it?\nFrom another perspective, investing can be challenging. The difficulty lies not in needing advanced knowledge, but in going against ingrained habits. This is difficult for most people.\nThis book presents seemingly simple investment concepts, but wealth is built through consistent, correct habits. Start your investment journey by building the right habits!\nThe amount of money you accumulate in your lifetime depends not on how much you earn, but on how you manage it.\nSaving Alone Is Not Enough # A Taiwanese proverb says, \u0026ldquo;People have two legs, money has four.\u0026rdquo; Money chases money faster than people chase money.\nTraditional wisdom dictates that \u0026ldquo;the path to wealth lies in diligence and frugality.\u0026rdquo; This held true in times of economic stagnation, but in today\u0026rsquo;s rapidly changing economy, this mindset requires adjustment.\nA century ago, before modern economics became widespread, during periods of economic stagnation and frequent wars, saving was indeed crucial for wealth accumulation. Today, however, with global economic growth and soaring stock and real estate prices, the focus should shift from saving to leveraging the power of compound interest for exponential growth.\nHow Did Lien Chan Become Wealthy?\nWith so many assets, it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to monitor everything closely. During the period of entrusted management, the principle was to hold existing investments and not trade stocks or dispose of real estate.\nLien Chan, with an estimated net worth of nearly NT$6 billion, was one of Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s wealthiest officials. His wealth wasn\u0026rsquo;t accumulated through decades of frugal living on a government salary or through earning a doctoral degree. It stemmed from his mother\u0026rsquo;s shift in investment strategy over 40 years prior.\nAround 1951, Chang Pin-san, former chairman of Chang Hwa Bank, advised Lien Chan\u0026rsquo;s father, Lien Chen-tung, to invest in shares of the \u0026ldquo;Big Three\u0026rdquo; commercial banks. Following this advice, Lien Chan\u0026rsquo;s mother, Chao Lan-kun, invested her savings in hundreds of shares of Chang Hwa Bank, holding them long-term and letting their value appreciate naturally. This laid the foundation for the Lien family\u0026rsquo;s fortune. Chao Lan-kun had a keen financial mind. Unlike other women who participated in rotating savings and credit associations or simply deposited money in banks, she actively invested. She sold ancestral farmland in Miaoli and co-developed a property on Nanjing West Road with Huang Lie-huo, founder of Wei Chuan Foods Corporation, splitting the profits. This prime real estate became a significant source of wealth for the Lien family.\nStocks, real estate, and land were the Lien family\u0026rsquo;s wealth-generating tools. Over the years, Lien Chan accumulated holdings in 19 different stocks, including Chang Hwa Bank, Taipei Business Bank, Hua Nan Bank, and Cathay Life Insurance. His real estate holdings were located in prime areas like the Da\u0026rsquo;an, Shilin, and Zhongshan districts, including 11 plots of land and 26 properties.\nLien Chan once described his family\u0026rsquo;s investment approach as \u0026ldquo;Wu Wei Er Zhi\u0026rdquo; (doing nothing and achieving everything), meaning buying and holding long-term. By investing in stocks and real estate 40 years ago and patiently holding them, with minimal trading and benefiting from annual returns exceeding 20%, they amassed a fortune nearing NT$10 billion.\nYou might argue that the Lien family was already wealthy 40 years ago. This might be true, but the point is that while they were prominent, many families in Taiwan were wealthier back then. Today, very few families surpass the Liens in wealth. This is attributed to their early adoption of the correct investment strategy ‚Äì focusing on stocks and real estate.\nThe Key to Wealth Lies in Financial Management, Not Just Saving\nThe ability to earn money is less important than having a mind for financial management, understanding how to make money work for you.\nChinese culture values diligence and frugality. Older generations often teach younger ones that the path to wealth lies in these principles and careful budgeting. The saying \u0026ldquo;Great wealth comes from heaven, small wealth from frugality\u0026rdquo; encourages thriftiness, as it\u0026rsquo;s seen as the key to wealth. This emphasis on saving is reflected in Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s high savings rate. However, I want to convey a crucial message: while saving is important, financial management is even more so.\nIn the previous example, how much of the NT$100+ million fortune came from diligence and frugality? The answer is NT$560,000, accumulated by saving NT$14,000 annually for 40 years. This represents only 0.5% of the total. The remaining 99.5% came from investment, specifically the power of compound interest at a 20% annual return over 40 years. Which is more important, saving or investing? Therefore, lifetime wealth accumulation depends not on how much you earn, but on how you manage your money.\nIf a worker realizes in old age that their wealth primarily comes from a lifetime of hard work and saving, it\u0026rsquo;s almost certain they won\u0026rsquo;t be very wealthy. The key to wealth through investment isn\u0026rsquo;t the ability to \u0026ldquo;earn and save,\u0026rdquo; but the ability to leverage the \u0026ldquo;compounding power of money.\u0026rdquo; For most, improving their financial situation requires focusing on investment, not just saving.\nConsider this: saving NT$1 million annually without investing would take 100 years to reach NT$100 million. In contrast, investing NT$14,000 annually could make you a billionaire in 40 years. If Chao Lan-kun had only focused on saving and not investing, would the Lien family be as wealthy as they are today?\nI\u0026rsquo;m not dismissing the importance of saving, but I want to emphasize that it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t overshadow investment. Investment plays a crucial role in wealth accumulation. For successful investors, wealth comes primarily from \u0026ldquo;making money work for you,\u0026rdquo; not from earning or saving. Therefore, in addition to being diligent and frugal, learn how to invest.\nTo improve your financial situation, remember: earning is important, but managing your money is more so. A correct investment mindset and wise investment choices have a greater impact on your future financial status than your current wealth or future income. For most, the first step towards improving their finances is not to increase saving, but to understand the correct investment concepts and take action.\n1. For those who achieve wealth through investment, their fortune comes primarily from making money work for them, not from earning or saving.\n2. Less than 1% of a NT$100 million fortune comes directly from earned income.\n3. Investment is not a technique, but a mindset.\n4. The key to financial management is having money to manage, not the amount of money.\nThose who learn to invest are like having a money-printing machine.\nHow Investment Strategies Create the Wealth Gap # A study indicates that in recent years, the public has perceived a serious wealth gap in Taiwan, with a trend towards wealth polarization. Over 47% of respondents believe that \u0026ldquo;speculation in stocks or real estate\u0026rdquo; is the main cause of this widening gap, followed by \u0026ldquo;personal work ability and effort\u0026rdquo; (14%) and \u0026ldquo;family background\u0026rdquo; (11%). This suggests a common belief that the wealth gap isn\u0026rsquo;t solely due to individual effort, but also to systemic issues, luck, and unequal opportunities.\nIndeed, \u0026ldquo;stocks and real estate\u0026rdquo; are major contributors to the wealth gap, while \u0026ldquo;personal work ability and effort\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;family background\u0026rdquo; have less impact. People often attribute their poverty to external factors like systemic issues, luck, or lack of opportunity, or use negative terms like \u0026ldquo;speculation\u0026rdquo; to explain their lack of action. Wealthy individuals often accumulate their wealth through real estate or stock investments, not primarily through \u0026ldquo;speculation,\u0026rdquo; but through \u0026ldquo;holding appropriate investment assets.\u0026rdquo;\nLooking ahead, the wealth gap will likely continue to widen. Some will benefit, while others will suffer, depending on their ability to navigate the changing landscape. External factors alone don\u0026rsquo;t determine our financial situation; our investment abilities play a crucial role.\n1. Financial habits create the difference between the rich and the poor.\n2. The prerequisite for building wealth through investment is allocating assets to high-return investments like stocks or real estate.\n3. One way for the government to address the widening wealth gap is to educate the public about proper financial management.\nGreater Investment, Greater Returns\n\u0026ldquo;Thoughts change actions, actions change habits, habits change character, and character changes destiny.\u0026rdquo;\nImagine two classmates who join the same company after graduation, holding similar positions with the same salary. Both are equally frugal, saving NT$14,000 annually for investment. The difference lies in their approach: one keeps their savings in the bank, while the other invests in stocks. Both largely leave their money untouched after depositing or investing it.\nAfter 40 years, the stock investor becomes a billionaire, while the bank saver becomes a \u0026ldquo;millionaire.\u0026rdquo; While a billion represents significant wealth, \u0026ldquo;millionaire\u0026rdquo; now evokes laughter, being synonymous with \u0026ldquo;homeless\u0026rdquo; in Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s expensive housing market.\nThe \u0026ldquo;millionaire\u0026rdquo; classmate, seeing their former colleague with the same starting conditions become a billionaire, might assume foul play or lottery winnings. How could their wealth differ so drastically, with one rich and the other struggling?\nThose with less wealth often attribute the success of the wealthy to luck or illicit activities. A more positive view might be that they worked harder or were more frugal. However, they often overlook the critical factor: financial habits. The rich and poor manage their money differently: the rich hold assets like real estate and stocks, while the poor keep their money in the bank.\nTo become wealthy through investment, one must break free from conventional thinking. An adult who couldn\u0026rsquo;t ride a bicycle saw a child doing so and complained, \u0026ldquo;Only agile children can ride bikes.\u0026rdquo; The child responded, \u0026ldquo;Agility isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary,\u0026rdquo; and taught the adult to ride. The adult quickly learned but, upon parting ways, instinctively pushed the bicycle home instead of riding it. This illustrates the difficulty of breaking free from ingrained habits.\nIf financial management is the primary cause of the wealth gap, the solution lies in improving financial literacy and encouraging people to learn more about investing.\nFocusing Solely on Saving is Outdated\nIf one adheres to the principles of investment, it\u0026rsquo;s hard not to become wealthy. If one doesn\u0026rsquo;t, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to become wealthy.\nI often wonder why, after over 200 years since their ancestors arrived in Taiwan with nothing, most Taiwanese families aren\u0026rsquo;t significantly wealthy. Perhaps the problem lies in outdated family precepts that hinder wealth accumulation.\nFamily precepts are the guiding principles passed down through generations. Most families emphasize diligence, frugality, and academic excellence, believing these are the keys to success and wealth.\nMany families diligently follow these precepts, raising children who are both frugal and well-educated. However, few families achieve significant wealth through these alone. These precepts focus on earning money, not on managing it. To build generational wealth, families need to update their guiding principles. While \u0026ldquo;diligence and frugality\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;academic excellence\u0026rdquo; remain valuable, add another: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t keep money in the bank.\u0026rdquo;\nWhy retain \u0026ldquo;diligence and frugality\u0026rdquo;? While saving alone won\u0026rsquo;t lead to great wealth, it\u0026rsquo;s a virtue and a necessary foundation for investment.\nEducating the Next Generation Requires a Balanced Approach\nWhy keep \u0026ldquo;academic excellence\u0026rdquo;? Studies show a weak correlation between education and wealth. Academic success doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee financial success. Based on this, I once stopped emphasizing academics with my children, resulting in declining grades. Their teacher, puzzled, asked, \u0026ldquo;You and your wife are both highly educated, why don\u0026rsquo;t your children share this trait?\u0026rdquo; I was ashamed.\nI immediately reinstated the emphasis on academics. I realized it was partly for our own pride, but also because education can enhance social standing and job security. So, for both parents and children, academic pursuits remain important.\nHowever, for future generations to prosper, add another precept: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t keep money in the bank!\u0026rdquo; Encourage children to invest in assets like stocks and real estate, rather than leaving money in low-interest bank accounts. Otherwise, building significant wealth might take generations.\nEvery Lunar New Year, I buy stocks for my children instead of giving cash. My second-grader is already learning the importance of investing over saving. This concept should be ingrained early as part of family values, fostering a healthy financial mindset from a young age.\nIn conclusion, most family precepts are outdated. Building wealth for future generations requires new concepts and practices. By updating family values and changing how we accumulate wealth, families can achieve lasting prosperity.\n1. Diligence, frugality, and academic excellence alone are not enough for building lasting wealth.\n2. Teach children not to keep money in the bank, cultivating a proper investment mindset from a young age.\n3. Leaving money to children might sustain them for a few years; teaching them how to manage it can provide for a lifetime and for generations to come.\n","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1731056005959/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Personal Investment Bible: The Correct Concept of Financial Management","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/wealth-creation/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Wealth Creation","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/wealth-gap/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Wealth Gap","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-08","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%AE%B6%E8%AE%AD/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÂÆ∂ËÆ≠","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-08","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E5%BC%80%E6%BA%90%E8%8A%82%E6%B5%81/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÂºÄÊ∫êËäÇÊµÅ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-08","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E7%90%86%E8%B4%A2%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÁêÜË¥¢ÊïôËÇ≤","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-08","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E8%AF%BA%E8%B4%9D%E5%B0%94%E5%A5%96%E5%9F%BA%E9%87%91%E4%BC%9A/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ËØ∫Ë¥ùÂ∞îÂ•ñÂü∫Èáë‰ºö","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-11-08","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E8%B4%AB%E5%AF%8C%E5%B7%AE%E8%B7%9D/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Ë¥´ÂØåÂ∑ÆË∑ù","type":"tags"},{"content":" I. Summary # \u0026ldquo;The Intelligent Investor\u0026rdquo; is a seminal work in the field of investment, authored by Benjamin Graham, widely regarded as the \u0026ldquo;father of value investing\u0026rdquo;. The book aims to provide guidance on investment strategies for the layman, with the following core ideas:\nRational Investment: Investment decisions should be based on thorough analysis of a security\u0026rsquo;s value, not on market sentiment or speculative behavior. Margin of Safety: The core of investing is the margin of safety, which means buying securities at a price significantly below their intrinsic value, thus reducing risk and enhancing potential returns. Defensive and Enterprising Investors: Based on risk tolerance and investment objectives, investors are classified as either defensive or enterprising, each employing different investment strategies. Investors and the Market: Investors should view market fluctuations rationally, seeing them as opportunities rather than sources of risk. Company Owner Mentality: Investors should adopt the mindset of a company owner, paying attention to corporate management and governance and safeguarding their own interests. II. Chapter Summaries # Chapter 1: What Intelligent Investors Get # This chapter introduces fundamental concepts of investing, including:\nInvesting vs. Speculation: Investing is an operation based on analysis, aiming for safety of principal and a satisfactory return; speculation is hoping for profit from market fluctuations and carries higher risk. Defensive Investors: Seeking safety and steady returns, they can adopt a simple portfolio strategy, allocating funds between high-grade bonds and a diversified selection of leading common stocks. Enterprising Investors: Willing to take on more risk for greater returns, they can employ more aggressive strategies, such as selecting growth stocks and seeking undervalued securities. Chapter 2: The Investor and Market Fluctuations # This chapter explores how investors should view market fluctuations:\nPrice Fluctuations as a Measure of Investment Success: In the long run, investment success depends on the long-term returns of the portfolio, not short-term price movements. Market Fluctuations as a Guide for Investment Decisions: Investors can capitalize on market volatility to create opportunities for buying low and selling high, but should avoid excessive focus on short-term market trends. Market Fluctuations of Individual Stocks: Focusing on undervalued individual stocks is more meaningful than attempting to predict overall market movements. Chapter 3: A Review of the 1964 Market # This chapter analyzes the stock market conditions at the time of writing (1964):\nComparison with Previous Years: The stock market was at a historical high, rendering traditional valuation methods no longer applicable. New Standards for a \u0026ldquo;New Era\u0026rdquo;: New valuation methods had not yet been tested by time, and the market was characterized by a high degree of uncertainty. Investment Strategy Recommendation: Adopt a cautious investment strategy and avoid excessive risk-taking. Chapter 4: The Investor and His Advisers # This chapter discusses the relationship between investors and their advisors:\nSources of Investment Advice: Investors can obtain investment guidance from various avenues, including family and friends, banks, brokerage firms, and professional investment advisors. Selecting Investment Advisors: Choosing the right advisor is crucial, requiring careful assessment of their expertise, experience, and ethical standards. Independent Thinking: Even when seeking professional advice, investors should maintain their own independent judgment and be responsible for their investment decisions. Chapter 5: The Defensive Investor\u0026rsquo;s Portfolio Policy # This chapter details the strategies for defensive investors:\nBond and Stock Allocation: Allocate funds between high-grade bonds and a diversified selection of leading common stocks. The ratio can be adjusted based on market conditions, but generally maintain a 50:50 split. Bond Portfolio Composition: Introduces characteristics of different types of bonds, such as US Savings Bonds, state and municipal bonds, and corporate bonds. Principles for Common Stock Selection: Choose large, prominent, and conservatively financed companies with a long history of dividend payments, and purchase them at reasonable price-earnings ratios. Chapter 6: Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach # This chapter presents a \u0026ldquo;negative list\u0026rdquo; of what enterprising investors should avoid:\nSecond-Grade Bonds and Preferred Stocks: Avoid buying securities lacking sufficient safety merely for the allure of high yields. Foreign Government Bonds: Higher risk and difficulty in enforcing claims in case of default. New Issues: Require careful evaluation and avoidance of excessive hype surrounding them. Convertible Issues: Their advantages often come at the expense of quality or income, and they present investors with decision-making dilemmas. New-Issue Mania: During bull markets, many smaller companies go public, and their stock pricing is often unattractive or even excessive. Investors should be wary of the hype surrounding new issues and avoid blindly following the crowd. Chapter 7: Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side # This chapter discusses positive strategies enterprising investors can employ:\nMarket Timing Limitations: While the strategy of buying low in depressed markets and selling high in booming markets could be profitable in the past, recent market dynamics have made this approach less viable. Considerations for Growth Stocks: Selecting growth stocks requires diligent assessment of future growth potential, avoiding overpaying for lofty expectations. Three Recommended Areas for Enterprising Investment: Investing in Large Companies during Unpopular Periods: When large companies are experiencing unpopular periods, their stock prices may be undervalued, presenting opportunities for investors. Bargain Issues: Seek securities whose intrinsic value is demonstrably understated and buy them at prices significantly below this value. Special Situations: Focus on events like mergers, reorganizations, and liquidations where the price fluctuations can offer substantial profit opportunities. Broad Application of Investment Rules: Enterprising investors should approach investing as a business endeavor, adhering to sound business principles, such as knowing their investment domain, choosing partners carefully, and managing risk. Chapter 8: Security Analysis for the Lay Investor: General Approach # This chapter introduces basic methods of security analysis for non-professional investors:\nBond Analysis: Focus on the ratio of earnings to interest expenses, ensuring it meets certain standards (4x for utilities, 5x for railroads, 7x for industrials). Consider factors like company size, equity ratio, and asset value. Understand the risk characteristics of different bond types, like the relatively higher risk of railroad bonds compared to the safer utility company bonds. Common Stock Analysis: Analyze company profitability, including projected future earnings, sales margins, and return on net worth. Assess capitalization rates, considering factors like long-term prospects, management quality, financial condition, and dividend record. Pay attention to the impact of non-recurring gains and losses, making adjustments to earnings data. Industrial Stock Analysis: Focus on industry trends and individual companies\u0026rsquo; competitive positions within their respective sectors. Chapter 9: Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor # Using Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks as an example, this chapter explains how defensive investors can select securities:\nChoose a Representative Sample: For instance, buy equal amounts of all 30 Dow Jones industrial stocks. Exclude Stocks with Excessive Price-Earnings Ratios: Avoid overpaying for speculative growth. Select Relatively Unpopular Stocks with Reasonable Valuations: Capitalize on the market\u0026rsquo;s neglect of certain stocks, finding undervalued investment opportunities. Chapter 10: Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor: General Approach # This chapter introduces methods for enterprising investors to select securities:\nThe Valuation Approach: Estimate a company\u0026rsquo;s future earnings and select a suitable multiplier to determine its intrinsic value. Factors Affecting Asset Value: Pay attention to net tangible asset value, especially net current asset value. Add half the excess of net current asset value over earnings power value to the earnings power value for a more comprehensive assessment. Growth Stock Valuation: Consider the expected growth rate, but be cautious in assessing its reasonableness. The author provides a simplified formula for growth stock valuation: Value = Current (normal) earnings x (8.5 + 2 x expected annual growth rate). First-Grade vs. Second-Grade Common Stocks: Enterprising investors can consider buying second-grade common stocks, but only at bargain prices, namely when their price is less than two-thirds of the indicated intrinsic value. Chapter 11: Security Analysis for the Lay Investor: Six Illustrative Cases # This chapter uses six real-world cases to illustrate how to apply security analysis techniques to uncover undervalued investment opportunities:\nCase 1: Northern Pacific Railroad common stock (1947): The company\u0026rsquo;s stock price was undervalued due to a combination of a low dividend payout and the non-inclusion of certain earnings in its income statement. Case 2: Standard Gas and Electric (SP\u0026amp;L) $7 preferred (1947): Analyzed the complex capital structure of SP\u0026amp;L, pointing out the undervaluation of its preferred stock. Case 3: American-Hawaiian Steamship (AHS) (1947): The company held substantial cash assets that were not reflected in its market price. Case 4: Royal Dutch Petroleum (RDP) (1953): Pointed out that the market value of RDP was undervalued relative to its earnings power. Case 5: Hoover Company Class A (1957): The company\u0026rsquo;s stock was undervalued because the net worth of its British subsidiary was not fully reflected. Case 6: Chicago, Terre Haute \u0026amp; Southeastern Railway (TH) bonds (1964): Analyzed the value of TH bonds, indicating their undervaluation compared to comparable bonds. Chapter 12: Stock Market Fluctuations: The Pattern of Behavior # This chapter analyzes the patterns of earnings and price fluctuations for different types of stocks:\nPattern 1: Relatively Stable Earnings, Wide Price Fluctuations: Using S.H. Kress as an example, the chapter demonstrates how even with stable earnings, market prices can fluctuate greatly, primarily driven by market sentiment. Pattern 2: Earnings Fluctuate Moderately, Stock Prices Fluctuate Widely: Using General Motors as an example, it illustrates how stock price volatility often exceeds earnings volatility and advises investors to view such fluctuations rationally. Pattern 3: Extreme Ups and Downs: Taking examples like Brunswick Corporation and St. Louis Southwestern Railway, the chapter highlights the substantial uncertainties in company development and stock price movements. Investors should be wary of companies experiencing extreme volatility. Pattern 4: Growth Stocks: Using examples like 3M and Philip Morris, the chapter shows that even growth stocks face risks, and investors should carefully evaluate their growth potential and avoid overpaying for lofty expectations. Chapter 13: A Comparison of Eight Pairs of Companies # This chapter uses comparative analysis of various stock portfolios to further investigate factors impacting stock prices:\nFour Groups of Randomly Selected Cases and the Dow Jones Industrial Average: By contrasting the performance of stocks in different market standings and comparing their initial trading dates, the chapter suggests that choosing large, strong companies often yields more consistent results. New stocks of smaller companies carry higher risk. Secular Changes in the Quality of a Company Group: Taking railroad stocks as an example, the chapter highlights how the standing and investment merit of companies within a group can shift significantly over time. The Results of a Policy of Quality Improvement: Using the Dow Jones Industrial Average as an example, the chapter illustrates that merely replacing underperforming components with more popular ones does not necessarily lead to sustained investment gains. Stock selection should be based on a combination of company quality and price. Chapter 14: Stockholders and Management # This chapter explores the relationship between stockholders and company management:\nManagement Efficiency: How to assess Management efficiency: By comparing key indicators like profitability, sales margin, and return on net worth to industry averages. How to improve inefficient management: Stockholders can take actions like raising questions at shareholder meetings, hiring independent management consultants for assessment, and electing more independent board members. The Board of Directors: Role in Corporate Governance: The board represents shareholder interests, oversees management, sets company strategy, and reviews and approves significant decisions. Stockholder Oversight of the Board: Stockholders can exercise their influence by electing board members and voting on proposals at shareholder meetings. Fair Treatment of the General Stockholder: Management\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to protect outside stockholder interests: Management should set a fair dividend policy, avoid repurchasing stock at excessively low prices, and prioritize shareholder interests. Holding Companies: Disadvantageous position of outside stockholders within holding companies: Holding companies often present conflicts between controlling shareholder interests and those of outside stockholders, leading to potential harm to the latter. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Investor Protection: SEC\u0026rsquo;s functions and limitations: The SEC oversees the securities market and protects investor interests. However, its powers and functions are limited and cannot fully guarantee investor rights. Chapter 15: \u0026ldquo;Margin of Safety\u0026rdquo; as the Central Concept of Investment # This chapter summarizes the core concept of the book - the Margin of Safety:\nDefinition of Margin of Safety: Purchasing securities at a price significantly below their intrinsic value, thereby mitigating risk and enhancing potential returns. Application in Different Investment Types: Bonds, common stocks, growth stocks, bargain issues, and other asset classes. Margin of Safety and Diversification: Diversification can reduce the overall risk of a portfolio and therefore enhances the margin of safety. Distinguishing Investment from Speculation: The margin of safety is a key criterion for differentiating investment operations from speculative ones. Investment operations should be based on a clear and demonstrably justifiable analysis of value, while speculative operations rely more heavily on subjective judgment and market sentiment. Generalization of the Investment Concept: The idea of margin of safety can be applied to broader investment domains, such as when purchasing real estate, art, or other assets. III.

Investors need to be confident and courageous in their convictions, even when facing dissenting opinions. Stay true to your well-researched investment principles.\n\u0026ldquo;Many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: The business landscape is dynamic. Company strength and investment merit can shift over time, requiring investors to maintain a dynamic outlook and avoid fixed biases.\n\u0026ldquo;Margin of Safety\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This succinct phrase encapsulates the core of Graham\u0026rsquo;s approach. Investing should be grounded in acquiring assets at a price that provides a buffer against uncertainty and potential errors in judgment.\nIV. Guiding Significance # Establish a Sound Investment Philosophy: Investing should be based on value analysis, not on speculation. Emphasize Margin of Safety: Purchase securities at prices significantly below their intrinsic value to minimize risk and enhance potential returns. Choose a Suitable Investment Strategy: Opt for a strategy‚Äîdefensive or enterprising‚Äîthat aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives. View Market Fluctuations Rationally: Don\u0026rsquo;t be swayed by emotional reactions to market volatility. Instead, view such fluctuations as potential opportunities. Continuously Learn and Improve Investment Knowledge: Investing requires ongoing study and practice. Maintain Patience and Discipline: Investment success often requires a long-term perspective, avoiding impulsive reactions to market movements.

Main Topic # This session revolves around investment and life planning. The core ideas are: be optimistic about investment and keep learning, ignoring short-term market fluctuations; young people should focus on asset appreciation, with Nasdaq 100 index funds being the top choice; utilize leverage and allocate assets reasonably; retirees should plan carefully and avoid excessive debt; and one should stay optimistic and confident, avoid material comparisons, and pursue true freedom.\nII. Presentation Content # Investment Philosophy and Market Analysis # Market Fluctuations and Investment Mentality: The market is always fluctuating. Don\u0026rsquo;t let short-term fluctuations affect your investment decisions. Stay optimistic. Currency Devaluation and Asset Appreciation: Money depreciates; only assets like stocks can preserve and increase in value. Currency devaluation is more severe in emerging countries, so it is advised to convert currency into assets. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s low wages and currency devaluation are related to the government\u0026rsquo;s subsidy policies. Worker Mindset vs. Capitalist Mindset: Workers exchange labor for depreciating currency, while capitalists exchange currency for appreciating assets. Learn to invest and become a capitalist, exchanging \u0026ldquo;trash\u0026rdquo; (depreciating currency) for assets. Global Market Linkage: Global markets are highly interconnected, and diversifying investments into other regions has limited effectiveness. Focusing on the US stock market is recommended. Asset Allocation Strategies # Nasdaq 100 Index Funds: The preferred choice for young people. Long-term investment can yield substantial returns. Global codes for purchasing Nasdaq 100 index funds were provided, and investing based on market conditions is recommended. The Importance of Cash: Cash reserves are crucial. 00864B and money market funds (like SWVXX, VOXX) are safeguards and should not be replaced with high-dividend products like SPHD, as principal safety is paramount. Smart Rebalancing: Suitable for those who use leveraged funds, are not retired, and have income. Risks of Real Estate Investment: Housing prices in the Bay Area are high, putting great pressure on young people to buy houses, which can easily lead to financial difficulties. Renting is recommended to maintain flexibility. Borrowing and Investment: Loans, mortgages, and car loans should be repaid with stable cash flow, not relying on stock market returns. Retirement Planning: Retirees should be cautious about borrowing and make plans based on the size of their retirement funds. If retirement funds are 50 times the annual expenses, two options are available: 1. Keep the mortgage and car loan, using 2% of the retirement fund annually to cover all expenses; 2. Pay off the mortgage and car loan, invest 80% of the remaining funds in 00662, 20% in 00864B, and use 2% of the total funds annually for living expenses. Asset Allocation Case Study: A case study with 45 million Taiwan dollars illustrated asset allocation strategies when withdrawals are not needed. An 80/20 allocation or a combination of leveraged funds (60% 00662, 20% 00670L, 20% 00864B) is recommended. For those with stable income and no need to withdraw from investments, 100% investment in QQQ can be considered. Other Matters # Class Suspension Notice: Class is suspended on November 9th and resumes on November 16th. After daylight saving time ends, the class time will be changed to 6:00 AM Pacific Time and 10:00 PM Taiwan time. Stay Optimistic: Maintain an optimistic mindset; the market will reward you. Like, subscribe, and leave comments on various platforms to benefit more people. Contact Information: Two email addresses were provided for contact. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Brian: # Sharing 1: Read \u0026ldquo;Investing is Asset Allocation, What You Don\u0026rsquo;t Know,\u0026rdquo; agreeing with the importance of accumulating the first pot of gold early; learning investment allows for more focus on work and personal improvement, spending time each day learning new skills and increasing self-worth. Investment enables people to be more motivated to improve their professional skills rather than \u0026ldquo;lying flat.\u0026rdquo; Sharing 2: Individuals can improve their earning potential through learning, even if their investment assets are reduced to zero, they can still rely on professional skills to make a comeback. Question 1: What should I do if the Beta value is very low when the asset value plummets in the Excel sheet? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: The sheet is designed for acceleration during market rises and deceleration during falls. A low Beta value is normal and a reflection of risk control; no adjustment is needed. Question 2: Even knowing that investment should be mindless, I still worry when the Beta value drops. How should I cope? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Deceleration during declines is the purpose of the investment strategy. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, stick to the plan, just like autopilot. LU: # Question 1: What is the impact of Trump\u0026rsquo;s potential return to office on Bitcoin? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: The US has abandoned the gold standard and will not adopt a Bitcoin standard. Bitcoin is similar to gold and has an anti-inflationary function, but its future development is limited. Question 2: Can QQQ break through its previous high? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: It definitely can. The current market is bullish; there\u0026rsquo;s no need to worry. Wendy: # Sharing 1: Learned James\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy and successfully recouped the income lost during unemployment. Started reading recommended books such as \u0026ldquo;The Richest Man in Babylon\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The Most Important Thing.\u0026rdquo; No Questions Peter: # Sharing 1: Agrees with James\u0026rsquo;s philosophy and has increased the investment proportion of QQQ, but some individual stocks have not been completely sold due to tax reasons. Question 1: Advantages and disadvantages of converting 401K to Roth 401K? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Just put new contributions into Roth 401K; don\u0026rsquo;t convert existing funds. Convert at retirement. Question 2: How to use HSA and 529 accounts? Is there any problem with using a credit card to pay medical bills from an HSA? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: HSA, 529, and college fund accounts are not recommended because they lead to a loss of control over the funds. Using your own funds or loans is recommended. Question 3: Are there any suggestions for increasing income and saving money besides a full-time job? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Excessive saving is not recommended. Plan for retirement funds first, and the remaining money can be freely used and enjoyed. Yi Jie (First Sister): # Sharing 1: Previously followed the advice of online influencers and invested in US stocks and treasury bonds, currently converting to QQQ. Has a modest salary and one child. Question 1: Can the 20% cash in the 80/20 allocation be replaced with Fubon 50 2X leverage? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: QQQ 2X leverage (00670L) is recommended. He explained the use of leveraged funds. Question 2: Is it feasible to regularly invest equal amounts in QQQ and 2X leverage? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Feasible, but pay attention to cash reserves. A Beta of 1.1 or 1.2 allocation is recommended, adjusting according to market conditions. Question 3: Can a child\u0026rsquo;s Lunar New Year money be all-in on 2X leverage? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: If you can guarantee continuous regular investment for more than 30 years, it\u0026rsquo;s worth considering, but be aware of the risks and be able to withstand significant asset shrinkage. In the long run, the returns can be substantial, but psychological barriers must be overcome. Question 4: Are the views of online influencers recommending treasury bonds correct? Are treasury bonds more valuable during a market crash? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Incorrect. During market downturns, bond declines can be even greater. IAM: # Sharing 1: Reflecting on the value of money, learning gratitude, and paying attention to community articles, realizing that spending money is spending one\u0026rsquo;s life energy. Sharing 2: Made 100 pages of notes and calculated the return on an 80,000 loan invested for 40 years; the result was shocking. Question 1: Why are people not accustomed to borrowing for investment? Confused about the phenomenon of young people being afraid to borrow for investment but willing to use installment plans for consumption. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: This is due to cultural influences. Change your mindset and recognize that good debt can help accumulate wealth. Shared personal experiences and spending philosophy, emphasizing the freedom of spending after becoming wealthy. YJ Yuanlin: # Sharing 1: Investing boosts confidence, enabling focus on work and hobbies. Question 1: In a down year, can TQQ replace QLD in smart rebalancing? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Both are possible, but pay attention to risk control and avoid excessive pursuit of high risk. TQQ has greater volatility and requires a stronger psychological capacity. T: # Question 1: What are your thoughts on Elon Musk supporting Trump? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Politicians\u0026rsquo; decisions are the result of weighing pros and cons. Elon Musk\u0026rsquo;s support for Trump stems from personal interests and positions, such as opposing certain liberal policies. Entrepreneurs also have to choose between different political forces. Yi Ni: # Question 1: How to invest and use Canadian education fund accounts? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to thoroughly research the specific rules of the account and consider methods like pledged loans to avoid locking up funds. Inquired about whether it\u0026rsquo;s possible to withdraw all funds and the limitations, suggesting consulting with professionals. Meng: # Sharing 1: In the high-tech era, privacy and freedom are difficult to have both. Peter: # Sharing 1: It can be difficult for beginners to invest in QQQ, etc. It\u0026rsquo;s suggested to start by buying one share and gradually build confidence. James\u0026rsquo;s explanations are very patient and benefit everyone. Question 1: How to strengthen mental and psychological well-being? James\u0026rsquo;s experience sharing on meditation and hypnosis. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Recommended Rachel\u0026rsquo;s hypnosis channel and shared personal methods of using hypnosis and positive psychological suggestions. Suggested listening to hypnotic audios every night before sleep. IV. Key Takeaways # Rise faster, fall slower. \u0026ndash; James\nThis is one of James\u0026rsquo;s core investment philosophies. Through smart rebalancing strategies, increase investment during market rises to accelerate profits, and reduce investment during market downturns to mitigate losses.\nMoney is the least valuable thing when it has no value. \u0026ndash; James\nThis reflects James\u0026rsquo;s unique view on wealth. When wealth accumulates to a certain extent, the value of money itself is no longer important; what matters more is pursuing freedom and happiness.\nIf you want freedom, and you want privacy, you will not have freedom. In the future world, if you want privacy, you will not have freedom. \u0026ndash; James\nThis shows James\u0026rsquo;s insight into future social trends. In the high-tech era, one needs to make trade-offs between privacy and freedom.\nThe more daring one is to borrow money, the broader their perspective. \u0026ndash; YJ Yuanlin\nYJ Yuanlin\u0026rsquo;s sharing led to James\u0026rsquo;s views on borrowing: good debt can help wealth growth.\nIf you want freedom, you cannot care. \u0026ndash; James\nEchoing the topic of Elon Musk supporting Trump and the entrepreneurial spirit, true freedom is not caring about external opinions and focusing on one\u0026rsquo;s goals.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t use ChatGPT now, you are outdated and will be eliminated. \u0026ndash; James\nJames advocates for new technologies and maintains an open attitude towards learning new things.\nV. Summary # This session covered various aspects of investment philosophy, asset allocation, lifestyle, and how to cope with market fluctuations. James answered the audience\u0026rsquo;s questions with easy-to-understand language and rich examples, sharing his life experiences and insights, and encouraging everyone to stay optimistic, continue learning, and pursue true freedom and happiness.\nDisclaimer: This article is for personal learning notes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Topic of the Day # The session focuses on the impending new highs anticipated in the investment market. James encourages everyone to bolster their investment confidence and enter the market early. He elaborates on various asset allocation strategies, particularly the use of leveraged funds and the significance of cash reserves. Additionally, James dives into the nature of US dollar hegemony and its implications for the global economy. He also shares his thoughts on marriage and childbearing.\nII. Briefing Content # The Market is About to Hit New Highs:\nThe market is on the verge of reaching new highs. Entering early is more advantageous than waiting for the new highs to materialize. Earnings reports from AI and high-tech sectors are projected to surpass expectations. Market funds and corporate profits are also expected to exceed projections. The market consistently trends upward. Investment requires patience; wealth is worth the wait. Interpreting the Asset Portfolio Research Paper:\nLong-term bonds carry higher risks than stocks while yielding lower returns. Investment in them is not recommended. QQQ offers superior returns and risk resistance compared to SPY. Leveraged funds (e.g., QQQ2D) are characterized by high volatility, substantial downside risk, but also significant upside potential. Intelligent asset allocation can achieve returns equivalent to a 100% QQQ portfolio while providing greater cash security. Retirees or individuals without income are advised against using leveraged funds. An 80/20 asset allocation strategy is recommended. Cash is the cornerstone ensuring investors can continue investing. Additional Investment Advice and Experience Sharing:\nRetirees should claim their social security benefits as early as possible and utilize them for investments. Real estate is a liability; selling property for investment purposes is recommended. Avoiding mortgage loans against real estate is advised. Young individuals can leverage credit loans for investments, accelerating wealth accumulation. Exercise prudence in investments. Avoid excessive diversification or venturing into unfamiliar domains such as real estate or REITs. Investing in individual stocks is not advised. Opt for market capitalization-based index funds like QQQ. Experiencing substantial losses is a prerequisite to appreciating the allure of high returns. The market always presents risks, and one must learn to navigate them. Short-term safe assets (e.g., treasury bills) are essential components of an investment portfolio, aiding investors in weathering market fluctuations. The higher the proportion of cash or cash-equivalent assets, the greater the risk tolerance of the investment portfolio. Refrain from self-managing stock portfolios. The returns from most stocks fall short of those from treasury bills. Stock index funds constantly face future risks. Embrace risk tolerance; only by weathering the storms can one see the sunshine. Don\u0026rsquo;t put faith in market predictions. During market downturns, \u0026ldquo;stock gurus\u0026rdquo; often emerge, but their predictions are frequently inaccurate. Adhere to long-term investment principles. Avoid being swayed by short-term market fluctuations. Marriage and Childbearing:\nMarriage serves the purpose of creating life to carry on the universe\u0026rsquo;s legacy. Loving one\u0026rsquo;s partner as one would love their own child is paramount to a successful marriage. Childbearing lies at the heart of life\u0026rsquo;s meaning. Young individuals should marry and have children early, unburdened by financial pressures. Even without marriage, childbearing should be considered. A life spent single and childless will ultimately lead to profound loneliness. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Mike:\nSharing: Mentions the Chinese government\u0026rsquo;s strong push for policies akin to MMT (Modern Monetary Theory). Question 1: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is not included in the Nasdaq 100 index, and the NYSE has extended its trading hours to 22 hours, while Nasdaq hasn\u0026rsquo;t followed suit. Why? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Nasdaq\u0026rsquo;s trading hours are already standard. Extending trading hours only affects after-hours trading, holding little significance for ordinary investors. TSMC\u0026rsquo;s exclusion from the Nasdaq 100 index is linked to factors such as trading costs. Question 2: How can MMT be explained to someone without financial expertise? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: James uses simple language to elucidate the relationship between government deficits and currency issuance. He asserts that governments can cover deficits by printing money without facing national bankruptcy. Using early American history and ancient barter systems as examples, he illustrates how governments utilize currency issuance to purchase goods and services, and how taxation maintains currency value. James emphasizes the essence of US dollar hegemony, highlighting that the US leverages its control over vital resource trading, like oil, to sustain the dollar\u0026rsquo;s global dominance, citing Russia\u0026rsquo;s forced use of dollars for oil purchases as an example. He also points out that the core nature of fiat currency is a representation of national sovereignty, enabling governments to mandate its use through legal means. IAM:\nSharing: Questions whether investing in QQQ also implies supporting \u0026ldquo;rogue\u0026rdquo; entities. After comparing returns from QQQ and its top ten constituent stocks, IAM observed higher returns from the latter, leading to confusion about the role of the remaining 90 companies. Question 1: Does investing in QQQ equate to supporting \u0026ldquo;rogue\u0026rdquo; entities? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: We, as investors, are contributors. Through our investment in QQQ, we allocate capital to the 100 companies making the most significant contributions to humanity, propelling societal progress. Question 2: The top ten constituent stocks of QQQ generate higher returns; what is the purpose of the other 90 companies? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The composition of QQQ\u0026rsquo;s top ten holdings changes annually. Examining solely the past decade\u0026rsquo;s data is insufficient. Companies previously ranked lower have the potential to enter the top ten, underscoring the vital role played by the remaining 90 companies. Question 3: Are companies ranked lower in QQQ\u0026rsquo;s constituents at risk of being removed due to a decrease in their market capitalization percentage? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Typically not, but QQQ mandates that the percentage of any individual constituent stock cannot exceed a specific threshold. Adjustments are made if this limit is surpassed. Question 4: How can one view the complete list of QQQ\u0026rsquo;s constituent companies? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This information can be accessed on websites like Yahoo Finance, which displays QQQ\u0026rsquo;s holdings, or on QQQ\u0026rsquo;s official website. Chunxia:\nSharing: Shares a friend\u0026rsquo;s investment story. This friend works at Apple and previously held steadfast belief in real estate and cash investments. However, recent issues like property taxes have awakened them to the importance of QQQ. Concerns about Apple stock\u0026rsquo;s risk have led them to hesitate about stock pledges. Question: This friend holds a large quantity of Apple stock. How can they convert it into QQQ, and how should they approach a stock pledge? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The maximum long-term capital gains tax is 20%, regardless of income. James recommends that this friend sell a portion of their Apple stock sooner rather than later, converting it into QQQ to mitigate individual stock risk and reduce future tax burdens. A gradual sale of Apple stock is advised, such as selling 10% or 20% each year or only selling the appreciated portion to minimize tax liability. A stock pledge can be utilized for tax payments, for instance, borrowing 20% for tax obligations while reinvesting the remaining funds to enhance investment efficiency. James suggests experimenting with a stock pledge, such as borrowing 2% for personal use, to gain firsthand experience with the convenience of borrowing. He emphasizes the critical role of cash. A higher proportion of cash or cash-equivalent assets translates to greater risk tolerance for the investment portfolio. Jenny:\nSharing: Owns multiple properties but has refrained from selling due to tax deductions and rising rental income. Question 1: Should she sell her properties? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Real estate investments lack the return and liquidity offered by QQQ and potentially face substantial inheritance taxes in the future. Selling the properties is advised. Property taxes, maintenance costs, insurance fees, and more erode the returns from real estate investments. Moreover, real estate is illiquid, requiring time for liquidation. Properties, as inheritance, subject heirs to hefty inheritance taxes, potentially creating an insurmountable financial burden. Question 2: How can she convert to a Roth IRA? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: A Backdoor Roth IRA conversion is an option, involving initially depositing funds into a Traditional IRA and subsequently converting them to a Roth IRA. Question 3: Can property tax deductions and rising rental income offset the costs associated with real estate investment? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The deductible amount for property taxes is limited. Moreover, income from rent increases is subject to income tax and cannot fully offset the costs tied to real estate investment. Question 4: Concerns about mortgages and trusts. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: If a mortgage is obtained under an individual\u0026rsquo;s name, even placing the property within a trust cannot circumvent inheritance taxes. Using an LLC (Limited Liability Company) for property purchase from the outset is recommended, or transferring the property into an irrevocable trust before death to avoid inheritance tax liabilities. Professor Zhou:\nSharing: Shares personal and sibling investment experiences. His sister, after experiencing investment losses, is hesitant to redeem her insurance policy. Jenny, due to returns from real estate investment, is reluctant to sell her properties. This illustrates how investors often fall prey to sunk cost and opportunity cost fallacies. Question: How can we enlighten ourselves and those around us to avoid such investment pitfalls? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Understanding the concepts of sunk cost and opportunity cost is essential. Losses from investments should be cut promptly, avoiding attachment to past investments. Seek superior investment opportunities. While Jenny\u0026rsquo;s real estate investment generates cash flow, its return is low, and it may face high inheritance taxes in the future. Therefore, she should consider selling the property and investing in higher-yielding assets like QQQ. Bart:\nQuestion: Issues connecting to the room. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Recommends force-quitting the app and re-entering the room before raising a hand. Daisy253:\nSharing: New to financial management, past investments were haphazard, primarily focused on real estate and insurance. 45 years old, with an 18-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son, can invest NT$80,000 monthly. NT$10,000 is allocated to children\u0026rsquo;s savings, with the remaining NT$70,000 for personal investment, aiming for rapid asset accumulation to reach NT$10 million. Owns a rental property generating NT$30,000-40,000 in net monthly income, with principal invested ranging from NT$2 to 3 million, and the property valued at NT$3 to 4 million. Children lean towards a \u0026ldquo;non-marriage\u0026rdquo; ideology, expressing no desire for offspring. Question: How should assets be allocated, and how can children be guided towards sound financial management principles? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Suggests referencing the article James provided, titled \u0026ldquo;Individuals Still Some Time Away from Retirement,\u0026rdquo; and adopting a BETA 1.2 asset allocation strategy. Advises against giving children excessive funds at present. Instead, encourage them to save independently once they have a stable income, guiding them to establish proper financial management habits. Proposes incentivizing children to marry and have children by offering NT$1 million annually in the future. Emphasizes that 00864B cannot be replaced by 0056. Cash is cash and should not be substituted with stocks. Underscores the significance of marriage and childbearing, advising early marriage and parenthood, urging them not to be bound by financial anxieties. Xie Weiya:\nSharing: Recounts the story of a friend working at Apple. This friend steadfastly believed in real estate and cash as investments but recently recognized the importance of QQQ due to concerns like property taxes. However, they remain apprehensive about the risks associated with Apple stock and hesitate to engage in stock pledges. This friend maintains a high spending level but undoubtedly possesses the financial capacity for retirement. They simply derive great enjoyment from work. The friend has already contacted Lisa and is preparing for a stock pledge. Question: This friend holds a substantial amount of Apple stock. How can they convert it into QQQ, and how should they approach a stock pledge? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The maximum long-term capital gains tax is 20%, independent of income. James recommends selling a portion of their Apple stock as soon as possible, converting it to QQQ to mitigate individual stock risk and reduce future tax burdens. A gradual sale of Apple stock is advised, such as 10% or 20% each year, or selling only the appreciated portion to minimize tax liability. Utilizing a stock pledge for tax payments is suggested, such as borrowing 20% for tax obligations while reinvesting the remaining funds to enhance investment efficiency. James encourages them to experiment with a stock pledge, perhaps borrowing 2% for personal use, to experience the convenience of borrowing firsthand. He highlights the vital role of cash. A higher proportion of cash or cash-equivalent assets translates to greater risk tolerance for the investment portfolio. James advises this friend to learn from investment approaches employed by individuals like Warren Buffett and Wei Ying-ch‚Äôung, leveraging credit for investment purposes. Sunny:\nQuestion: How should labor pension funds be withdrawn? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: If proficient in investment, withdrawing the entire labor pension fund at once and investing it in high-yielding assets like QQQ is recommended. Wu Liyun:\nQuestion: Is NT$5 million in stocks and cash sufficient for retirement? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: NT$5 million in assets is insufficient to support a comfortable retirement. Withdrawing a labor pension monthly to supplement retirement income is recommended. Nana:\nQuestion: Concerns regarding genetic screening. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Genetic screening is recommended to identify any potential genetic defects. College Student:\nQuestion: Concerns about Backdoor Roth IRA. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: College students, lacking income, do not require a Backdoor Roth IRA. Directly depositing funds into a Roth IRA is suitable. Jessie:\nSharing: Has 1099 income. Question: Can 1099 income be deposited into a Traditional IRA? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Yes, 1099 income is eligible for deposit into a Traditional IRA. Additionally, a Backdoor Roth IRA can be executed using a spouse\u0026rsquo;s W2 income. IV. Key Takeaways # Young individuals should be bold in using borrowed funds for investment to accelerate wealth accumulation. \u0026ndash; James\nYoung people are in their prime earning years, with steadily increasing income. They can utilize tools like credit loans to access low-cost capital for investing in high-return assets like QQQ, thereby speeding up their wealth-building journey.\nCash is the cornerstone ensuring investors can continue investing. \u0026ndash; James\nMarket volatility is a constant. Maintaining sufficient cash or cash-equivalent assets helps investors navigate market fluctuations with ease, preventing panic-driven asset sales, ultimately achieving long-term investment objectives.\nExercise prudence in investments. Avoid excessive diversification or venturing into unfamiliar domains. \u0026ndash; James\nFocus investments within familiar areas. Refrain from blindly pursuing diversification or investing in unfamiliar domains, such as real estate or REITs.\nThe essence of US dollar hegemony lies in the US leveraging its control over vital resource trading, like oil, to sustain the dollar\u0026rsquo;s global dominance. \u0026ndash; James\nBy mandating US dollar settlements for global oil transactions, the US compels other nations to hold dollar reserves, solidifying its global currency dominance.\nMarriage serves the purpose of creating life to carry on the universe\u0026rsquo;s legacy. Loving one\u0026rsquo;s partner as one would love their own child is paramount to a successful marriage. \u0026ndash; James\nThe significance of marriage lies in procreation and the continuation of life. Loving one\u0026rsquo;s partner deeply, treating them as one would treat their own child, is crucial for a lasting and fulfilling marriage.\nChildbearing lies at the heart of life\u0026rsquo;s meaning. Young individuals should marry and have children early, unburdened by financial pressures. \u0026ndash; James\nChildbearing is inherent to human nature and the perpetuation of life. Young people should courageously embrace the responsibility of parenthood, refusing to be deterred by financial concerns.\nInvestors often fall prey to sunk cost and opportunity cost fallacies. \u0026ndash; Professor Zhou\nSunk costs refer to incurred expenses that are irretrievable, such as purchased stocks or real estate. Opportunity cost represents the potential gains foregone by choosing one investment over other available options. During decision-making, investors should not be swayed by sunk costs; instead, they should prioritize opportunity cost, selecting investments offering higher returns.\nV. Conclusion # This session revolves around the anticipated new highs in the investment market. James encourages listeners to solidify their investment confidence and enter the market promptly. He meticulously explains various asset allocation strategies, emphasizing the use of leveraged funds and the paramount importance of cash reserves. He also delves into the nature of US dollar hegemony and its global economic implications, sharing his personal views on marriage and childbearing. The Q\u0026amp;A segment addresses questions encompassing asset allocation, stock pledges, retirement planning, investment strategies, and more, making it a content-rich and insightful session.\nDisclaimer: This article is for personal learning purposes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Topic # Trust in the power of technology and maintain a long-term investment strategy focused on Nasdaq 100 index funds, learning how to utilize stock pledging and spend wisely, especially during market fluctuations and shifts in the international situation.\nII. Presentation Content # Market Trends and Investment Philosophy: AI Drives the Future: AI demand is not a bubble, but a genuine driving force behind technological advancement, promising a bull market spanning two decades. We are currently in the early stages of this growth. Morris Chang (TSMC Chairman)\u0026rsquo;s perspective and TSMC\u0026rsquo;s investments in AI corroborate this judgment. The long bull market has begun, seize the opportunity to join the wealth train. Market Volatility and Long-Term Investment: Market fluctuations are inherent to investing. Downswings are followed by even greater upswings. Using historical data from the Taiwan Weighted Index, Nikkei Index, and the US stock market as examples, the session illustrates the long-term market development pattern: an initial period of rapid growth followed by a period of stagnation (e.g., 32 years in Taiwan, 35 years in Japan, 24 years in the US), before entering a phase of stable growth. Therefore, overcoming panic caused by market volatility and adhering to a long-term investment strategy is crucial for ultimate success. Capitalism and Investment: The side effects of capitalism are wealth disparity and the exploitation of labor. Learn to operate like a capitalist and profit from investment. Hard work and saving money to buy government bonds will ultimately result in wealth erosion due to inflation. Benefits of Quantitative Easing: Quantitative easing is beneficial for investors, fostering a low-interest-rate environment and driving asset price appreciation. Those who fail to understand quantitative easing and complain about government money printing are often victims of capitalism, missing out on the benefits of asset appreciation. Characteristics of a Mature Market: Mature markets are characterized by fair, just, and transparent regulatory mechanisms, companies focused on their core businesses, and a high proportion of long-term investors and institutional holdings. The Taiwanese market is gradually maturing. Investment Strategies and Recommendations: Invest in Nasdaq 100: The session recommends investing in Nasdaq 100 index funds (QQQ), with the option to allocate to S\u0026amp;P 500 or high-dividend ETFs based on individual circumstances. References to Nasdaq 100 index funds globally are provided for the convenience of investors worldwide. Avoid Penny Stocks: Refrain from investing in penny stocks, as they generally offer low long-term returns. Real investment opportunities lie in companies that demonstrate sustained growth and lead technological advancements. Advantages of Stock Pledging: Stock pledging offers advantages over real estate mortgages, as stocks, unlike real estate, do not depreciate and can be held long-term, potentially allowing for \u0026ldquo;borrowing without repayment or interest\u0026rdquo; (specific instructions are available in related videos). Avoid Flawed Rebalancing Strategies: Avoid a 50% principal + 50% leveraged ETF rebalancing strategy, as it carries high risk and can easily deplete cash reserves during market downturns. Estate Planning and Stock Pledging: When engaging in stock pledging, it is advisable to diversify assets across multiple brokerage firms, pledging a portion and keeping the rest as cash to facilitate estate handling for inheritors. Cat supplemented this with a detailed explanation of the stock pledging inheritance process, emphasizing the importance of advance planning. Other Important Matters: Risk Warning and Disclaimer: The content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. Do not remit funds to unknown accounts. Program Format Adjustment: The presentation content will be expanded to include material previously covered in short videos. QQQ Stock Selection Mechanism: Addresses audience questions regarding the QQQ stock selection mechanism, explaining the advantages of the Nasdaq exchange and why technology companies prefer listing on Nasdaq. Stock Pledging for Non-US Residents: Explains the regulations for non-US residents engaging in stock pledging with US brokers. Learning to Spend: Shares the philosophy of spending after achieving investment success, emphasizing the importance of focusing on future wealth growth and utilizing financial leverage for consumption. Don\u0026rsquo;t let wealth sit idle; learn how to use it. This point is illustrated with the example of a listener who has $4 million but doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how to spend it, calculating their potential wealth growth over 40 years and a reasonable spending level. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IAM:\nShared: Expressed confusion about different types of economic crises and how the 2020-2023 pandemic period compares to previous bubbles after reading a book about economic crises. Question 1: Which historical economic crisis is most similar to the economic downturn during the 2020-2023 pandemic? Answer: The 2020-2023 pandemic was an economic shock caused by an external event, distinct from previous bubble economies. The 2000 dot-com bubble was an industry bubble with limited impact; the 2008 financial crisis resembled the 1929 Great Depression, both being asset bubble bursts, but the 2008 crisis recovered faster due to quantitative easing. The 2022 market decline was not a bubble burst, but a revaluation caused by central bank interest rate hikes. Question 2: What did the US do to stimulate the economy that other countries couldn\u0026rsquo;t replicate? Answer: The US is less constrained by fiscal discipline and is willing to borrow and issue debt, allocating funds to social welfare programs for the elderly, children, and healthcare, while guiding domestic capital towards overseas investment to mitigate inflation. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s government was advised to learn from the US\u0026rsquo;s fiscal spending approach and guide capital towards investment, while also focusing on efficient capital utilization and building a social safety net. Question 3: Why are Chinese people so keen on buying houses? Answer: This is a vestige of the agrarian \u0026ldquo;land is wealth\u0026rdquo; mentality, which is no longer applicable today. Eason (Doctor):\nShared: Points to consider for Chinese investors buying Nasdaq ETFs: Different brokerage firms have different fee policies and financing rates; careful comparison is necessary. Domestic Nasdaq ETFs have premiums; buying during periods of low or negative premiums is recommended. There are no limits for buying ETFs on the exchange, but there are limits for off-exchange subscriptions. Recommends allocating a portion of assets to USD-denominated investments like QQQ, which can be purchased by opening brokerage accounts in Singapore or Hong Kong. Added: Chinese residents have a $50,000 annual foreign exchange quota for overseas investments. Hong Kong and mainland China identities have different withholding tax rates on US stock investments. Dave:\nQuestion 1: Will the Nasdaq 100 index become stagnant like the Dow Jones index? Answer: Currently, the Nasdaq 100 is the most competitive; excessive worry about the future is unnecessary. Question 2: Is it feasible to only buy the top 10 companies in the Nasdaq 100 index? Answer: The top ten companies change frequently; individual stock selection and portfolio adjustments are too cumbersome, and returns may not be higher. Investing directly in index funds is more efficient. Question 3: How do VGT and XLK compare to QQQ? Answer: VGT and XLK track different indices than QQQ, with different constituent stocks and concentration. QQQ is more robust and has broader coverage. Jiawen:\nQuestion: Can an 80% leveraged ETF + 10% cash + 10% bond portfolio be directly pledged? How is this done? Answer: Yes, but a small-scale trial is recommended, for instance, borrowing $200,000 against $5 million in principal, or borrowing within $1 million against $10 million. Long-term borrowing strategies should be adjusted according to circumstances. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to pledge only a portion of the stocks, leaving the remainder for additional purchases or other uses. Peter:\nShared: Personal investment journey, transitioning from real estate to stocks, learning about stock pledging and asset allocation. Question: Is there synergy between real estate and stock investment? How can real estate cash flow be used for stock investment? Answer: Buying a house is not recommended for young people. Real estate investment returns are lower than stocks and come with various risks (e.g., natural disasters, property taxes). Even with positive cash flow, opportunity costs should be considered; investing that capital in stocks might yield higher returns. Used Texas real estate as an example to illustrate the drawbacks of real estate investment. Qiu Xiao:\nQuestion 1: What are the Canadian equivalents of US retirement accounts like IRA, Roth IRA, and 401k? Which account should cash be held in? Answer: Roth IRA corresponds to Canada\u0026rsquo;s TFSA, Traditional IRA to RRSP, and 401k to DCPP. The choice of retirement account for cash depends on the individual\u0026rsquo;s balance between taxable and tax-free accounts and their asset allocation strategy. One should choose to place cash in either a tax-free or taxable account based on their specific circumstances for tax optimization. Question 2 (Related to Eason\u0026rsquo;s question): How can one invest in Nasdaq ETFs in China, and how can quota limitations be addressed? Answer: Off-exchange subscriptions have quota limits, while on-exchange ETF purchases do not, but premiums should be considered. Opening multiple brokerage accounts or opening an account in Hong Kong for US stock investment can be considered. Haoqing:\nShared: Used the example of SpaceX launching rockets with a small team to highlight concerns about AI replacing human labor and the difficulties young people face in finding employment. Question: How can we address the challenge of youth unemployment in the AI era? Answer: Young people need to acquire AI skills to adapt to the future job market. Recommends that schools incorporate AI courses into their core curriculum, cultivating AI talent from a young age. Philosophy is an important foundational subject but should not be a primary career focus. Jimmy:\nShared: Discussed the changing times and the need for young people to adapt, sharing observations about the youthful demographics of Xiamen. Mentioned the importance of aligning investments with the times and shared some common misunderstandings about investing he had encountered. Question: What are your views on index fund investing? Is the long-term return of 0050 sufficient? What are your thoughts on individual stock investing (e.g., TSMC)? Answer: Index fund investing is a method accessible to the general public, but many don\u0026rsquo;t understand it and require time and experience to appreciate it. In the long run, QQQ and SPY offer higher returns and are more suitable for long-term investment. Individual stock picking demands specialized knowledge and skills and carries higher risks; it is difficult for average investors to select and hold high-quality stocks like TSMC for the long term. The key to investing is finding investment targets that can be held long-term and sticking with them. Other Q\u0026amp;A:\nTQQQ Pledging: Learn about stock pledging and how to achieve interest-free borrowing through the recommended videos. Top 10 QQQ Holdings: Frequent trading is discouraged; holding the index fund long-term is sufficient. BOX vs. SWVXX: BOX is recommended for brokerage accounts to avoid dividend taxes. Conservative Investing: Conservative investing can involve holding cash or holding index funds long-term. How to Spend Money: Focus on future wealth growth and utilize financial leverage for consumption. Investing in US Stocks from within China: Coming to the US to invest or remitting funds to the US for investment is recommended. Consider opening an account in Hong Kong or using other compliant channels for investment. IV.

Summary # The core idea of this book is how to achieve investment returns that surpass the market average. The author argues that achieving this goal requires \u0026ldquo;second-level thinking,\u0026rdquo; which is deeper and more comprehensive than the thinking of ordinary investors. He emphasizes contrarian investing, being greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy. The book elaborates on important concepts such as market efficiency, value assessment, risk identification and control, cyclical and pendulum awareness, investor psychology, and diversified investment. It also provides a wealth of practical experience and case studies, aiming to help investors establish a sound thinking framework and control the impact of emotions on investment decisions.\nII. Chapter Summaries # Second-Level Thinking: To outperform the market, one must engage in second-level thinking, which requires investors to think more deeply and comprehensively, not being satisfied with simple conclusions, but considering various possibilities, probabilities, market consensus, and their own cognitive biases. For example, first-level thinking might conclude, \u0026ldquo;This is a good company, so I should buy it,\u0026rdquo; while second-level thinking would consider, \u0026ldquo;While it\u0026rsquo;s a good company, has the market already overreacted, pushing the price too high?\u0026rdquo;\nUnderstanding Market Efficiency and Its Limitations: Markets are not perfectly efficient; there are opportunities for mispricing. However, due to the large number of investors competing, beating the market remains very difficult. Markets are efficient at incorporating information, but they don\u0026rsquo;t always interpret that information correctly. Investors should focus on relatively inefficient markets, such as those that are less followed, have opaque information, or are controversial.\nValue Assessment: The foundation of value investing is accurate estimation of intrinsic value, which requires considering factors such as a company\u0026rsquo;s financial position, management capabilities, profitability, competitive advantages, and future growth prospects. The author emphasizes that value investing focuses more on present value, while growth investing emphasizes future value, but both require considering the future.\nThe Relationship Between Price and Value: Successful investing is not about \u0026ldquo;buying good things,\u0026rdquo; but about \u0026ldquo;buying things well,\u0026rdquo; which means buying at a price below intrinsic value. Price is influenced by value, psychology, and technical factors. Investors need to understand the relationship between these three to make sound investment decisions. Buying a good company at a high price can still lead to losses, while buying a lower-quality asset at a low price can yield high returns.\nUnderstanding Risk: Risk is not volatility, but the possibility of permanent loss of capital. It\u0026rsquo;s crucial to understand the various forms of risk, such as failing to meet objectives, underperformance, career risk, and liquidity risk. Risk is subjective and difficult to quantify, depending on the investor\u0026rsquo;s specific circumstances and goals.\nRecognizing Risk: Risk often increases when market optimism is high and prices are inflated. Be wary of the \u0026ldquo;no risk\u0026rdquo; narrative and recognize signs of an overheated market, such as high P/E ratios, narrow credit spreads, and loose credit conditions.\nControlling Risk: Risk control is more important than taking risks. Control risk through diversification, limiting risk exposure, adhering to a margin of safety, and avoiding excessive leverage. The results of risk control are often invisible because they manifest in losses avoided.\nFocusing on Cycles: Everything is cyclical. Recognize the inevitability of cyclical fluctuations and look for opportunities at cyclical extremes. The author uses the credit cycle as an example to illustrate how cycles are self-correcting and how investors can find opportunities within them.\nPendulum Awareness: Investor psychology swings like a pendulum between optimism and pessimism, greed and fear. Recognize the patterns of this swing and act contrarianly at extremes. Market extremes often represent turning points and opportunities.\nResisting Negative Influences: Resist the influence of negative emotions such as greed, fear, herd mentality, envy, and ego on investment decisions. Recognizing the existence of these psychological factors and striving to overcome them is crucial for making rational investment decisions.\nContrarian Investing: Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy. Contrarian investing is not simply doing the opposite of the crowd; it requires independent thinking and judgment, as well as a deep understanding of value. Contrarian investing can be lonely and unsettling but is key to achieving superior returns.\nFinding Bargains: Bargains often appear in unpopular and unfavored assets, such as those with apparent flaws, misunderstood by the market, or overlooked.\nWaiting Patiently for Opportunities: Don\u0026rsquo;t chase opportunities; wait patiently for them to come to you. Investors should be like baseball hitters, waiting for the perfect pitch instead of swinging blindly.\nRecognizing the Limitations of Forecasting: Predicting the future is very difficult. Recognize the limitations of forecasting and focus on knowable factors, such as company fundamentals and industry trends.\nUnderstanding Your Position in the Cycle: Understand your position within the market cycle and adjust your investment strategy accordingly. Investors can assess market conditions by observing investor behavior, the credit environment, and valuation levels.\nAppreciating the Role of Luck: Investment outcomes are influenced by luck. Distinguish between skill and luck, and avoid being blinded by short-term success. Investors should focus on long-term performance and analyze the sources of returns, rather than just focusing on short-term gains.\nDiversification: Diversification is an important risk management tool, but understand correlations and avoid ineffective diversification. True diversification means holding assets that behave differently under different market conditions.\nAvoiding Mistakes: Avoiding major mistakes is more important than pursuing great success. Identify and avoid various types of errors, such as analytical errors, psychological errors, and failure to recognize cycles and market sentiment.\nThe Significance of Value Creation: Value creation requires superior investment skill. Understand alpha and beta, and strive for asymmetric investment performance, meaning achieving higher returns when the market rises and suffering fewer losses when the market falls.\nReasonable Expectations: Set reasonable return expectations and avoid being misled by unrealistic expectations. Excessively high return expectations are often accompanied by excessive risk. Understand how returns are generated and the conditions required to achieve objectives.\nThe Most Important Thing: Summarizes the core ideas of the book, emphasizing the importance of value assessment, risk control, contrarian investing, and psychological factors. Successful investing requires comprehensive consideration of these factors and the development of a complete investment framework.\nIII. Key Takeaways # \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a certain irony in the investing world: What\u0026rsquo;s obvious to everyone else is likely to be wrong.\u0026rdquo;\nInsight: Consensus views often lead to average results, at best. Superior returns require non-consensus views that prove to be correct.\n\u0026ldquo;Remember, your goal in investing isn\u0026rsquo;t to earn average returns; you want to do better than average.\u0026rdquo;\nInsight: Complacency is the enemy of superior performance. Strive to exceed benchmarks, not simply match them.\n\u0026ldquo;The widespread belief that there\u0026rsquo;s no risk is the biggest risk of all.\u0026rdquo;\nInsight: When markets are universally optimistic, risk is often at its highest because prices don\u0026rsquo;t reflect potential problems.\n\u0026ldquo;Only when the tide goes out do you discover who\u0026rsquo;s been swimming naked.\u0026rdquo;\nInsight: Adverse market conditions reveal the weaknesses in portfolios and investment strategies that were hidden during favorable periods.\n\u0026ldquo;It takes greatest courage, but provides the greatest profit, to buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are greedily buying.\u0026rdquo;\nInsight: Contrarian investing is difficult because it requires going against the crowd, but it offers the potential for the highest rewards.\n\u0026ldquo;One of the great things about investing is that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to make a lot of good decisions to do well. What\u0026rsquo;s essential is avoiding bad decisions.\u0026rdquo;\nInsight: Preserving capital is paramount. Avoiding significant losses has a greater impact on long-term returns than occasional big wins.\n\u0026ldquo;An investor needs do very few things right as long as he avoids big mistakes.\u0026rdquo;\nInsight: Risk management and capital preservation are the cornerstones of successful investing.\nIV.

Summary # This book unveils the real lives of American millionaires through a comprehensive survey, shattering the mystique surrounding them. The authors discovered that most American millionaires were not born with a silver spoon but built their wealth from scratch through frugality, hard work, self-discipline, and smart investing. The book also explores the definition of wealth, how to accumulate it, how to raise children, and how to distribute inheritance, offering a practical guide for those who aspire to build wealth.\nII. Chapter Summaries # Chapter 1: Meet the Millionaire Next Door # This chapter introduces the authors\u0026rsquo; motivation and methodology for surveying millionaires and paints a typical picture of an American millionaire: they are mostly self-made entrepreneurs who live frugally and focus on investment rather than conspicuous consumption. Through analyzing affluent individuals from diverse racial backgrounds and professions, the authors reveal the relationship between wealth accumulation and factors like racial origin and career choices, emphasizing the crucial role of \u0026ldquo;frugality\u0026rdquo; in wealth building. The authors introduce the concept of \u0026ldquo;Big Hat, No Cattle,\u0026rdquo; referring to the phenomenon that many who appear to be millionaires are not truly wealthy, while many genuine millionaires live modest, frugal lives. Chapter 2: Frugality: The Cornerstone of Wealth Building # This chapter delves into the theme of \u0026ldquo;frugality,\u0026rdquo; highlighting it as the foundation of wealth accumulation. By comparing the lifestyles and consumption habits of \u0026ldquo;Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAWs)\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Under Accumulators of Wealth (UAWs),\u0026rdquo; the authors demonstrate the decisive impact of frugality on wealth accumulation. For instance, the contrasting cases of Mr. Ford, a lawyer with high spending habits, and Mr. Richards, a mobile home dealer who lived frugally, ultimately show that Mr. Richards accumulated almost five times the wealth of Mr. Ford. This chapter points out that most American millionaires are first-generation affluent individuals who practice a lifestyle of saving more than they spend, refraining from splurging on luxury items like expensive clothing, watches, and cars. They accumulate wealth but maintain a moderately frugal lifestyle. This chapter also introduces a crucial wealth formula: Age multiplied by realized pretax annual household income, divided by 10, minus inherited wealth, equals your expected net worth. Using this formula, readers can calculate their expected net worth and assess whether they are PAWs, UAWs, or \u0026ldquo;Average Accumulators of Wealth (AAWs).\u0026rdquo; Chapter 3: Time, Energy, and Money # This chapter explores the importance of efficiently allocating \u0026ldquo;time, energy, and money\u0026rdquo; for wealth accumulation. By comparing how PAWs and UAWs allocate these three resources, the chapter illustrates that PAWs prioritize long-term planning, investment strategies, and risk management, while UAWs tend towards instant gratification, impulsive spending, and a lack of financial planning. This chapter emphasizes the importance of household budgeting, stating that even high earners need to meticulously plan and control expenses to accumulate wealth. The authors point out that PAWs spend significantly more time on financial planning than UAWs, and PAWs prefer to invest in appreciating assets like stocks and real estate, while UAWs tend to spend their money on consumer goods. The authors advise readers to manage their household finances like a business, creating a budget, controlling expenses, and regularly reviewing investment plans. Chapter 4: You Aren\u0026rsquo;t What You Drive # This chapter uses the car-buying habits of millionaires as an example to further illustrate the principle that \u0026ldquo;being financially independent is more important than displaying high social status.\u0026rdquo; The authors categorize millionaire car buyers into four types: \u0026ldquo;New-Car Dealers\u0026rsquo; Conservatives,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;New-Car Shoppers,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Used-Car Dealers\u0026rsquo; Conservatives,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Used-Car Shoppers.\u0026rdquo; By analyzing the purchasing behaviors of these four types, the authors find that \u0026ldquo;Used-Car Shoppers\u0026rdquo; are the most frugal, highly price-sensitive, and adept at leveraging various channels to find the best deals. This group is also the most likely to become PAWs. This chapter also notes that most millionaires buy American-made cars, and many buy used cars. They believe that cars are depreciating assets and there\u0026rsquo;s no need to spend excessively on new ones. Chapter 5: Economic Outpatient Care # This chapter explores the phenomenon of \u0026ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care,\u0026rdquo; where parents provide substantial financial assistance to their adult children, often leading to the children\u0026rsquo;s lack of financial independence and drive, ultimately hindering their ability to accumulate wealth. By comparing the wealth accumulation of children who receive \u0026ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care\u0026rdquo; with those who don\u0026rsquo;t, the authors illustrate the negative impact of this practice. For example, the case of Rama and Mary, a couple who received long-term financial support from Mary\u0026rsquo;s parents, ultimately developed high spending habits and failed to accumulate wealth. This chapter analyzes the causes of \u0026ldquo;Economic Outpatient Care\u0026rdquo; and offers suggestions to help affluent parents avoid the tragedy of \u0026ldquo;shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations.\u0026rdquo; For instance, parents should teach their children frugality and financial management instead of solely providing financial aid. This chapter points out that adult children who receive gifts from their parents generally perform worse in wealth accumulation compared to those who don\u0026rsquo;t. This is because receiving gifts can foster dependence and a tendency to spend the money on consumption rather than investment. Chapter 6: Rules of Thumb # This chapter discusses how affluent parents distribute wealth to their adult children and how they choose heirs. The authors note that affluent parents often distribute wealth based on their children\u0026rsquo;s professions, gender, and contributions to the family, tending to leave more to children who need financial assistance. For instance, homemakers often receive more inheritance than working children. This chapter also emphasizes the importance of choosing executors and suggests that affluent parents select an experienced professional as a co-executor to prevent inheritance disputes among children. This chapter offers advice to help affluent parents avoid family conflicts when distributing inheritance. For example, affluent parents should establish estate plans early and communicate with their children to ensure their wishes are understood. Chapter 7: Affirmative Action, Family Style # This chapter explores the business opportunities in providing products and services to the wealthy, noting that these opportunities will continue to grow with the increasing affluent population. The authors list several businesses and professions that can benefit from serving the wealthy, including specialized lawyers, healthcare and dental specialists, estate liquidators, educational institutions and professionals, and real estate experts. The authors also analyze the spending habits of the wealthy and point out that they are willing to spend on certain aspects, such as investment consulting, healthcare, and education, which provides significant business opportunities for many industries. Chapter 8: The Perfect Investment # This chapter discusses the relationship between career choice and wealth accumulation, pointing out that self-employed business owners and professionals are more likely to build wealth. By comparing the profitability and risks of different professions, the authors illustrate why self-employed business owners and professionals are more likely to accumulate wealth. For example, the average profit margin of a doctor\u0026rsquo;s office is higher than that of a coal mining operation. This chapter also analyzes why affluent parents often discourage their children from taking over family businesses and instead recommend pursuing careers as self-employed professionals. This is because self-employed professionals can leverage their knowledge and skills to generate sustainable income, and their careers tend to be more stable and less risky. III. Key Quotes # \u0026ldquo;Wealth is not the same as income. If you make a good income each year and spend it all, you are not getting wealthier. You are just living high. Wealth is what you accumulate, not what you spend.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote highlights the book\u0026rsquo;s core message: wealth accumulation is not solely based on high income but also relies on frugal habits and smart investment skills. High income doesn\u0026rsquo;t equate to wealth; only by converting income into assets can one achieve true financial freedom.\n\u0026ldquo;Frugality is the cornerstone of wealth building.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote emphasizes the crucial role of frugality in wealth accumulation. Only by controlling consumption can one free up more funds for investment, leading to wealth growth. Frugality doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean living an austere life but rather being a rational consumer and avoiding unnecessary waste.\n\u0026ldquo;To build wealth, minimize your realized (taxable) income and maximize your unrealized income (wealth that is not taxed until it is converted to cash).\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote reveals a vital strategy for wealthy individuals to accumulate wealth, namely, achieving wealth growth through investment rather than solely relying on salary income. One must skillfully utilize tax policies to convert income into tax-advantaged assets like stocks and real estate.\n\u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re not yet wealthy but want to be someday, never purchase a home that requires a mortgage that is more than twice your household\u0026rsquo;s total annual realized income.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote offers practical advice for those in the early stages of wealth accumulation: avoid excessive mortgage burdens and allocate more funds towards investment. When funds are limited, prioritize investment over consumption.\n\u0026ldquo;Those who are financially independent are considerably happier than those in the same income/age cohort who are not financially secure.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote illustrates the importance of financial security for personal happiness. Possessing sufficient wealth allows individuals to face life\u0026rsquo;s challenges with greater confidence. Economic independence is the foundation of personal freedom and a crucial guarantee of happiness.\n\u0026ldquo;Never tell children that their parents are wealthy.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote provides valuable educational advice for affluent parents: avoid letting children know about the family\u0026rsquo;s wealth too early to prevent them from developing dependence and a lack of initiative. Children need to understand that wealth is created through their own efforts.\n\u0026ldquo;No matter how wealthy you are, teach your children to be self-sufficient and frugal.\u0026rdquo;\nAnalysis: This quote emphasizes the importance of frugality and self-discipline. Even children from affluent families should develop good habits to better adapt to future challenges. Children need to understand that frugality is a virtue and a prerequisite for success.\nIV. Significance # Importance of Frugality and Financial Management: This book highlights the importance of frugality and investment, helping readers establish a correct perspective on wealth and offering practical financial advice. There are no shortcuts to wealth creation; only through diligent saving and rational investment can one steadily accumulate wealth. Wisdom in Raising Children: This book explores how to raise children to be financially responsible individuals, providing insights into the educational experiences and methods of affluent parents and inspiring readers to reflect on their own parenting styles. Affluent parents should focus on cultivating their children\u0026rsquo;s independence, responsibility, and financial management skills instead of solely providing financial assistance. Career Choices and Wealth Accumulation: This book analyzes the profitability and risks of different professions, helping readers better understand the relationship between career choices and wealth accumulation and providing guidance for individual career planning. Choosing a career with development potential that aligns with one\u0026rsquo;s interests and abilities is a crucial prerequisite for achieving wealth accumulation. Business Opportunities in Serving the Wealthy: This book reveals the vast business opportunities in providing products and services to the wealthy, offering insights and inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs.

True wealth encompasses more than just money; it also includes health, happiness, family, and a sense of accomplishment. In conclusion, \u0026ldquo;The Millionaire Next Door\u0026rdquo; is a timeless classic worth revisiting. It not only unveils the secrets to the success of the wealthy but also provides valuable insights and methods for ordinary readers to accumulate wealth, raise children, and plan their lives.\nRecommended Reading List 1 October 2024\u0026middot; loading \u0026middot; loading Recommended Book ","date":"15 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/1728996298300/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Millionaire Next Door: Book Notes","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2024-10-15","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÊïôËÇ≤","type":"tags"},{"content":" I. Content Summary # This book is divided into two parts: saving and investing. The saving section covers all aspects of saving money, including how much to save, how to save more, and how to spend money without guilt. The investing section covers many aspects of making money with money, including why you should invest, what you should invest in, and how often you should invest. The author answers the most common questions in the field of personal finance and investing, with each chapter exploring a topic in depth and providing practical tips. Using a large amount of data and empirical research as evidence, the author arrives at reliable ways to save money and build wealth.\nII. Chapter Summary # Chapter 1. Where Should You Start? # The poor should focus on saving, and the rich should focus on investing.\nRecent graduates should focus on increasing their income and savings rate, rather than obsessing over investment decisions, because the growth rate of savings far exceeds the growth rate of investment. People who have accumulated a certain amount of wealth should spend more time thinking about the details of their investment plan. The author proposes a \u0026ldquo;Save-Invest continuum\u0026rdquo; concept to help you determine your current financial focus: calculate your expected savings and expected investment growth. Focus on whichever is greater. Chapter 2. How Much Should You Save? # You probably need to save less than you think.\nMany saving recommendations are based on false assumptions: that people\u0026rsquo;s incomes are stable and that everyone has the ability to achieve the same savings rate. In fact, incomes become more unstable over time, and the biggest determinant of an individual\u0026rsquo;s savings rate is their income level. The best saving advice is: save what you can save. A large body of evidence suggests that retirees generally don\u0026rsquo;t spend enough, with many even increasing their financial assets after retirement. Today\u0026rsquo;s younger generation is not creating wealth any slower than previous generations, so there is no need to worry too much about running out of money after retirement. Chapter 3. How to Save More Money? # The biggest lie in personal finance: you can get rich just by saving.\nThe effectiveness of reducing spending is limited. For low-income people, spending is already at its lowest level, making it difficult to reduce further. The author uses data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey to support this point. Increasing income is more effective than reducing spending because as income increases, spending does not necessarily increase proportionately (diminishing marginal utility). The author calls this the \u0026ldquo;law of the stomach.\u0026rdquo; Five ways to increase your income: Sell your time/expertise: easy to do, but not scalable. Sell a skill/service: higher income, but takes time to develop skills. Teach: easy to scale, but highly competitive. Sell a product: scalable, but requires a lot of upfront investment and ongoing marketing efforts. Climb the career ladder: traditional but effective, can gain skills, experience and stable income growth. The most reliable way to get rich is: Increase your income and invest in income-producing assets. Chapter 4. How to Spend Money Without Guilt? # Most financial advice uses guilt to make you question your spending decisions, causing you to be overly nervous about spending money. Two tips to help you make financial decisions without worry and spend money without guilt: The 2x rule: When you splurge, invest the same amount of money in income-producing assets or donate it to charity. For example, if you want to buy a pair of $400 shoes, buy $400 worth of stock at the same time. Focus on maximizing satisfaction: Think about whether your purchase can bring autonomy, mastery, and purpose, thereby increasing your long-term satisfaction. For example, a daily latte might allow you to do your job better. The only right way to spend money is: the way that works for you. Think about what you want to get out of life, and make spending decisions accordingly. Research from the University of Cambridge shows that the more your spending patterns match your psychological state, the higher your life satisfaction, and this effect is greater than the happiness brought by your total income. Chapter 5. How Much Lifestyle Inflation Is Harmless? # Lifestyle inflation refers to the increase in spending that follows an increase in one\u0026rsquo;s income. Some lifestyle inflation is enjoyable, but too much lifestyle inflation will lead to having to delay retirement. The author simulates the retirement plans of two investors with different savings rates after salary increases to arrive at these conclusions: The lower your current savings rate, the higher your lifestyle inflation can be without affecting your original retirement plan. The author recommends saving at least 50% of your future raises, a rule that is simple, practical, and suitable for most people. Chapter 6. Should You Go Into Debt? # Debt is not necessarily good or bad, it depends on how you use it.\nDebt as a form of risk mitigation: Some people, even with savings, keep credit card debt as a strategy to reduce the risk of future funding shortages. Debt as a behavioral pillar of forced savings: Some people use debt as a behavioral pillar to force themselves to save. The two most useful types of debt: To reduce risk: for example, keeping cash on hand for emergencies or fixing housing costs. To earn a return higher than the cost of borrowing: for example, by taking out education loans, business loans, or mortgages to generate higher returns. The author uses data to demonstrate that getting a college degree is often worthwhile. Debt can also have non-financial costs, such as psychological stress and health problems, so non-mortgage financial debt should be avoided as much as possible. Chapter 7. Should You Rent or Buy? # The point of buying a home is not whether to buy it, but when to buy it.\nIn addition to the mortgage, there are a number of one-time and ongoing costs associated with buying a home, such as down payment, closing costs, taxes, maintenance, and insurance. The author details these costs, concluding that buying a home is only cost-effective if the buyer intends to live in it for the long term. In the short term, buying a home is riskier than renting, but in the long term, renters face greater long-term risks such as rent fluctuations, housing instability, and moving costs. In the United States, the long-term return on homeownership as an investment is not ideal, far lower than the stock market. The author uses the example of his grandparents buying a home to illustrate this point. The right time to buy a home is when you: plan to stay in that location for at least ten years; have a stable personal and professional life; can afford a 20% down payment and keep your debt-to-income ratio below 43%. The author recommends, if possible, to make a 20% down payment and buy a larger home in one step, because the transaction costs are lower in the long run. Chapter 8. How to Save For a Down Payment (and Other Big Purchases)? # Why the length of time you save matters?\nShort-term saving for less than two years: Holding cash is the best option, as it has the lowest risk. Long-term saving for more than two years: Investing in bonds is preferable to holding cash because bond returns can offset the effects of inflation. The author compares cash and bonds using two examples: \u0026ldquo;Save $1,000 per month with a goal of $24,000\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Save $1,000 per month with a goal of $60,000\u0026rdquo;. Longer-term saving for more than three years: You can choose to invest in stocks, but the risk is higher and you need to choose an appropriate portfolio based on your own risk tolerance. The author uses data to show that stocks have much higher long-term returns than bonds, but also greater volatility. Chapter 9. When Can You Retire? # There\u0026rsquo;s more to consider than just money when it comes to retirement.\nThe 4% rule: When your retirement savings reach 25 times your expected annual expenses, you can retire. You can withdraw 4% of your investment assets (half bonds and half stocks) in the first year of retirement, and increase the amount withdrawn by 3% each year to keep up with inflation. If you have a pension or other guaranteed income, you only need to save 25 times your \u0026ldquo;annual excess spending\u0026rdquo; (expected annual expenses less future guaranteed income). The crossover point rule: The point at which your monthly investment income is greater than your monthly expenses, you have reached the \u0026ldquo;crossover point\u0026rdquo; and achieved financial freedom. \u0026ldquo;Crossover Assets\u0026rdquo; = Monthly Expenses / Monthly Investment Return. Retirement is much more than just a financial decision, it\u0026rsquo;s a lifestyle decision. You need to think about what you want to do and how you want to live after retirement. The author uses the examples of several celebrities to illustrate the confusion and emptiness that can exist after early retirement. Chapter 10. Why You Should Invest? # Three reasons to make your money grow.\nSave for your future self: Investing allows you to have a pool of resources to draw from as you age. Human lifespans are increasing, and the concept of \u0026ldquo;retirement\u0026rdquo; has emerged accordingly. To ensure quality of life after retirement, it is necessary to invest in advance. Fight inflation and maintain the purchasing power of your wealth: Investing can offset the impact of inflation and maintain or increase your purchasing power. The author uses data to show that investing can effectively combat the effects of inflation. Replace your human capital with financial capital: Investing can turn your diminishing human capital into financial capital that can continue to generate returns. The author illustrates this with the example of professional athletes. Chapter 11. What Should You Invest In? # There is no single right way to get rich.\nThe author lists a variety of income-producing assets, including: Stocks: One of the most reliable ways to build wealth over the long term, easy to own and trade, with low maintenance costs, but highly volatile and valuations easily influenced by market sentiment. Bonds: Low volatility, safe principal, and helpful in rebalancing portfolios, but returns are generally lower than stocks, especially in a low interest rate environment. Investment real estate: Returns are higher than stocks or bonds, especially when using leverage, but require more effort to manage and are difficult to diversify. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): Provide access to real estate investment income without needing to manage it yourself, but are more volatile and highly correlated with stocks and other risky assets during stock market crashes. Farmland: Low correlation with stocks and bonds, low volatility, inflation-resistant, but low liquidity, higher fees, and requires \u0026ldquo;accredited investor\u0026rdquo; status to participate. Small businesses/franchises/angel investing: Potential for high returns and the more effort you put in, the greater the return, but requires a significant time commitment and has a high failure rate. Royalties: Can generate stable income that is uncorrelated with traditional financial assets, but sellers incur high fees and public taste changes are unpredictable. Your own products: 100% ownership, personal satisfaction and achievement, can create a valuable brand, but very labor-intensive and no guarantee of return. The author also contrasts the characteristics of income-producing and non-income-producing assets (e.g., gold, cryptocurrency, art, etc.) and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Chapter 12. Why You Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t Buy Individual Stocks? # Why underperforming the market is the least of your worries?\nMost people (even professionals) can\u0026rsquo;t beat the market. Data from the SPIVA report shows that active funds tend to underperform index funds over the long term. Only a very small percentage of individual stocks outperform in the long run. Bessembinder\u0026rsquo;s research indicates that since 1926, only 4% of stocks have generated returns that exceed U.S. Treasury bonds. Even stocks that outperform are not always winners. West\u0026rsquo;s statistical analysis suggests that many companies will disappear within a decade. Choosing individual stocks is emotionally draining and stressful. The author uses the example of his friend Darren investing in GameStop stock to detail the emotional rollercoaster of stock trading. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell if you\u0026rsquo;re really good at picking stocks. The link between stock picking decisions and outcomes is not significant, making it difficult to assess your stock picking skills. Even if you have performed well in the past, there is no guarantee that you will continue to do so in the future. The risk of holding a concentrated position in a single stock is that the return is lower than the market. The author uses data on U.S. stock performance since 1963 to show that the median return of individual stocks is lower than that of index funds. The author suggests buying index funds or ETFs to earn market average returns, which can lead to higher returns and less stress during the investment process. Chapter 13. How Early Should You Start Investing? # Why buying early is better than buying late?\nMost markets tend to go up most of the time, so investing early allows for a longer period of compounding growth. The author compares two investment strategies: Buy now: Put all the money you can invest in immediately. Average in: Invest the money you can invest in batches. Conclusion: The buy now strategy is generally better than the average-in strategy. The author uses U.S. stock market data from 1997 to 2020, as well as U.S. stock market data from 1920 to 2020, to respectively prove this conclusion. The same results hold when testing other types of assets. For risk-averse investors, you can choose to invest in a lower risk portfolio. For example, change an 80% stock / 20% bond portfolio to a 60% stock / 40% bond portfolio. Even if market valuations are high, the buy now strategy is still better than the average in strategy. The author compares the two strategies using CAPE percentile categories, and the results show that the buy now strategy is still superior even during periods of high valuations. For investors concerned about the risk of a lump sum investment, you can take a longer time to gradually adjust to your target asset allocation. Chapter 14. Why You Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t Wait to Buy the Dip? # Even God can\u0026rsquo;t beat dollar-cost averaging.\nThe buy the dip strategy only works if the market is about to have a big drop and you can accurately predict when it will happen. Big market drops don\u0026rsquo;t happen that often, so the buy the dip strategy has a small chance of beating dollar-cost averaging. The author simulates the two strategies using U.S. stock market data from between 1920 and 1980. The results show that in all forty-year investment periods, the buy-the-dip strategy underperformed dollar-cost averaging more than 70% of the time. Even with perfect information, the buy the dip strategy often loses to dollar-cost averaging because the market may continue to rise while you miss out on compounding growth. The author simulates the two strategies using U.S. stock market data from 1975 onward, again proving this conclusion. Even if the predicted time of the market bottom is off by only two months, the long-term investment performance of the buy-the-dip strategy still loses to dollar-cost averaging. Conclusion: you should invest as early as possible and as often as possible. Investment returns are heavily influenced by time, and the power of strategy is far less than the power of market change. Chapter 15. Why Does Investing Involve Luck? # And why you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t care.\nThe year you were born influences your investment returns because markets fluctuate unpredictably. The author illustrates this with data on 10-, 20-, and 30-year investment returns in the U.S. stock market since 1910. The sequence of investment returns also affects your final return because you invest more money in the later stages of your investment, so later returns are more important. The author illustrates the impact of return sequence with two cases of 20-year investment horizons with the same annualized return but in reverse order. How to mitigate bad luck: Hold low-risk assets (such as bonds) for the long term to diversify risk. Withdraw less money during market downturns. Consider getting a part-time job to supplement your income. Chapter 16. Why You Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t Fear Market Volatility? # The price of admission for successful investing.\nAvoiding too many market declines can limit your upside. Using the analogy of a \u0026ldquo;market genie\u0026rdquo; that tells you the maximum intra-year drawdown for the coming year, the author simulates different risk aversion strategies. The conclusion is that if you want to maximize long-term wealth, you should accept some degree of intra-year market decline (0% to 15%) and avoid large intra-year market declines (greater than 15%). Buying a diversified portfolio of income-producing assets over the long term is one of the best ways to combat market volatility as it rears its ugly head. Chapter 17. How to Buy During a Crisis? # Why you should keep your cool when the market panics?\nMarket crashes are opportunities to buy because every dollar you invest at this point will earn a higher return after the market recovers. The author uses the 1929 U.S. stock market crash as an example to illustrate the excess returns of investing at the bottom of the market. The more the market falls, the higher the return you need to make up for the loss. The author illustrates this with a simple mathematical formula and chart. Even if the market takes a long time to recover, buying during a crisis is still a good decision because you can earn a decent annualized return while you wait. The author proves this conclusion using examples of the U.S. stock market falling 30% and 50% between 1920 and 2020. Most stock markets trend upwards most of the time, and even if a prolonged downturn occurs, the likelihood of losing money is significantly reduced if you make regular investments as most investors do, rather than a single lump sum investment. The author illustrates this with the example of the Japanese stock market. Chapter 18. When Should You Sell? # About rebalancing, concentrated positions, and the purpose of investing.\nThree situations where you should consider selling an investment asset: Rebalancing your portfolio. Getting rid of a concentrated (or consistently losing) investment position. Meeting your financial needs. You should have a plan in place before you consider selling investment assets to avoid emotional decisions. Selling gradually (or selling later) is generally better than selling immediately, because in the long run, the market tends to go up. Regularly rebalancing your portfolio can reduce risk, but it generally reduces returns. The author simulates two strategies, annual rebalancing and never rebalancing, using a portfolio of 60% stocks/40% bonds, and compares the returns and maximum drawdowns after 30 years. Accumulative rebalancing is a better way to rebalance by buying asset classes that are underweight over time to avoid incurring tax liabilities. The author uses the same portfolio to simulate a strategy of adding investments each month, demonstrating that this strategy can effectively reduce the maximum drawdown. For investors holding large concentrated positions, it is advisable to sell some of the assets to reduce risk and meet their own living needs. Selling strategies can range from selling a portion on a regular basis to selling based on price levels, as long as it is decided in advance. Chapter 19. Where Should Your Investments Be Held? # On taxes, traditional 401(k) vs. Roth 401(k), and why you might not want to maximize your 401(k).\nTax policy in the United States is constantly changing, and financial management should also be adjusted according to tax policy. The author reviews the history of income tax in the United States to illustrate this point. When choosing between a traditional 401(k) and a Roth 401(k), the most important factor is whether your effective income tax rate is higher now (during your working years) or later (in retirement). The author favors traditional 401(k)s because they offer more flexibility and allow you to convert funds to a Roth IRA when tax rates are lower, such as when you are in business school or on maternity leave. Roth 401(k)s may be a better option for high savers because they can enjoy greater total tax deferral benefits. The author illustrates this with the example of Sally and Sam. Using a retirement savings account to invest can avoid capital gains taxes, which can lead to significant long-term gains. The author uses simulated data to compare the returns of three approaches: tax-free accounts, accounts taxed once on capital gains, and accounts taxed annually on capital gains. The author also explains the impact of compounding on investment returns. Maximizing your 401(k) may not be the best option because 401(k) plan fees may offset the tax benefits. The author suggests that you should at least increase your personal contributions to the point where you can receive the maximum employer match. For any contributions beyond that, you need to take into account the 401(k)\u0026rsquo;s expense ratio and your own need for liquidity. When allocating assets, it is advisable to place high-growth assets (e.g. stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and low-growth assets (e.g. bonds) in taxable accounts. Chapter 20. Why Will You Never Feel Rich? # You might already be rich, so why not?\nPeople can always find someone richer than themselves, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to feel content. The author illustrates people\u0026rsquo;s sense of relative wealth by telling the story of Powerball lottery winner Jack Whittaker, and the story of his friend John. If you compare yourself to people around the world, you may find that you are much richer than you think. For example, if your net worth is over $4,210, you are wealthier than half the world; if your net worth is over $93,170, you are in the top 10% of the world\u0026rsquo;s wealth. Don\u0026rsquo;t let feelings of relative wealth affect your happiness and appreciate the wealth you have. Chapter 21. The Most Important Asset # Why you can never get more of this asset.\nTime is your most important asset, and how you use your time will have a huge impact on your future life. The author tells the story of Dashrath Manjhi, an Indian villager who carved a road through a mountain, to illustrate the power of time. In your younger years, you should prioritize career development because that\u0026rsquo;s when your income grows the fastest. The author uses his own experience to illustrate the importance of making the right career choices early on. Don\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice your time in pursuit of money, because you can never buy more time with money. People\u0026rsquo;s happiness tends to follow a U-shaped curve as they age, overestimating their future happiness in their youth, being more pessimistic in middle age, and feeling pleasantly surprised in old age. Conclusion. The Just Keep Buying Rules # How to win the time traveler\u0026rsquo;s game?\nThe author summarizes 21 financial guidelines to help you succeed on your financial journey, these guidelines are called the \u0026ldquo;Just Keep Buying Rules\u0026rdquo;: The poor should focus on saving, and the rich should focus on investing. Save what you can save. Focus on income, not expenses. Use the \u0026ldquo;2x rule\u0026rdquo; to eliminate spending guilt. Save at least 50% of your future raises and bonuses. Debt is not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing, it depends on how you use it. Only buy a house when the timing is right. Use cash when saving for large purchases. There\u0026rsquo;s more to retirement than just money. Invest to accumulate financial capital to replace your diminishing human capital. Think like an owner and buy income-producing assets. Don\u0026rsquo;t buy individual stocks. Buy fast, sell slow. Invest as early and as often as possible. Investing is not just about the cards you have, it\u0026rsquo;s also about how you play them. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid when volatility inevitably comes. Market crashes are usually opportunities to buy. Use your money for the life you need before risking it for the life you want. Think twice before maximizing your 401(k). You\u0026rsquo;ll never feel rich, and that\u0026rsquo;s okay. Time is your most important asset. III. Quotes # The surest way to get rich is to increase your income and invest in income-producing assets.\nAnalysis: Instead of blindly pursuing saving, it is better to focus your energy on increasing your income and investing in assets that can generate income; this is a more reliable path to financial freedom.\nThe only right way to spend money is the way that works for you.\nAnalysis: Everyone\u0026rsquo;s values, life goals, and preferences are different, so their financial management style should also be personalized. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly follow the crowd; find a spending pattern that suits you in order to achieve true happiness.\nTime is your most important asset.\nAnalysis: Time is a non-renewable resource. We should cherish time and spend it on the most valuable things. Investing early is not only about accumulating wealth, but also about buying back more time and freedom.\nIV.

Main Topic # The most important thing in investing is maximizing the probability of success, not maximizing returns. Investors should control risks, avoid being forced to interrupt compounding due to market fluctuations, and choose investment portfolios that can be held for the long term. James emphasizes the importance of asset allocation, especially the role of cash, and the need to choose appropriate investment strategies based on different individuals (retired/not retired, different asset sizes).\nII. Briefing Content # The Most Important Thing in Investing: The goal of investing is to maximize the probability of success, not to maximize the rate of return. Risk management is to maximize the success of the investment portfolio and avoid interrupting compound growth due to being forced to sell because of market fluctuations. Good investment assets must be able to withstand fear and panic. The best investment strategies are those that do not create fear and panic. Sufficient cash is the best asset to help you sleep well and survive a sharp market decline. Risks of Stock Pledging: Stock pledging can easily lead to bankruptcy if asset allocation is not done properly. Do not try stock pledging lightly if you do not understand the operating principles of stock pledging, otherwise, you will most likely go bankrupt. Most people do not need to do stock pledging. Good asset allocation can make you rich without pledging. Asset Allocation for Different Individuals: Individuals who are not retired and have salary income: Refer to the article \u0026ldquo;Asset Allocation for Those Who Are Still Some Time Away from Retirement\u0026rdquo;, with QQQ as the main investment. Individuals who are retired and have no income: Refer to the article \u0026ldquo;Asset Allocation for Those Who Are Retired and Have No Income\u0026rdquo;, and choose QQQ, SPY, or high-dividend ETFs for allocation based on asset size, and consider the withdrawal rate. Investment and Life Philosophy: Investing is like life. It requires continuous learning and experiencing different stages to find an investment strategy that suits you. Resist temptation, avoid chasing short-term hotspots, and adhere to long-term investment. A-share Market Volatility: The A-share market has recently experienced a surge and a plunge, with many investors being trapped due to chasing hotspots. Market fluctuations are normal, especially in emerging markets. Investors need to be rational and adhere to long-term investment strategies. The Chinese government\u0026rsquo;s cooling measures are aimed at preventing further expansion of the bubble and protecting the interests of investors. Beware of Pump and Dump Schemes: Some online groups and \u0026ldquo;teachers\u0026rdquo; use market forecasts and insider information to induce investors to make trades and profit from them. Be wary of these pump and dump schemes. The futures market, due to its smaller scale, is more susceptible to manipulation. Be wary of pump and dump schemes in the futures market as well. CLEC Investment and Financial Management Channel Update Plan: Due to the time-consuming nature of producing short videos and the low viewership, we plan to stop updating short videos. The content of the produced short videos will be condensed into a briefing format and shared with you on Saturdays for discussion. It is recommended that you listen to long videos several times or listen to them in segments to achieve the same learning effect. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Ethan:\nSharing: In China, a similar effect to stock pledging can be achieved through the margin financing function of securities firms. Sharing: The A-share market has recently experienced drastic fluctuations, and many investors have been influenced by the media to chase hotspots, resulting in heavy losses. Viewpoint: If you don\u0026rsquo;t have the right understanding of the stock market, you are the victim. Jackie:\nSharing: Her personal journey of investing in the Nasdaq, from skepticism to firm holding, and finally overcoming psychological barriers to achieve \u0026ldquo;buy whenever you have money\u0026rdquo;. H:\nSharing: Followed recommendations for meme stocks in 2021, resulting in heavy losses. Started gradually transferring funds to QQQ in 2023 and using leverage. Question: The current proportions of QQQ, QLD, and SGOV have deviated from the initial 70%, 20%, and 10%. Is rebalancing needed? How should it be rebalanced? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: It is recommended to adopt a smart rebalancing strategy. Transfer 30% of the QLD profits to SGOV. When the market falls, transfer 2% of the total assets in cash to QLD. Im:\nSharing: Uses the mural story of Journey to the West as an analogy for the different stages of investment, reminding investors not to chase short-term gains and to adhere to long-term investment and continuous learning. Question: How to persuade people who spend extravagantly to develop the habit of saving? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: You can introduce them to the concept of long-term investment in index funds and the power of compound growth. Provide help within your means. Question: If you also have the habit of spending extravagantly, how do you control it? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Live within your means. As your wealth grows, it is normal for your living standards to gradually improve within the scope of risk control, but avoid excessive consumption and spending beyond your means. Sunny:\nSharing: The CLEC course not only teaches investment knowledge but also conveys life philosophy, helping everyone maintain a stable mindset in life and work. Viewpoint: People with stable emotions are the most valuable. Investing in QQQ also brings peace of mind. Beisen:\nBackground: Assets of 70 million, monthly mortgage payment of 125,000. Question: How to allocate assets to achieve early retirement? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Based on the current assets and expenses, immediate retirement is not possible. It is recommended to try the SPY asset allocation strategy, or use part of the funds to invest in high-dividend ETFs, and control the withdrawal rate. Kevin:\nQuestion: Why has Tesla fallen so much? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Investing in individual stocks requires understanding the company better than the CEO to grasp the ups and downs of the stock price. If you don\u0026rsquo;t understand Tesla\u0026rsquo;s business model, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t invest in it. Question: If you are very confident in Tesla, can you hold it for the long term? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: If you truly understand and are optimistic about Tesla, you can hold it for the long term, but you must manage risks well. Question: Does the teacher think the stock market will fall to zero? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: \u0026ldquo;Falling to zero\u0026rdquo; is a figure of speech, which means that even if the stock does not completely fall to zero, it will not be able to be realized if it falls to a certain level, and cash is needed to maintain life. Ming:\nSharing: I have invested in individual stocks before, and they all ended up going to zero in the end, so now I want to learn how to invest in index ETFs. Background: Total assets of 3.3 million, of which 2 million are in a brokerage account, 300,000 are in a Roth account, and 1 million are in a traditional IRA account. About to retire. Question: How to allocate cash and index ETFs? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: It is recommended to fully invest the brokerage account in SPY, the Roth account in TQQQ, and 60% of the traditional IRA account in money market funds and 40% in SPY. Question: How to withdraw funds after retirement? Do you sell even in a loss state? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: After retirement, you can withdraw 3% of your total assets for living expenses. You can sell SPY or obtain funds through stock pledging loans. You have to sell even in a loss state because you need cash to maintain your life. Question: Is the risk of investing in TQQQ in a Roth account too high? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: It is to maintain a certain cash ratio while obtaining relatively high returns. In extreme cases, you can transfer cash from the traditional IRA to the brokerage account or sell TQQQ to supplement cash. Question: How to transfer funds from a traditional IRA to a Roth account? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Transfer out a portion of the money every year and use loans or salary to pay taxes. Question: Why is the borrowing interest rate 5% and the cash interest rate only 2.5% when calculating interest in SPACE? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: This is just a conservative estimate. The yield of money market funds is usually lower than the borrowing interest rate. Sara:\nSharing: I have been investing in QQQ for three years and recently also invested in meme stocks. Question: I plan to borrow money to invest. Should I buy QLD? How should cash be allocated? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Based on Sara\u0026rsquo;s questions, it can be seen that she does not understand the concepts of stock pledging, leveraged ETFs, and asset allocation. Borrowing money to invest is not recommended. It is recommended to continue holding the 80% QQQ + 20% cash portfolio, and cash can be invested in BOXS. Tom:\nQuestion: How to maintain the cash ratio and avoid excessive tax rates in the case of long-term borrowing to live? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Leveraged ETFs and cash should be placed in retirement accounts as much as possible. Borrowing from a brokerage account should not exceed 70% of the account assets. Invest Roth IRA in TQQQ and hold cash in a traditional IRA. In extreme cases, the cash in the traditional IRA can be transferred to the brokerage account or TQQQ can be sold to supplement cash. The borrowing amount should be controlled within a certain range, for example, not exceeding 2% of the total assets per year. Taxes incurred by transferring a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA can be paid with loans or salary. Question: Why is the borrowing interest rate 5% while the cash interest rate is only calculated as 2.5% in SPACE? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: This is just a conservative estimate. Money market fund yields are usually lower than borrowing rates. Question: How to handle it if funds in the Brokerage account need to be used before retirement? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: You can use the funds in the Brokerage account for a pledge loan, but you need sufficient cash as a guarantee. Question: What if the cash in the Brokerage account is insufficient to cover the loan in the event of an extreme stock market decline? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: In extreme cases, you can transfer the cash in the Roth or Traditional IRA account to the Brokerage account, but this is an emergency measure and will incur penalties. Question: Is investing TQQQ in a Roth IRA too risky? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Investing Roth IRA in TQQQ is to obtain higher returns while ensuring a certain cash ratio. If you are concerned about risks, you can appropriately reduce the proportion of TQQQ and increase the proportion of money market funds. Question: In the long run, will borrowing from a Brokerage account lead to paying high taxes? James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Borrowing itself does not increase the tax burden, but it can avoid the tax burden caused by selling stocks. However, if you transfer funds from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, it will increase your taxable income for the year and you will need to pay additional taxes. IV.

Summary # \u0026ldquo;Property of Money\u0026rdquo; is Korean entrepreneur Kim Seung-ho\u0026rsquo;s insightful account of his path to financial success. Starting from humble beginnings, he climbed the economic ladder, gaining profound insights into the multifaceted nature of money. Driven by a desire to share his valuable experiences, the book explores five key attributes of money and outlines four essential skills necessary for achieving wealth. Through compelling stories and real-life examples, Kim Seung-ho demystifies complex economic concepts and investment principles, offering readers a practical guide towards financial freedom.\nII. Chapter Summary # Part 1: The Essence of Money # Money is Personified: Kim personifies money, suggesting it possesses emotions and will. Your attitude towards money influences how it behaves towards you. Respect and treat it like a friend to earn its favor.\nInvesting in Superior Entrepreneurs: Investing in companies and entrepreneurs more competent than oneself is a wise move, akin to partnering with them and reaping the rewards of their success. The author shares how he invested in successful companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Nike, effectively becoming their \u0026ldquo;partner.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Secret of Compound Interest: Compound interest is a fundamental principle in investment, capable of multiplying wealth. However, one must also be wary of its power when applied to debt. The author uses Warren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Mona Lisa\u0026rdquo; analogy to illustrate the impact of compound interest.\nThe Strength of Fixed Income: Stable cash flow surpasses inconsistent income, attracting and accumulating wealth. Kim compares fixed income to a well-trained army, capable of efficiently managing a large-scale organization despite smaller numbers.\nMoney\u0026rsquo;s Gravitational Force: Substantial wealth attracts more wealth. Starting with small accumulations, compound interest propels wealth multiplication, much like the Earth formed from the gradual attraction of minuscule particles. The author illustrates this concept with the Han River and the Amazon River, demonstrating how small streams can converge to form vast rivers.\nHighest Risk, Lowest Risk: The stock market is riskiest when everyone is bullish and chasing the latest hot stock; conversely, it\u0026rsquo;s least risky when fear grips the market and everyone is selling. Maintain a balanced perspective on fear and greed, embracing opportunity during widespread fear and exercising caution when greed prevails. Warren Buffet\u0026rsquo;s famous quote, \u0026ldquo;Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,\u0026rdquo; encapsulates this wisdom. The author uses the example of increased airline safety a week after an accident to illustrate this point.\nTreat Others\u0026rsquo; Money as You Treat Your Own: Treating others\u0026rsquo; money with respect safeguards your own from similar disrespect. Respect for others\u0026rsquo; money is reciprocated. The author uses his attitude towards shopping carts at supermarkets to emphasize the importance of respecting others\u0026rsquo; money.\nInheriting Millions with a \u0026ldquo;No Loss\u0026rdquo; Clause: Through a hypothetical scenario, Kim highlights that preserving wealth is not straightforward. It requires learning, accumulating experience, and recognizing the significance of consistent income. The protagonist in the story inherits a substantial sum with the stipulation of no loss, ultimately realizing that maintaining wealth\u0026rsquo;s value is no easy feat.\nRejecting Quick Riches: The pursuit of quick wealth often leads to speculative traps and the perils of greed, ultimately ending in failure. Building wealth demands a steady and gradual approach. The author uses the analogy of constructing a house to demonstrate the importance of gradual wealth accumulation.\nCan Economists Predict the Future?: No one can accurately predict the macroeconomic future, especially in the long term, due to inherent uncertainties. Resist blindly following expert predictions; cultivate independent thinking and continuous learning. Kim quotes economist John Kenneth Galbraith: \u0026ldquo;There are two kinds of people in the world: those who don\u0026rsquo;t know and those who don\u0026rsquo;t know they don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo;\nBuying Samsung Stock at Samsung Securities: This anecdote illustrates the need for knowledge before venturing into investments. Avoid assumptions; understand market rules and investment tools. Kim compares the stock market to a ruthless jungle, where knowledge is essential for survival.\nChanging Your Destiny Through Respectful Address: A personal experience highlights the importance of respecting others and showing genuine interest in their affairs, leading to trust, goodwill, and ultimately, good fortune. The entrepreneur in the story habitually addresses everyone as \u0026ldquo;that person,\u0026rdquo; ultimately losing friends and connections.\nRepeated Luck is Skill, Repeated Failure is Habit: Lucky individuals often possess greater astuteness and intelligence. They excel at observation, learning, and accumulating experience. Conversely, repeated failure calls for introspection and addressing personal shortcomings. The author uses examples like lottery tickets, rock-paper-scissors, and parking spots to illustrate the interplay of luck and skill.\nDiscerning Fact from Investment Hype in News: Using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example, Kim underlines the importance of focusing on facts and data, rather than blindly trusting media reports and expert predictions. He reached a more accurate assessment by comparing the total number of infections with the infection rate.\nEach Dollar Experiences Time Differently: Borrowing Einstein\u0026rsquo;s theory of relativity, the author suggests that money is also subject to the influence of time. Different sources of money experience time differently; always invest with money that has ample time. Kim compares \u0026ldquo;time-rich\u0026rdquo; money to individuals who have more time to build relationships, fall in love, and raise children.\nDiversification Isn\u0026rsquo;t Enough: Kim critiques the misinterpretation of the saying \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t put all your eggs in one basket.\u0026rdquo; Diversifying within a single market is merely using multiple baskets on the same shelf, still exposed to risk. He recommends spreading investments across diverse markets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate.\nThree Paths to Wealth: The author outlines three ways to become wealthy: inheritance, winning the lottery, and business success. He encourages young people to pursue entrepreneurship or engage in long-term investment. Kim elaborates on two paths to business success: starting a business or investing in successful companies.\nWhy Savings Don\u0026rsquo;t Grow: The root causes of stagnant savings lie in spending future income, neglecting asset management, undervaluing small amounts of money, and lacking investment knowledge. The author advises readers to ditch credit cards, use debit cards, and appreciate the power of accumulating small amounts of money.\nPart 2: The Wisdom of Investment # Identifying Financial Illiteracy: Kim presents a list of 90+ economic and financial terms, encouraging readers to study and master this foundational knowledge, enhancing their financial literacy. He believes financial literacy is a vital survival skill for modern individuals.\nTraits of Successful Stock Market Investors: These individuals perceive themselves as business owners, hold high-quality money, and excel at buying at low prices. The author emphasizes selecting quality company stocks for long-term holding, engaging with the company\u0026rsquo;s progress as if they were owners.\nDefining True Wealth: Genuine wealth encompasses owning a mortgage-free home, a steady stream of passive income, and the mentality of \u0026ldquo;not needing to work.\u0026rdquo; Kim recognizes that the standard of wealth is relative, and true wealth lies in inner freedom.\nDaily Habits for Wealth Protection: The author shares his routine of diligently reading news, scanning economic websites, and collecting information. He believes continuous learning and market awareness are crucial for maintaining investment sensitivity and making informed decisions.\nThe Harsh Realities of Poverty: Drawing from personal experience, Kim paints a grim picture of poverty, encouraging readers to believe in their potential for wealth. He underscores poverty\u0026rsquo;s power to strip dignity and even dismantle family relationships.\nThree Responses to Financial Panic: The author categorizes people\u0026rsquo;s responses to financial panics: those who suffer losses, those unaffected, and those who capitalize and profit. He analyzes the characteristics of each group, noting that individuals with no debt and stable income weather the storm while those who seize opportunities emerge wealthier.\nRewinding Time for Wealth: Reflecting on his experience, Kim encourages young people to start investing early and highlights the limitations of relying solely on bank savings. He suggests young people focus on long-term investments in quality company stocks instead of traditional bank savings.\nThe Foundation of Wisdom: Learning fundamental knowledge is a prerequisite for gaining wisdom. The author encourages young people to study languages and mathematics, cultivating logical thinking abilities. He believes learning new languages broadens horizons while studying mathematics sharpens logical reasoning.\nImmediate Action for Wealth: Drawing inspiration from Marie Kondo\u0026rsquo;s organizational methods, Kim recommends readers declutter their homes, fostering respect for possessions, and reflecting on their spending habits. He suggests that the way we treat possessions reflects our attitude towards money; respecting belongings leads to cherishing wealth.\nWill the Stock Market Rise?: Don\u0026rsquo;t obsess over short-term market fluctuations. Focus on long-term investment, select quality companies, and patiently wait for value to return. He advises readers to identify quality companies that warrant long-term investment and maintain unwavering confidence.\nUnlocking the Value of Rent Payments: Entrepreneurs consistently paying rent possess the capacity to purchase property. The author encourages them to become property owners and capitalize on the potential for greater returns. He emphasizes that rental income can translate into property appreciation, while property ownership offers greater security and returns.\nReal Estate vs. Stock Market: Instead of fixating on which market is superior, choose an investment approach aligned with your style and risk tolerance. Kim provides a comparative analysis of real estate and stock market investments, highlighting their unique features and potential risks.\nMy Independence Day: Using the concept of a personal \u0026ldquo;independence day\u0026rdquo; marked by financial independence, the author emphasizes the significance of economic self-reliance. He encourages readers to develop financial strategies and strive for early financial freedom, recognizing its role as a foundation for personal liberty.\nFour Skills of Money Management: Kim outlines four essential skills for managing money: earning, saving, preserving, and spending. He provides insights into the characteristics of each skill and recommends learning methods. He emphasizes that these are interconnected skills that need to be mastered for effective wealth management.\nInvesting with Values: The author shares his investment principles, avoiding industries that profit from misfortunes. He believes such money carries negative consequences and clashes with his values. He exemplifies this with businesses centered around firearms, cigarettes, and drugs.\nInsurance is not Savings: Kim criticizes the practice of insurance companies selling high-commission, low-return products disguised as savings. He advises readers to choose insurance primarily for its protection function, not as investment vehicles, and to select suitable products based on their individual needs.\nBeautiful Junk: Drawing from a luxurious travel experience, Kim conveys that experiences and memories are more valuable than material possessions. He urges readers to avoid accumulating \u0026ldquo;beautiful junk,\u0026rdquo; recognizing that many purchases become unused clutter, wasting both money and space.\nSeparating Economics from Political Bias: Readers are urged to approach economic news with a critical eye, avoiding interpretation solely from a political standpoint. Refer to factual data to form judgments. Kim suggests that many media reports are politically charged, encouraging independent thinking and caution against being swayed by media biases.\nPart 4: The Mindset and Responsibilities of the Wealthy # The Underdog Advantage: Using historical and business examples, the author illustrates that underdogs overcoming giants is a recurring theme. He encourages young people to embrace challenges and strive for success. He believes individuals from humble backgrounds often possess greater drive and innovation, enabling them to seize opportunities and achieve upward mobility. Your Personal PER: Kim introduces the concept of Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PER) and applies it to personal careers and businesses, reminding readers to focus on the stability and sustainability of income sources. He emphasizes that high income doesn\u0026rsquo;t equate to wealth; building systems that generate consistent income is crucial. Wealth Is Not Predestined: Great wealth arises from a combination of opportunities, hard work, intelligence, and luck, not from predetermined destiny. The author encourages readers to actively seek opportunities and prepare themselves, believing everyone holds the potential for success, provided they believe in themselves and strive diligently. Start Small, Dream Big: Young aspiring entrepreneurs are advised to gain experience and build connections by initially working in small companies. He believes small companies offer more opportunities for learning and practical experience, facilitating rapid growth. Perseverance is Power: The author emphasizes the importance of consistency and perseverance, advising readers to devote 100 days or three months to mastering a skill or forming a good habit. He believes persistence is key to success, as any skill requires continuous effort to achieve mastery. Limitless Business Opportunities: Kim encourages readers to think outside the box and be receptive to business opportunities. He shares his experience of launching a flower shop, demonstrating that opportunities are present in everyday life; a keen eye can unearth suitable ventures. Entrepreneurship: The Path to Freedom: Entrepreneurship is championed as the only profession offering genuine control over one\u0026rsquo;s destiny. The author encourages young people to pursue entrepreneurship, breaking free from the limitations of corporate employment. He highlights that entrepreneurship offers greater freedom, a sense of accomplishment, and the potential for significant wealth creation. Discerning the Nature of Money: Earn money of good character, avoiding ill-gotten gains from sources like gambling or fraud. Kim believes that good money brings blessings, while bad money carries misfortune, using examples of money obtained through gambling or fraud to illustrate the harmful effects of ill-gotten gains. Navigating Family Responsibilities as the Wealthiest Sibling: Kim shares guidance based on his own experience, recommending different strategies for supporting and caring for family members, depending on the scale of wealth. Under 100 Million Won: Prioritize women in the family who have contributed significantly but are often overlooked, such as sisters-in-law, along with nieces and nephews. Buy them gifts, cover family meal expenses, and provide regular financial support to parents. Avoid lending money to siblings for business ventures or assisting parents in upgrading their homes or cars. Under 500 Million Won: You can purchase a house or car for your parents, cover all their living expenses, and assist nieces and nephews with education costs. At this stage, you can offer measured support to siblings. Over 1 Billion Won: Actively help siblings escape poverty, select suitable siblings to participate in the management of family businesses, and lead the entire family to prosperity. The Right to Fail: Young people are encouraged to embrace challenges without fear of failure, viewing failure as a valuable learning opportunity. He believes failure is a precious life experience, making success more appreciated when achieved. Can Books Create Wealth?: Reading alone cannot make one wealthy; the key is to cultivate independent thinking and draw inspiration from books. He suggests reading with a discerning mind, applying what you learn to your own experiences. God\u0026rsquo;s Impartiality: God\u0026rsquo;s fairness lies in his non-intervention in earthly affairs. The author encourages readers to rely on their own efforts rather than placing their hope in divine intervention. He believes each individual is responsible for their own destiny and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t place their hopes solely on divine intervention. The Passionate Entrepreneur and His Furious Wife: A fictional story emphasizes the vital role of family harmony in business success, condemning the practice of prioritizing investments at the expense of family well-being. The story features an entrepreneur, Mr. Song, who runs a successful dessert shop and a barbecue restaurant. He pours all the profits back into developing new menu items and his research lab, leading to financial strain at home and his wife\u0026rsquo;s understandable frustration. Partnerships: A Delicate Dance: Kim outlines the conditions and considerations for successful partnerships, emphasizing the importance of respecting partners\u0026rsquo; money and drafting legally sound agreements. He believes that trust and respect are paramount in any partnership, and all aspects of the agreement should be clearly defined in writing to prevent future disputes. Stick to the Main Road: When investing in unfamiliar sectors, opt for companies that are industry leaders to mitigate risk. He compares investing in a leading company to navigating a well-defined road, reducing the risk of getting lost and generally offering greater security. The Quarter Rule: The author unveils his personal \u0026ldquo;Quarter Rule,\u0026rdquo; advocating for living expenses to be capped at one-quarter of one\u0026rsquo;s financial capacity. This strategy allows for enjoying life while maintaining a financial safety net. Prayers Alone Won\u0026rsquo;t Bring Riches: True wealth comes through hard work, wisdom, and seizing opportunities, not reliance on divine intervention or supernatural forces. While prayer might offer spiritual solace, it cannot replace action. Four Habits of Saving: Cultivate good habits early in life, starting with simple daily actions that lay a strong foundation for wealth accumulation. These habits are: stretching upon waking, making your bed, drinking a glass of water on an empty stomach each morning, and maintaining consistent sleep and wake times. III.

Summary # The central argument of the book is that financial success is less about IQ and more about how you behave. Author Morgan Housel argues that by understanding the common psychological pitfalls associated with money, we can make better decisions. He illustrates this through a series of compelling stories and case studies, shedding light on our financial decision-making process.\nII. Chapter Summaries # 1. No One\u0026rsquo;s Crazy\nPeople‚Äôs unique experiences shape their financial perspectives and actions, leading to seemingly irrational yet logically justifiable behaviors. For example, low-income individuals might be drawn to lotteries as their perceived only shot at a life-altering fortune. 2. Luck \u0026amp; Risk\nNothing is as good or as bad as it seems, as luck and risk play crucial roles in personal outcomes. Bill Gates getting into a high school with a computer was luck. His friend Kent Evans dying in a mountain climbing accident was risk. Recognizing the influence of luck and risk helps avoid over-attributing success or failure solely to personal effort or poor decisions. 3. Never Enough\nContentment is key in finance. The pursuit of \u0026ldquo;never enough\u0026rdquo; leads to a dangerous cycle of insatiable desire that can ultimately lead to ruin. Former McKinsey CEO Rajat Gupta and Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff are cited as examples of individuals who lost everything due to greed. 4. Confounding Compounding\nCompounding‚Äôs power lies in long-term accumulation, allowing even small gains to snowball into extraordinary results. Warren Buffett\u0026rsquo;s immense wealth is attributed not just to skilled investment but to 70 years of consistent investing, highlighting the power of time. 5. Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy\nGetting wealthy requires taking risks, while staying wealthy requires humility, frugality, and respecting the fleeting nature of good fortune. Trading legend Jesse Livermore, despite remarkable success, fell victim to overconfidence and excessive risk-taking, ultimately leading to bankruptcy and suicide. 6. Tails, You Win\nIn business and investing, \u0026ldquo;tail events\u0026rdquo; (rare, high-impact events) often disproportionately drive overall results. Walt Disney produced hundreds of films, but the success of a single one, Snow White, propelled his entire enterprise to unimaginable heights. 7. Freedom\nThe greatest dividend of wealth is the ability to control your time, offering the ultimate flexibility to pursue your passions and spend time with loved ones. 8. The Ferrari Fallacy\nPeople care less about your wealth than you think. Their attention is often directed towards their own desires and comparing themselves to you. 9. Wealth is What You Don\u0026rsquo;t See\nTrue wealth lies not in flashy possessions but in the unseen: financial security, flexibility, and the ability to make choices. 10. Save Money\nBuilding wealth hinges on your savings rate, which is driven by lifestyle choices and managing desires. 11. Reasonable \u0026gt; Rational\nIn financial decisions, making reasonable choices that you can stick with is often more effective than striving for absolute rationality. 12. Surprise!\nHistory is full of surprises, so relying solely on historical patterns to predict the future is unreliable. Recognizing the constant possibility of the unexpected is crucial. 13. Room for Error\nThe most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan: Building in a margin of safety is crucial. 14. You\u0026rsquo;ll Change\nOur goals, thoughts, and aspirations change over time. Acknowledging this is essential when making long-term financial plans. Avoid extreme financial goals, embracing the fluid nature of life. 15. Nothing\u0026rsquo;s Free\nEverything has a price. Success in investing comes with costs: volatility, fear, and uncertainty. Viewing these as fees for a valuable service rather than penalties to avoid helps navigate the emotional rollercoaster of investing. 16. No One\u0026rsquo;s Crazy (Reprise)\nAvoid blindly following financial advice from people with different circumstances and timelines than your own. 17. The Seduction of Pessimism\nPessimism often seems more intelligent and gains more attention, even though the world has generally improved significantly over time. 18. When You Believe Anything\nThe power of narratives shapes our beliefs. The more we want something to be true, the more likely we are to embrace narratives that inflate its likelihood, especially in high-risk, high-reward scenarios like investing. 19. Summary\nThis chapter provides a recap of the key principles and advice from previous chapters to guide sound financial decision-making. 20. Confessions\nThe author shares his own personal approach to money management, highlighting the importance of seeking financial independence and emphasizing long-term investing. Appendix: A Brief History of the American Consumer\nPost-WWII, the US deliberately engineered the American consumer through low-interest rates, consumer credit, and programs like the GI Bill, fostering a culture of consumption and economic growth. From the 1950s to the 1970s, income distribution remained relatively equitable, the debt was manageable, and confidence in a better future was high. The 1980s onwards witnessed growing income inequality. The aspirational lifestyles of a small group of prosperous individuals diverged drastically from those of the average person, fostering a culture of keeping up appearances, fueled by debt. The 2008 financial crisis, a culmination of a debt bubble, exposed the cracks in this system. Recent years have seen a rise in social unrest tied to income inequality, prompting individuals to question the current economic and social model. III. Memorable Quotes # \u0026ldquo;Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.\u0026rdquo;\nLife‚Äôs outcomes are influenced by chance and factors outside our control. This quote urges us to be mindful of the unpredictable nature of events. \u0026ldquo;The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.\u0026rdquo;\nContentment is essential for financial well-being. Constantly shifting financial goals in pursuit of \u0026ldquo;more\u0026rdquo; can become a destructive cycle. \u0026ldquo;The greatest dividend of wealth is the ability to control your time.\u0026rdquo;\nWealth allows us to free ourselves from time constraints, enabling us to spend our time as we see fit. \u0026ldquo;Wealth is what you don\u0026rsquo;t see.\u0026rdquo;\nTrue wealth resides in our ability to make choices and have options, not in material possessions. ‚ÄúSave Money. Just save.‚Äù\nSaving should be a default behavior, a fundamental habit for financial stability and future flexibility. ‚ÄúNo One‚Äôs Crazy (Reprise).‚Äù\nRecognize that financial advice must be individualized. Avoid mimicking strategies without considering personal circumstances and goals. IV. Practical Takeaways # Acknowledge your psychological biases ‚Äì Understand your weaknesses related to managing money and avoid impulsive decisions. View money as a tool, not an end goal ‚Äì Strive to use wealth as a means to achieve freedom and happiness, not to pursue material possessions.

It encourages readers to think like a \u0026ldquo;Renaissance person\u0026rdquo; by developing diverse skills and points out the challenges of implementing change.

The book encourages readers to break free from the limitations of \u0026ldquo;the system\u0026rdquo; and re-examine their lifestyles and values. (Example: The allegory of Plato\u0026rsquo;s Cave, illustrating how people are trapped in limited cognition and experience, mistaking shadows for reality).

It analyzes their financial characteristics, strengths, weaknesses, and interactions with \u0026ldquo;the system.\u0026rdquo; The concepts of financial coupling and job dependence are emphasized. The Renaissance Ideal: Explains the versatility and independence of the \u0026ldquo;Renaissance person\u0026rdquo; and contrasts it with the modern \u0026ldquo;system\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; emphasis on specialization.

Emphasizes how reducing dependence on products and services provided by \u0026ldquo;the system\u0026rdquo; can lower living costs and improve quality of life. (Examples: how to replace car ownership with walking, cycling, or other methods, how to repair and maintain items oneself, and how to reduce expenses through socializing and sharing resources). Conclusion: Summarizes the core ideas and encourages readers to break free from the constraints of \u0026ldquo;the system\u0026rdquo; to live more free and autonomous lives. III. Key Quotes # Independence is not something you have; it\u0026rsquo;s something you are.\nInsight: Independence is a way of thinking and behaving, not a state of being.\nYou cannot solve a problem with the same mindset that created it.\nInsight: Achieving financial independence requires a shift from a consumerist mindset to a creative problem-solving approach.\nBe the change that you wish to see in the world.\nInsight: Instead of complaining about the system, change yourself and your actions, and influence others by example.\nThe best prison has invisible bars.\nInsight: Modern society subtly confines us through social norms, consumerism, and the education system, making us unconsciously comply.\nIV.

Summary # This book reveals a financial secret that everyone can learn but is rarely taught in school: You don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a finance expert or a high-income earner to achieve financial freedom; prudent spending and rational investing are all it takes, even on a modest income.\nThe author, Andrew Hallam, is a high school English teacher who started investing at age 19 and became a millionaire by age 38. He distilled his years of investment experience and wisdom he garnered from numerous financial wizards into nine simple and actionable principles. Supported by factual cases and personal anecdotes, he guides readers step-by-step towards financial freedom.\nII. Chapter Summaries # Lesson One: Spend Like You Want to Grow Rich # Distinguish between \u0026ldquo;wants\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;needs\u0026rdquo;: Spend rationally, control unnecessary expenses, and avoid over-reliance on credit cards. Invest the money you save. Example: In his youth, the author lived an extremely frugal life to pay off his student loans as quickly as possible, succeeding within a year and subsequently investing all his income. How to buy a car for less: Opt for low-mileage, easy-to-resell used cars instead of blindly pursuing luxury vehicles. Example: The author purchased low-mileage used Japanese cars in his youth and sold them for the same or even higher price after a few years, turning a small profit. Buying a house: It\u0026rsquo;s not about the down payment, but the interest rate: Consider whether you can still afford the mortgage if the interest rate doubles to prevent financial strain due to rising rates. Start strong, don\u0026rsquo;t rely on a \u0026ldquo;rich dad\u0026rdquo;: Excessive financial support from parents can hinder a child\u0026rsquo;s ability to create wealth independently. Teach them financial knowledge and skills, letting them learn how to earn, save, and invest on their own. Example: Studies show that accountants who received financial assistance from their parents had 43% less average wealth than their self-made counterparts. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to live like a pauper, but spend like a millionaire: Frugality does not equate to a lower quality of life. It\u0026rsquo;s about investing the money you save, allowing it to work for you instead of the other way around. Lesson Two: Use the Greatest Investment Ally You Have # Leverage compound interest to accelerate wealth accumulation: The earlier you start investing, the longer the time horizon for compound interest to work its magic, leading to faster wealth growth. Example: Investing $45 per month for 40 years yields significantly higher returns than investing $800 per month for only 25 years. Buffett\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark Principle\u0026rdquo;: Invest early, just like Noah built the ark, don\u0026rsquo;t wait for the \u0026ldquo;flood\u0026rdquo; to arrive before taking action. What to do when you get paid: Keep track of your monthly expenses, calculate the amount available for investment, and transfer that money to your investment account on payday to avoid running out of funds at the end of the month. Example: A couple the author knew, both teachers, realized their wasteful spending habits after tracking their expenses for three months. They subsequently allocated more money to investment, tripling their investment amount within two years. The stock market doesn\u0026rsquo;t believe in tears, but it believes in time: In the long run, the stock market rises with corporate earnings growth. Therefore, be patient and don\u0026rsquo;t be intimidated by short-term market fluctuations. The author\u0026rsquo;s stock market investments from 1990 had increased tenfold by 2016. Example: Using Willy Wonka\u0026rsquo;s chocolate factory as an analogy, the author explains the fundamentals of stocks, share prices, dividends, and the stock market in a simple and engaging way, highlighting the substantial returns from long-term investment. Lesson Three: Small Fees Pack Big Punches # Index funds: the secret to effortless wealth generation: Index funds track a specific market index, holding all or most of the stocks in that index to achieve the same return as the market. Their advantages lie in low costs, risk diversification, and stable returns. \u0026ldquo;The Oracle of Omaha\u0026rdquo; buys index funds: Investment gurus like Warren Buffett, Paul Samuelson, and Daniel Kahneman all recommend index funds because they provide market-average returns at the lowest cost, outperforming the vast majority of actively managed funds over the long term. Example: Buffett suggests putting 90% of one\u0026rsquo;s funds into an ultra-low-cost S\u0026amp;P 500 index fund. 78% of active fund returns go to the advisors\u0026rsquo; pockets: The high fees (management fees, transaction costs, commissions, etc.) of actively managed funds will eat up most of the investors\u0026rsquo; gains. Generally, their returns underperform index funds over the long run. Example: The author\u0026rsquo;s wife could have earned an extra $20,000 if she had invested in index funds instead of actively managed funds, as recommended by her financial advisor, over the past five years. Don\u0026rsquo;t bother picking \u0026ldquo;top actively managed funds\u0026rdquo;: There is no reliable method to consistently pick actively managed funds that will outperform index funds. Even if a fund has a history of exceptional performance, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee future success. Their returns tend to revert to the average or lower in the long run. Example: Investors in Morningstar\u0026rsquo;s five-star-rated funds often experience lower long-term returns compared to index fund investors. \u0026ldquo;International citizens\u0026rdquo; should opt for index funds: Actively managed funds are significantly more expensive outside of the US. Therefore, \u0026ldquo;international citizens\u0026rdquo; should choose index funds to lower their investment costs. Lesson Four: Conquer the Enemy in the Mirror # Stay rational, earn 10% returns even in a bear market: Don\u0026rsquo;t let fear and greed dictate your investment decisions. Don\u0026rsquo;t panic sell in a falling market or chase rising prices in a bull market. Stick to regular investment and buy more cheap stocks in a bear market to achieve higher returns in the long run. Example: During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, investors who steadily invested in index funds at the lows ultimately reaped higher returns. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to time the market: No one can accurately predict short-term market trends; don\u0026rsquo;t try to beat the market by timing it. Market timing often causes you to miss the best investment opportunities, leading to lower investment returns. Earning 150%? Be wary of tech stocks: Don\u0026rsquo;t be fooled by high-growth, high-valuation stocks. Stock prices eventually revert to the level justified by corporate earnings. Blindly chasing hot stocks can easily lead to losing your entire investment. Example: The dot-com bubble burst in 1999, causing countless investors to suffer heavy losses. The author himself lost nearly half of his money due to investing in Nortel Networks stock. Falling stocks: a buying opportunity: A bear market is the best time to invest. Seize the opportunity to buy more cheap stocks when prices are low. In the long run, stocks rise with corporate earnings growth. Young people should be excited when stocks rebound: Young investors have more time to allow compound interest to work its magic. They should actually hope for market declines to buy more low-priced stocks. Over the long term, stocks bought at a discount offer higher returns. Lesson Five: Build Mountains of Money with a Responsible Portfolio # Buy bonds as insurance for your stocks: Bonds offer lower returns than stocks but have lower volatility, reducing the overall risk of your portfolio. They act as a buffer when the stock market falls. Short-term bonds: a safe haven for your money: Short-term bonds are less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and are more suitable as a \u0026ldquo;safety cushion\u0026rdquo; for your portfolio. Adjusting your portfolio to profit from market crashes: Determine the appropriate mix of stocks and bonds based on your age and risk tolerance. Rebalance your portfolio regularly (e.g., review it annually), selling bonds to buy stocks in a down market and selling stocks to buy bonds in a bull market. Example: Before the 2008 financial crisis, the author created a portfolio with a 35% bond allocation. During the downturn, he consistently increased his stock holdings. Consequently, he achieved higher returns when the market rebounded. \u0026ldquo;Globalize\u0026rdquo; your investment: Don\u0026rsquo;t limit yourself to the domestic market. Diversify your investments across the globe to further reduce risk and access a wider range of opportunities. \u0026ldquo;Lazy portfolio\u0026rdquo;: adjust once a year for annual returns: Allocate your portfolio equally between stocks and bonds, rebalance once a year. This simple strategy delivers impressive long-term returns without demanding excessive time or effort. Example: Following the \u0026ldquo;Lazy Portfolio\u0026rdquo; strategy allowed investors to achieve positive returns even during the 2008 financial crisis. Lesson Six: Sample a \u0026ldquo;Round-the-World\u0026rdquo; Ticket to Indexing # ETFs: Access Global Markets with One Account: Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a convenient way to invest in index funds. They are traded on stock exchanges like individual stocks and cover a wide array of global markets. How to buy ETFs?: The author details the steps involved in buying ETFs: opening a brokerage account, finding the ETF ticker symbol, determining the price per share, and setting the investment amount, etc. Limit orders vs. market orders: The author explains these two common ETF order types and recommends using limit orders to avoid losses due to price fluctuations. US Indexes: Strategic Allocation for Optimal Returns: For US investors, a portfolio split equally between a US stock market index, a global stock market index, and a US bond market index, with annual rebalancing, is recommended for stable long-term returns. Example: The author\u0026rsquo;s friend, Chris, following this approach, grew his portfolio by 73.09% in 10 years despite experiencing the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Canadian Indexes: Minimize Costs for Maximum Returns: Canadians can build a low-cost, diversified global portfolio using TD Bank\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;e-Series\u0026rdquo; index funds or ETFs. The author uses personal anecdotes to illustrate that Canadian financial advisors are more inclined to recommend actively managed funds while overlooking low-cost index funds. He uses the example of Air Force Technician, Felix, to demonstrate how investors can build a low-cost, diversified portfolio through TD\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;e-Series\u0026rdquo; index funds. UK Indexes: Avoid High Fees, Optimize your Portfolio: UK investors should be wary of high-fee index funds. Building a diversified portfolio using low-cost index funds or ETFs provided by Vanguard or iShares is recommended. The author cites Virgin Money as an example to demonstrate how high fees and tracking errors can significantly affect index fund returns. He then uses the case of software engineer, Paul, to illustrate how investors can utilize iShares and Vanguard ETFs to build a low-cost, diversified portfolio. Australian Indexes: Multi-Asset Portfolios, Lower Fees with Higher Investments: Australians can opt for Vanguard\u0026rsquo;s multi-asset LifeStrategy funds or utilize platforms like Stockspot and Ignition Wealth to build ETF portfolios. The author shares the story of Andy, a software developer, who uses the Nabtrade brokerage platform to buy ETFs and create a diversified index fund portfolio. Singapore indexes: Low cost, smart allocation: Singaporean investors should also be cautious of high-fee index funds. Building a diversified portfolio using low-cost ETFs offered by Vanguard is recommended, but it\u0026rsquo;s important to avoid ETFs traded on US exchanges to avert US estate taxes. The author utilizes the example of \u0026ldquo;Fundsupermart\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;S\u0026amp;P 500 index\u0026rdquo; fund to illustrate how high fees significantly impact long-term investment returns. He further uses the case of a professor couple to show how investors can construct a diversified portfolio using ETFs traded on Singaporean and Canadian exchanges, thus avoiding US estate taxes. Lesson Seven: No, You Don\u0026rsquo;t Have to Invest on Your Own # Why do index investors lag behind the index?: Many investors fall prey to their emotions, making irrational decisions during market fluctuations, or are swayed by investment predictions, ultimately hindering their returns. Example: Some investors panic sell during market downturns and chase rising prices in a bull market, resulting in returns far lower than the index itself. US Robo-Advisors: Let the Smart Investors \u0026ldquo;Win\u0026rdquo; Effortlessly: Robo-advisor platforms can help investors create and manage low-cost index fund portfolios, rebalancing them regularly, and preventing investors from damaging their accounts. Example: Vanguard\u0026rsquo;s Target Retirement Funds offer a one-stop solution at a very low cost, suitable for those who prefer a hands-off approach to investment. The author uses his wife as an example to highlight the advantages of Vanguard Target Retirement Funds: achieving positive returns even without investment knowledge. Vanguard\u0026rsquo;s Comprehensive Financial Advisory Services: Vanguard provides comprehensive financial planning services at a low cost, making it a good option for investors seeking professional advice. Investment Guidance Training Services: Mark Zoril of PlanVision offers training services that guide investors to open low-cost brokerage accounts and build their own index fund portfolios. Investment Enhancement Services: Scott Burns of AssetBuilder provides investment enhancement services, using Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA) index funds to help investors build a \u0026ldquo;Lazy Portfolio\u0026rdquo;. The author elaborates on DFA\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy: pursuing excess returns through small-cap and value stocks. Betterment, Rebalance IRA, SigFig, and Wealthfront: These companies also offer robo-advisory services, building and managing portfolios consisting of index funds or ETFs for investors. Canadian Robo-Advisors: Lower Cost and More Targeted: Robo-advisor platforms in Canada, such as WealthBar and Wealthsimple, offer lower-cost, personalized services, tailoring portfolios to suit client risk tolerance and investment goals. The author uses personal experiences to demonstrate that Canadian bank advisors still favor actively managed funds over low-cost index funds. Tangerine: Tangerine bank provides Canadian investors with a financial product that encompasses a diversified index fund portfolio. Low cost makes it suitable for those who prefer to invest small sums regularly. The author uses 19-year-old Katie as an example to show how young people can leverage Tangerine\u0026rsquo;s investment products for regular investing. WealthBar: WealthBar offers Canadian investors five portfolio management solutions and provides comprehensive financial planning based on their risk tolerance. UK Robo-Advisors: Diversified Index Fund Baskets: UK robo-advisor platforms, like Nutmeg, construct diverse index fund portfolios for investors, rebalancing regularly, although their fees are comparatively higher. Australian Robo-Advisors: Increasing Competition and Falling Fees: The Australian robo-advisor market is highly competitive with decreasing fees. Platforms like Stockspot and Ignition Wealth offer low-cost, personalized ETF portfolio management services. Singapore Robo-Advisors: Avoid \u0026ldquo;Suicidal\u0026rdquo; Asset Allocation: Singapore\u0026rsquo;s robo-advisory market is nascent. Investors should opt for companies that don\u0026rsquo;t utilize ETFs traded on US exchanges to avoid US estate tax liabilities. Lesson Eight: Peek Inside A Pilferer‚Äôs Playbook # Identifying Financial Advisors\u0026rsquo; Tricks: Financial advisors use various tactics to persuade investors to buy actively managed funds, such as claiming that \u0026ldquo;index funds are more dangerous during downturns\u0026rdquo; or that \u0026ldquo;index funds can only achieve average returns,\u0026rdquo; both of which are misleading. Examples: When the author and his friend sought advice from financial advisors, they were aggressively steered towards actively managed funds without mention of their high fees or lower returns. One advisor even claimed index funds were riskier and that actively managed funds were better suited for navigating bear markets. Index Fund Returns Outshine \u0026ldquo;Financial Elites\u0026rdquo;: Even seasoned investment professionals like pension fund managers struggle to beat index fund returns. Many pension funds have started shifting towards indexed investments, allocating a significant portion of their funds to index funds. Example: A study by US consulting firm FutureMetrics revealed that less than 30% of large corporate pension funds outperformed a diversified portfolio holding 60% S\u0026amp;P 500 index and 40% corporate bond index. Don\u0026rsquo;t Accidentally Become a \u0026ldquo;Second-Rate Investor\u0026rdquo;: Don\u0026rsquo;t be fooled by financial advisors\u0026rsquo; sales pitches. Trust the data and facts - index funds are the most reliable way to profit in the stock market. Advisors\u0026rsquo; interests are often at odds with those of their clients; they prioritize commission income over investor returns. Lesson Nine: Avoid Seduction # Stock Picking Scams: Do their stock recommendations really work?: Investment newsletter predictions are often inaccurate, and their recommended stocks are likely to lead to financial ruin. Their primary goal is to attract subscribers, not to help investors make money. Example: The author invested in stocks recommended by \u0026ldquo;The Gilder Technology Report\u0026rdquo; and suffered significant losses. The author of that report continues to publish similar reports, using the lure of high past returns to attract investors. Investing in Emerging Markets: Don\u0026rsquo;t be fooled by GDP: High economic growth does not necessarily translate into high stock market returns. Be cautious when investing in emerging markets. They are more volatile and risky, and their long-term returns may not surpass developed markets. Example: While China\u0026rsquo;s GDP grew rapidly from 2008 to 2016, its stock market performance was lackluster, with investors in a large-cap Chinese stock ETF experiencing a 30% loss. \u0026ldquo;Gold speculation\u0026rdquo;: It\u0026rsquo;s not investing: Gold has a low long-term return rate with high price volatility, making it unsuitable for long-term investment. \u0026ldquo;Gold speculators\u0026rdquo; attempt to profit from price differences by buying low and selling high, a risky strategy that cannot guarantee stable long-term returns. Example: $1 worth of gold purchased in 1801 would only be worth $73 in 2016, whereas a $1 investment in the US stock market during the same period would turn into $16.24 million. Investment Magazines: The Untold Truth: Investment magazines rely heavily on advertising revenue, leading them to cater to their advertisers rather than prioritize investors\u0026rsquo; needs. They often recommend high-fee actively managed funds while neglecting low-cost index funds. Example: In April 2009, \u0026ldquo;SmartMoney\u0026rdquo; magazine recommended bond funds and gold, ignoring the investment opportunity presented by low-priced stocks amidst the financial crisis. Hedge Funds: Picking the Pockets of the Rich: Hedge funds charge exorbitant fees and carry significant risks, with long-term returns that are often no better, and sometimes even worse, than index funds. Their reported performance is often skewed by \u0026ldquo;survivorship bias\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;backfill bias.\u0026rdquo; Example: Hedge funds struggle to achieve an average annual compounded return of even 1%. Only one out of the top 20 largest hedge funds has outperformed the S\u0026amp;P 500 index. Don\u0026rsquo;t buy currency-hedged ETFs: Currency-hedged ETFs aim to eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on investment returns. However, the hedging mechanism itself incurs costs, decreasing a portfolio\u0026rsquo;s returns. Example: Research indicates that non-currency-hedged ETFs generally outperform their currency-hedged counterparts over the long term. Don\u0026rsquo;t fall for smart beta funds: These hybrid funds fall somewhere between active and index funds, attempting to achieve excess returns with specific strategies. Their effectiveness is debated, and their fees are generally higher. Example: Studies show that the market capitalization growth of smart beta funds has been primarily due to valuation increases, not corporate earnings growth, suggesting potential decreases in future returns. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly buy into small-cap stocks: Small-cap stocks, those of smaller companies, offer high growth potential, but also carry higher risk. Investing in them requires careful consideration and risk tolerance; avoid chasing high returns blindly. III. Key Quotes # You don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a financial expert; even with a moderate income, you can achieve financial freedom through prudent spending and rational investing.\nThis encapsulates the core message of the book: financial management and investment are not exclusive to the wealthy; ordinary people can also achieve financial freedom through learning and practical application.\nTime is money.\nThis emphasizes that time is our most valuable asset. The earlier you start investing, the longer the time horizon for compound interest to work its magic, leading to faster wealth accumulation.\nA successful investor should follow two principles: the first is to never lose money and the second is to never forget the first principle.\nThis quote highlights the importance of risk management and capital preservation in investing.\nThe investor\u0026rsquo;s task is to focus on the horse, not the jockey.\nThis means that investors should prioritize a company\u0026rsquo;s intrinsic value over the fund manager\u0026rsquo;s individual ability. Over the long run, a company\u0026rsquo;s profitability is the most important factor determining its stock price.\nIf you plan to live off hamburgers for the rest of your life, but you don\u0026rsquo;t own any cattle, would you want beef prices to go up or down?\nBuffett used this analogy to illustrate that stocks represent ownership in a company. When share prices fall, long-term investors should view it as an opportunity to buy more shares.\nThe most insidious devil is the high cost associated with holding certain actively managed funds.\nThis quote emphasizes that investment costs are one of the most important factors affecting investment returns. Choosing low-cost index funds maximizes gains.\nHow much you can accumulate in your lifetime depends not on how much you can earn, but on how you invest. Money finds people more effectively than people find money. Let your money work for you, not the other way around.\nBuffett stresses the importance of investment and financial management, pointing out that wealth accumulation relies not only on income but also on how you manage and invest your money.\nToo much money can harm investment returns.\nThis seemingly paradoxical statement highlights a critical principle: avoid over-diversification and the blind pursuit of high returns. Concentrating your investments in a few high-quality assets and holding them for the long term often yields better results.\nIn stock investing, luck inevitably plays a role, but in the long run, good luck and bad luck offset each other. For sustained success, skills and sound principles are essential.\nThis emphasizes that the key to successful investing lies in mastering the correct investment philosophy and principles and adhering to them in the long term, rather than relying on luck.\nLet time and money work for you; you just need to sit back and wait for the results.\nThis emphasizes the power of long-term investment and compound interest. By choosing the right investment method and being patient, significant returns will follow.\nIV. Practical Implications # This book\u0026rsquo;s key takeaways include:\nDeveloping a sound financial mindset: Understand the importance of thrift, control unnecessary spending, and invest your savings.

Main Topic # The theme of this session is Embrace the New Bull Market and Invest Long-Term. James believes that the global monetary easing policy and the rapid development of AI technology herald the arrival of a new bull market. He advises everyone to invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ or 00662) and view market fluctuations with a long-term perspective.\nII. Content Summary # A new bull market is coming: The world has entered an era of loose monetary policy with the start of a rate cut cycle, which will drive the stock market up. This bull market may be a slow one but will continuously rise. Invest confidently in the Nasdaq 100 index fund: QQQ could increase by 50 times in the next 20 years, with an annualized return of over 20%, making it the best investment target. Individual stocks are unreliable: Individual stock investment is risky, and in the long run, almost all of them will disappear. They are very difficult to outperform the market in the long term. It is recommended not to waste time and energy on stock selection. Do not invest in the Chinese stock market: The Chinese stock market is not mature enough; consider investing in it after 30 years. Comparison of household asset allocation in the US and Taiwan: American families invest most of their assets in securities to create social value, while Taiwanese families prefer cash, insurance, and real estate, locking up funds in non-appreciating areas. Leveraging through stock pledges: Using stock pledges to borrow increases liquidity and allows for continued investment to enjoy the benefits of compound growth. With an understanding of asset allocation, the interest cost of borrowing can be almost negligible. Plan for retirement early: Young people are advised to invest in 00662, and retirees can choose 00646 (SPY) or 0056 according to their fund size. Emphasize family education: Parents should cultivate their children\u0026rsquo;s financial management concepts from an early age, guide them to make long-term investments, stay away from bad habits such as short-term speculation and gambling, and lead by example. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly trust high-yield investment products: Any investment product promising high returns may be a scam. It is important to understand its operating mechanism and learn to discern between true and false. The dangers of short-term trading: Short-term trading will miss the best investment opportunities. Long-term investment in index funds will yield more stable returns. The purpose of cash allocation: It is not for profit, but for dealing with emergencies like unemployment or a market crash. It is advisable to keep more than 10% of your assets in cash. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Retired Doctor Poch:\nSharing: After learning about James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy, he found a more relaxing and suitable investment method. Question: How to obtain a stable cash flow after retirement? Is it necessary to adjust the investment strategy of 00662? Answer: The investment target can be adjusted according to the size of the retirement fund. Choose 00646 (SPY) or 0056 with lower volatility to guarantee cash flow. IM:\nSharing: He tried to guide his child to invest by matching contributions and increased his vigilance against high-yield traps. Question 1: How to guide a child to invest and prevent them from spending investment income? Answer: Emphasize that investment is a long-term behavior. Income cannot be withdrawn for consumption. Funds should grow continuously through compound interest. Question 2: How to choose a safe and reliable trust company? How to avoid the traps of high-yield trust products?

Rose:\nSharing: She frankly talked about her past investment failures and the process of gradually establishing the correct investment concept under the guidance of James. Question 1: What are the differences and pros and cons of Margin Loan and Pledge Loan? The interest rate of Margin Loan from IB is relatively low. Is it necessary to transfer to Charles Schwab for Pledge Loan? Answer: Margin Loan is riskier, and Pledge Loan is relatively safe. If the interest rate of IB\u0026rsquo;s Margin Loan is low, you can continue to use it, but pay attention to controlling the borrowing ratio, preferably no more than 20%. Question 2: The return on cash allocation will decrease in the interest rate cut cycle. Is it still necessary to allocate cash? Answer: The purpose of cash allocation is not for profit but to deal with contingencies, such as unemployment or a market crash. It is advisable to keep more than 10% of your assets in cash. Question 3: How to manage children\u0026rsquo;s investment accounts? Under whose name should it be, yours or the child\u0026rsquo;s?

Estate planning can be done after the child becomes an adult. Phoenix:\nSharing: He shared his confusion about handling company stock options and finally adopted James\u0026rsquo; suggestion. Question 1: How to deal with the stock options of unlisted companies? Answer: If the company has a high possibility of going public, it is recommended to sell it to an investment company before the listing to get cash and invest in QQQ. Question 2: What do you think of Bitcoin? Can I invest in it? Answer: If you already hold a small amount of Bitcoin, you can continue to hold it, but do not invest any more capital. It is recommended to focus on investing in QQQ. Allen:\nSharing: He shared his questions about 401k and stock investment and eventually made adjustments under James\u0026rsquo; advice.

Answer: Investing in QQQ is recommended because it has higher long-term returns and is more flexible. Question 2: How to do estate planning? Answer: For larger estates, it is recommended to set up an irrevocable trust and consult an estate lawyer for planning. Kevin:\nSharing: Frankly admitted his past investment failures and regained confidence under the guidance of James, starting to embark on the road of steady investment.

Main Topic # This episode primarily discusses proper investment philosophy, ways to avoid investment traps, and the implications of China\u0026rsquo;s latest economic policies for the global market. James emphasizes the importance of long-term investment in index funds, particularly QQQ, and reminds investors to maintain emotional control and not be swayed by market fluctuations. He uses specific examples and data to illustrate the concept of \u0026ldquo;borrow for consumption, invest for asset growth,\u0026rdquo; while also analyzing China\u0026rsquo;s recently introduced series of economic stimulus policies, believing them to be a positive signal for a global economic recovery.\nII. Briefing Content # Investment Philosophy: Emotions are the biggest enemy in investing. You need to avoid being influenced by news and information, stay rational, and refrain from chasing rising or falling markets. Investing requires a long-term perspective, aiming for a timeframe of 40 years or more. Warren Buffett acquired 99% of his wealth after the age of 50, demonstrating that patience is key to wealth creation. Choose investment targets that are consistently stable and provide high returns. Index funds are the best option, especially QQQ, which boasts a long-term annualized return of 14%. Adhere to the \u0026ldquo;never sell\u0026rdquo; strategy to allow assets to continue appreciating. Avoid selling stocks unless absolutely necessary. Scam Avoidance Guide: Be wary of various investment traps. Do not trust any projects that guarantee high returns, especially those that require you to sell existing assets for new investments. Do not readily believe any investment or financial management information received via phone, text messages, or online platforms. Any information involving bank accounts or government departments must be verified through official channels. Be cautious of aggressive sales tactics from financial institutions. Stick to your investment plan and avoid being lured by various fancy financial products. Regarding Real Estate Investment: James advises against homeownership for average working individuals, believing it turns them into \u0026ldquo;mortgage slaves\u0026rdquo; burdened with heavy loan pressure, hindering wealth accumulation. He advocates for a \u0026ldquo;rent instead of buy\u0026rdquo; approach, suggesting using a stock pledge loan to rent high-quality housing at lower interest rates, then investing the saved funds for higher returns. Consider purchasing real estate only when your assets reach a certain scale and you can comfortably afford the payment. New Trends in China\u0026rsquo;s Economy: The People\u0026rsquo;s Bank of China recently introduced a series of potent fiscal policies, including reserve requirement ratio and interest rate cuts, injecting funds into banks, and encouraging stock purchases, to stimulate economic growth. These policies will contribute positively to stabilizing China\u0026rsquo;s real estate market, boosting consumer confidence, and promoting global economic recovery. Investors should pay attention to developments in the Chinese market and seize new investment opportunities. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IM:\nSharing: Through conversations with individuals of different age groups, IM discovered that most people have insufficient awareness of long-term savings and are often constrained by mortgages and other factors. By comparing the returns of index funds in different countries and regions with those of fixed deposits and pensions, IM illustrated the advantages of long-term investment in index funds. INGYNYING:\nSharing: INGYNYING\u0026rsquo;s mother wanted to sell all her assets to purchase a house but, after persuasion, realized that this would lead to losing opportunities for asset appreciation. Many of INGYNYING\u0026rsquo;s friends are afraid of change, preferring to endure the hardships of their current situation rather than attempt new investment methods. Question: How to convince family members to accept new investment concepts? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Utilize data and case studies for illustration, such as comparing the long-term returns of fixed deposits and index funds, and sharing success stories of investors. It\u0026rsquo;s also important to respect family members\u0026rsquo; choices and refrain from forcing them to accept new ideas. Allen:\nQuestions: Should someone with assets worth 50 times their annual living expenses use their salary to pay for a car? How can a couple combine their stock accounts for collateral purposes? James\u0026rsquo; answer: It is recommended to utilize Tesla\u0026rsquo;s official website loan to purchase a vehicle, then use funds from a stock pledge loan to repay the car loan. Dedicate your salary entirely to investment. Couples can combine their accounts through a joint account for collateral, sharing the limit, while their accounts remain individually managed. Eric:\nQuestion: Eric\u0026rsquo;s mother is visiting the US and is concerned about medical expenses. How should this be handled? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Purchasing travel insurance is advised, but excessive worry is unnecessary. Most non-emergency situations can be treated back home. If encountering extremely high medical costs, attempting negotiation with the hospital or seeking alternative solutions is possible. Due to the specific circumstances of foreign nationality and lack of income, the hospital may choose not to pursue the medical expenses. Dean:\nSharing: Dean purchased a new car using Tesla\u0026rsquo;s website loan and a stock pledge loan, conserving a significant amount of capital. Learning about investing boosted Dean\u0026rsquo;s confidence to decline a high-paying job and choose to stay home with their child. Michael:\nQuestions: How to secure a loan from Tesla\u0026rsquo;s official website for a car purchase? Can funds from 401k or IRA accounts be used for collateral? What are the options if QQQ is not available in their company\u0026rsquo;s 401k plan? James\u0026rsquo; answer: To apply for a car loan through Tesla\u0026rsquo;s website, choose the desired model and configuration, click \u0026ldquo;Order Now\u0026rdquo;, and select \u0026ldquo;Finance\u0026rdquo;. Funds in retirement accounts cannot be used as collateral; it is recommended to transfer part of those funds to a brokerage account for collateral purposes. Alternative options include choosing an S\u0026amp;P 500 index fund or inquiring with the company about the possibility of Blockage Link to invest in QQQ. EVA:\nQuestion: As a single, middle-aged woman with limited savings, how to balance work and investment? Should selling the house be considered for investment purposes? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Continue working diligently while consistently making monthly investments. Even small amounts will accumulate over 8-9 years, reaching the threshold for collateral, allowing you to leverage and accelerate wealth growth. Selling a house for investment is an option but requires careful consideration based on personal circumstances. If renting is more cost-effective, choose to rent and allocate the funds to investments yielding higher returns. Jenny:\nQuestions: Any knowledge regarding the latest Roth SEP IRA policy? James\u0026rsquo; answer: The policy information is quite recent, and the accuracy of the $69,000 limit requires verification. Consulting with professionals like a financial advisor at Chase or Lisa is recommended. As it is a new product, not all institutions may offer it. Sharing: Jenny shared a personal experience of being scammed, reminding everyone to exercise caution and avoid trusting any investment information, particularly those spread through unofficial channels. Haoqing:\nSharing: Haoqing relayed the experiences of close friends falling victim to scams, lamenting that scam tactics are constantly evolving and are hard to guard against, even for highly educated individuals. Question: How can investment concepts be better conveyed to people around us to prevent them from being deceived? Is there a need to explain professional investment knowledge? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Avoid explaining intricate investment knowledge; simply emphasize the core principle of long-term investment in index funds. Excessive professional details may confuse them, making them more susceptible to being misled by other investment information and ultimately falling prey to scams. Jason:\nSharing: Recounted an NFT scam incident encountered on Clubhouse, warning everyone to be wary of risks in the cryptocurrency world. Expressed gratitude toward James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy for helping them avoid such traps. Amy:\nSharing: Amy shared personal encounters with scams, including impersonations of government departments and courier companies. She emphasized the importance of relying only on written communication and ignoring any investment information delivered through phone calls or text messages. Amy suggested that, when in doubt, contact official channels for clarification. Becky:\nSuggestion: Avoid answering calls from unfamiliar numbers, set up spam filters, and use a less important email address when necessary to share personal information to minimize the risk of scams. Mike:\nQuestion: What are your thoughts on China\u0026rsquo;s most recent economic policies? Are they sustainable? James\u0026rsquo; answer: The People\u0026rsquo;s Bank of China has introduced powerful policies that are having a positive impact on economic confidence. Investors should keep an eye on these developments. Although the policies appear to be heading in a positive direction, their sustainability remains to be seen. Julia:\nQuestion: Any updates on the Roth SEP IRA policy? Are there any financial institutions already offering related products? James\u0026rsquo; answer: The policy information is fairly new, and the $69,000 limit\u0026rsquo;s accuracy is debatable. Consulting with a professional is advised. Being a new product, not all institutions might offer it yet. IV. Noteworthy Points # ‚ÄúYou have enough money when you have enough.\u0026quot; \u0026ndash; Many people\nMany individuals believe that having just enough to get by is sufficient. This is a mistaken notion, as money is never truly enough. True financial freedom lies in possessing the power of choice ‚Äì going wherever you want, doing whatever you desire ‚Äì instead of being constrained by finances.\n\u0026ldquo;Never borrow money for investments.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; Many people\nMany believe that borrowing for investment is unwise; however, this viewpoint is overly cautious. True investors, like Warren Buffett, skillfully leverage debt. Following the principle of \u0026ldquo;borrow for consumption, invest for asset growth\u0026rdquo;, the correct approach is to use borrowed money for expenses and personal money for investment. This enables rapid wealth accumulation.\n‚ÄúAll investment information received through phone calls, text messages, or online platforms is not trustworthy.‚Äù \u0026ndash; James\nNowadays, numerous scams operate through these channels. It\u0026rsquo;s crucial to exercise caution and avoid blindly believing any financial advice or information. Anything involving bank accounts or government departments must be verified through official sources. Additionally, seeking guidance from qualified professionals is essential.\n‚ÄúInvestment must be consistently stable over the long term, which is why index funds are the only viable option.\u0026quot; \u0026ndash; James\nWithin the complex investment landscape, index funds stand out as a few reliable options capable of offering consistent stability and high returns. Index funds are like living organisms; they will never die, whereas all individual stocks will eventually disappear within a century. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for generational wealth, index funds are the way to go.\nV. Summary # This episode is packed with valuable information and insights. It not only reiterates the importance of long-term index fund investment but also offers practical tips on scam prevention and provides an in-depth analysis of China\u0026rsquo;s newest economic policies. It is recommended to apply this knowledge to your investment practices and strive for financial freedom.\nDisclaimer: This article serves solely as personal study notes and does not constitute any investment advice.

Topic of the Session # The session centered on the core principle of long-term investment strategies. James reiterated his investment philosophy: \u0026ldquo;Buy QQQ whenever you have money and hold it for the long term.\u0026rdquo; The discussion expanded to cover aspects like investment philosophy, risk management, and values, incorporating current events and questions from attendees. James also shared insights from legendary investors like Warren Buffett, encouraging attendees to cultivate a sound investment mindset.\nII. Briefing Highlights # Buying at the Dip vs. Buying When You Have Money: James cited research from ChatGPT, indicating that even with the ability to accurately predict and buy at market dips, the long-term returns differed minimally compared to simply buying when one has available funds. Over a 20-year period, the difference was merely 8%, translating to a difference in annualized returns of less than 0.2%. Hence, rather than expending time and effort predicting market bottoms, it\u0026rsquo;s more effective to seize opportunities and buy QQQ when you have the money. Risks of Leveraged Funds: Using the 2000 tech bubble as an example, James explained how leveraged funds can accelerate losses in bear markets, potentially leading to devastating financial setbacks, even bankruptcy. He simulated a scenario where an investor repeatedly buys more leveraged funds as the market declines, culminating in financial ruin. This served as a cautionary tale against the \u0026ldquo;buy the dip\u0026rdquo; strategy with leveraged funds, emphasizing the importance of risk management. Keys to Investment Success: James emphasized that the key to successful investment lies in overcoming human weaknesses. Maintaining a detached and \u0026ldquo;unfeeling\u0026rdquo; attitude towards invested capital and short-term market fluctuations is crucial for adhering to a long-term investment approach. Market Cycles: James stated he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t teach attendees about predicting market cycles or any trading techniques. He considers these unimportant and prone to misinterpretation and misapplication, potentially leading to increased risks. He advocated for a long-term investment strategy, likening it to riding a cable car, a smooth and steady ascent to the summit of financial success. Money and Values: Acknowledging that individuals have different values regarding money, James advised understanding and respecting diverse values, discouraging attempts to impose one\u0026rsquo;s own values upon others. He used the example shared by an attendee about a mother preferring a financial subsidy over a family trip to illustrate the diverse ways people assign value to things. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IIM:\nShared: A story about a deceased friend, leading to reflections on money and values, and expressing confusion about balancing personal values with those of others. Question 1: How to understand some people\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;frugality\u0026rdquo; with money while being \u0026ldquo;generous\u0026rdquo; towards their pets. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: People manage their finances differently based on what they consider important and valuable. What might be significant to one person may hold little value for another. Question 2: How to understand a mother who prioritizes money over a family trip? How to better understand the needs of others? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This mother might have certain unmet needs, possibly requiring material security before pursuing leisurely experiences. Understanding true needs involves offering more choices (e.g., money plus a trip). Avoid trying to change others\u0026rsquo; values; focus on understanding and respecting them. Brian:\nShared: Encountering a friend who suggested leveraging to purchase Nvidia stock, leading to questions about investment advice. Question: How to evaluate investment advice received from others? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The validity of investment advice depends on individual judgment and risk tolerance. It\u0026rsquo;s important to avoid blindly following the advice of others and to think independently. Iny:\nShared: Experiencing a sense of calm and reduced anxiety after adopting James\u0026rsquo;s investment approach. This newfound peace of mind allows for dedicating more time to important matters like family, and interestingly, focusing on work has led to increased income. Question: How to understand the phenomenon of increased income resulting from a dedicated focus on work? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This exemplifies the principle that altruism ultimately benefits oneself. By focusing on serving clients and enhancing product or service quality, one ultimately gains client recognition and rewards, leading to higher income and a sense of accomplishment. Haoqing:\nShared 1: An experience with check fraud, prompting concerns about bank security and the risks of using checks. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Banks do not verify the identity of check depositors. Checks present security vulnerabilities, making it advisable to use safer online banking and digital payment methods like Apple Pay. Shared 2: Thoughts on the decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia, attributing this to factors like US regulations, labor laws, and unions. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia are multifaceted issues stemming from a complex interplay of factors, including national policies, labor laws, and unions. While Asian countries might resort to suppressing labor rights and environmental regulations to gain a competitive edge, the US places a higher value on worker well-being and environmental protection. This divergence in values contributes to different developmental paths. Becky:\nShared: Based on personal experience working in a digital payment company, Becky recommended that everyone stop using checks due to inherent security risks. Digital payment methods offer greater security and convenience, with features such as spending alerts that enable prompt response and recovery in case of issues. Mike:\nShared: As a long-time follower of James, Mike witnessed the evolution of his investment philosophy, from initially holding 30% SPY to converting to 100% QQQ, and eventually incorporating leveraged funds. He also shared personal investment experiences, like selling NIO and allocating a portion of his portfolio to private market investments. Question 1: Is investing in Intel after its acquisition worthwhile? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: James advised against investing in large companies that are acquisitive. Acquisitions often lack efficiency, posing integration challenges and potentially hindering productivity. While acquiring smaller companies for technological advantages makes sense, acquiring large companies is akin to amassing a pile of scrap metal. Question 2: How to view the supply chain security concerns stemming from the US outsourcing 3C product manufacturing, citing examples like the BBB Call explosion and walkie-talkie incidents? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Espionage is ubiquitous, and supply chain security is just one facet of this broader issue. Governments might implant spy codes in chips and software for surveillance purposes. Explosions are a relatively rudimentary form of espionage; more sophisticated methods can be extremely difficult to detect and prevent. Question 3: Is it possible to offer advanced courses for more experienced attendees? He suggested using portfolio sharing as a means to differentiate attendees\u0026rsquo; learning progress. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: James stated he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t differentiate between attendees nor offer advanced courses. Assessing whether a student is genuinely learning is primarily based on their attitude, not investment returns or holding duration. Even portfolio sharing can\u0026rsquo;t truly gauge learning progress. James mentioned his personal sensitivity to words and language, enabling him to discern learning attitudes from attendees\u0026rsquo; emails and the way they pose questions. IV. Noteworthy Insights # The best time to buy is when you have money. \u0026ndash; James\nMany obsess over finding the perfect entry point, but research indicates that even if you could perfectly time market dips, the long-term returns barely differ from simply buying when funds are available. Instead of wasting time trying to predict the market, seize the opportunity and act promptly.\nTo succeed in investing, you must be indifferent to the money you invest and the fluctuations in stock prices. \u0026ndash; James\nOvercoming the human tendency to fixate on money and fear short-term market swings is essential for maintaining a long-term investment strategy and achieving stable returns.\nTo achieve effortless investing, you need to be numb to money. \u0026ndash; James\nWhen investing becomes a habit, free from emotional impulses and external distractions, you can achieve optimal results.\nThe concept of a \u0026ldquo;benefactor\u0026rdquo; is relative. \u0026ndash; James\nPeople perceive and absorb information differently. Who you consider a benefactor might not be perceived as such by others.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t try to change other people\u0026rsquo;s values. \u0026ndash; James\nEveryone has their own values and ways of life. It\u0026rsquo;s important to understand and respect diverse choices.\nEspionage is everywhere. \u0026ndash; James\nInformation security is a growing concern. Be vigilant and protect your personal data.\nAcquisitions of large companies are generally inefficient, and leaders who are fond of acquisitions usually have inflated egos. \u0026ndash; James\nIntegration complexities and high management costs associated with mergers often outweigh the benefits gained.\nThe US excels in areas such as finance and technology design, while Asian countries can only substitute and supplement in specific aspects. \u0026ndash; Haoqing\nWithin the global division of labor, different countries have distinct strengths and weaknesses, leading to divergent paths of development.\nThe best judgments are validated by facts. \u0026ndash; Mike\nThe success of an investment philosophy is ultimately determined by its long-term returns, not short-term fluctuations or gut feelings.\nYour attitude determines my response. \u0026ndash; James\nJames adjusts his responses based on the learning attitude of the attendees. Attendees who are truly dedicated to learning will receive greater guidance.\nInvesting in individual stocks will ultimately lead to bankruptcy; holding onto individual stocks will also ultimately lead to bankruptcy.\n\u0026ndash; James\nCompanies have lifecycles. Holding onto a single stock long term significantly increases the risk of encountering bankruptcy. Diversification is key in investing.\nV. Summary # This live session once again emphasized the importance of long-term investing while reminding attendees to stay rational, patient, and vigilant. James addressed attendees\u0026rsquo; questions regarding investment strategies, risk management, and the relationship between money and values, sharing personal experiences and insights. Key takeaways include avoiding market timing, leveraged funds, and individual stock investments, and embracing an attitude of indifference towards money. Attendees actively shared their own investment experiences and reflections, prompting deeper contemplation on investment, money, life, and more.

Theme of the Episode # The theme of this episode is \u0026ldquo;Investing and Financial Management, Wealth is a Gift.\u0026rdquo; The core viewpoints are: Wealth is innate, but one must be informed to realize it; investing and financial management is an important way to accumulate wealth; index investing is an effective method to achieve long-term stable growth; rational asset allocation and risk control are the keys to investment success; and overcoming psychological barriers in investment and solidifying the long-term investment philosophy are crucial to ultimately achieving financial freedom.\nII. Summary of the Briefing # Wealth is a Gift: Wealth is innate, and being informed of this fact makes a huge difference. While successful entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are a minority, most people need to be told that \u0026ldquo;wealth is a gift,\u0026rdquo; and they need to learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth. The Power of Index Investing and Compound Interest: Index investing is an effective way to achieve long-term stable returns, and its compounding effect is astonishing. For example, investing $1,500 per month for 40 years with a 14% annualized return will yield $2.6 million. Even small amounts of money can accumulate considerable wealth through consistent long-term investment. High Risk, High Return?: High risk doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily lead to high returns. Whether you can bear the risk determines whether you can ultimately achieve high returns. Don\u0026rsquo;t overestimate your risk tolerance. Your risk appetite should be determined by an asset allocation that you can withstand even if your investment goes to zero. For example, if you cannot afford the risk of TQQQ going to zero, you should not invest in TQQQ. Choosing Investment Targets: It is recommended to invest in the global Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ). Those with insufficient funds or who are already retired can consider investing in SPY or high-dividend ETFs. Avoid investing in individual stocks because they tend to disappear over the long term, while index funds can continue to exist. The half-life of individual stocks is 10 years; out of 100 stocks, there may be less than three left after 50 years. Investment Mindset: The market will eventually rise, and investment requires patience. Always stay optimistic, even if the investment goes to zero. Learning about investing and financial management requires continuous thinking, like peeling an onion, layer by layer, to elevate the energy of the spiritual level. Investing is like the Yellow Mountain, eternally unchanging, yet different every day; every learning experience will bring new insights. Asset Allocation: Asset allocation is like building a house; it is a big project that requires comprehensive planning, not something simple. It is necessary to consider many factors, such as whether you are retired, your age, income, debt, and cash flow, to formulate a reasonable asset allocation plan. You need to carefully study the articles and videos on asset allocation provided by James to develop a plan that suits you. Do Not Blindly Trust External Information: Financial professionals often only consider their interests, so do not easily believe their advice. Think independently, study carefully, and do not be swayed by external information and noise. Most of the outside information is garbage; do not be affected by it, focus on learning James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy. Balancing Risk and Reward: Do not excessively pursue high returns or completely risk-free investments; balance risk and reward. Avoid changing investment strategies easily to prevent additional costs due to frequent trading. James\u0026rsquo; investment methods can guarantee asset appreciation and relative safety, avoiding extreme situations. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IM:\nSharing: Learning about investment is like peeling an onion; at first, the amount of information is overwhelming, but as you learn more, you will gradually understand the core idea and ultimately reach the realm of \u0026ldquo;the great Dao is simple.\u0026rdquo;\nQuestion 1: What do you think about the idea that \u0026ldquo;investing is simple\u0026rdquo;?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: Such views often mistake ignorance for inaction and do not truly understand the complexity and risks of investment. Question 2: How should we communicate with friends who don\u0026rsquo;t understand index investing?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: You can start by briefly introducing the concept and advantages of index investing and suggest that they watch related videos to learn. Don\u0026rsquo;t force them to accept it, everyone has their own choices. Just like preaching, we can only try our best to spread the message; whether it\u0026rsquo;s ultimately accepted depends on the individual. LAN:\nQuestion 1: How to calculate Beta? What is the actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: You can refer to the link to the article on Beta calculation on the message board. The actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF may deviate from the theoretical value due to factors such as market volatility and friction costs. When market volatility is large, the wear and tear of leveraged ETFs will be more serious, resulting in an actual Beta value lower than the theoretical value. Question 2: Why is there a huge difference in final return between scenario 3 and scenario 4.1 in the 005 topic?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: Scenario 4.1 is where no money is withdrawn from the investment, so the final return will be higher. Question 3: How to adjust Beta in a rising market?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: The adjustment of Beta should be determined by your own risk tolerance, not by the market trend. Do not try to predict the market, just keep a fixed Beta value. Question 4: For investments in Taiwan, should I choose Q2D or 00670L?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: 00670L is recommended because it includes New Taiwan dollar hedging, which can reduce the risk caused by exchange rate fluctuations. Don\u0026rsquo;t change investment targets frequently, choose one that suits you and hold it for the long term. Nai Xin:\nSharing: Wealth is a gift, just as self-confidence is a gift; everyone has potential, but it needs to be stimulated. The key to investing and financial management lies in learning. Once you have mastered the correct investment method, you can focus on your own career and life and let wealth grow naturally over time. Overcome fear, build confidence, and you can realize your potential, gain wealth, and achieve success. Jason:\nSharing: Understanding \u0026ldquo;buy whenever you have money,\u0026rdquo; but still finding it difficult to overcome psychological fluctuations when the market rises or falls sharply. James\u0026rsquo; Response: Overcoming psychological fluctuations takes time and experience. You can try to make a small number of trades, experience the impact of market fluctuations, and gradually adapt to market changes. IM Supplement: You can overcome psychological barriers by imagining starting to invest two years later and understanding that \u0026ldquo;money arrives at different points in time.\u0026rdquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about buying at the lowest point; as long as you stick to long-term investment, you can get good returns. Hai Rui Ji:\nSharing:\nThank you James for selflessly sharing your investment philosophy; students learn from each other and make progress together. James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy requires continuous learning and understanding to grasp it fully. \u0026ldquo;Never sell\u0026rdquo; does not mean you cannot sell, but that you should develop a reasonable investment strategy based on your own situation. ** \u0026ldquo;Never sell\u0026rdquo; refers to mentally ignoring market fluctuations and adhering to a long-term investment philosophy.** Investment philosophy needs to keep pace with the times and adjust investment strategies according to changes in the environment. Question: Already answered in the video.\nLi Zi:\nSharing: To overcome psychological barriers to investment, manage accounts separately, using one part for long-term investment and the other for tentative operations, such as selling covered calls. This satisfies the desire to trade and avoids losses due to frequent trading. James\u0026rsquo; Response: You only know what is best after you have experienced it. Experience in trading can lead to a firmer commitment to a long-term investment strategy. Trying different trading strategies can help you understand the advantages of long-term investment and ultimately achieve the state of \u0026ldquo;daily reduction for the Dao.\u0026rdquo; T:\nQuestion 1: Why has the capital market in mainland China performed poorly for a long time?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: Emerging markets take time to mature. The Chinese market is like the Taiwanese market 50 years ago. It has the potential to rise in the long term, but its return may be lower than that of the US market. Investment should focus on sustainable development markets. The US market has advantages in terms of systems and industries. Question 2: Under foreign exchange control, how do I invest in US index funds? Are there any risks?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: You can invest by purchasing ETFs listed in China that track US index funds, such as 513100. Foreign exchange controls mainly restrict the physical flow of funds, and buying ETFs is not restricted. The current scale of such investment is small and will not trigger a quota limit. Even with foreign exchange control, it is still possible to allocate global assets through legal channels. IV. Key Takeaways # Wealth is a Gift \u0026ndash; James\nEveryone has the potential for wealth, but they must be informed to realize it and learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth.\nLearning Increases Daily, the Dao Decreases Daily \u0026ndash; IM\nLearning about investing and financial management is a process of continuous improvement. At first, you will be exposed to a large amount of information, but as your understanding deepens, you will gradually simplify your investment strategy and eventually reach the state of \u0026ldquo;the great Dao is simple.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Difficult to Return to After Seeing a Vast Ocean \u0026ndash; Li Zi \u0026amp; James\nOnly after experiencing something can you know what is best. In investing, only after actually operating and experiencing market fluctuations and the impact of different investment strategies can you more firmly choose the long-term investment strategy that suits you.\nThe More Money You Borrow, the More Money You Have \u0026ndash; James\nUnderstand and control risk, not avoid it. Understanding how to use leverage can accelerate wealth growth, but only with proper risk management, such as building a solid asset allocation.\nCash is Air \u0026ndash; James\nCash is very important and you must keep enough cash to deal with market fluctuations and emergencies.\nV. Summary # This live stream focused on the theme of \u0026ldquo;Wealth is a gift.\u0026rdquo; James explained the importance of investing and financial management, the advantages of index investing, the relationship between risk tolerance and investment returns, and how to conduct reasonable asset allocation in a simple and profound way. During the Q\u0026amp;A session, students actively questioned their own issues and confusions. James patiently and meticulously answered them by combining practical cases and his own experience, helping the students better understand and master the knowledge and methods of investing and financial management. He also guided the students to overcome psychological barriers in investments, establish a firm long-term investment philosophy, and ultimately achieve financial freedom.\nDisclaimer: This article is a personal learning summary and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Topic # This session focused on the nature of capitalism and a brainless investment strategy. James criticized the current financial education system for \u0026ldquo;enslaving\u0026rdquo; the masses, arguing that it\u0026rsquo;s designed to create workers, not capitalists. He stressed the importance of asset allocation and understanding the true meaning of wealth to achieve financial freedom in a capitalist society.\nII. Briefing Content # The Essence of Capitalism: James likened capitalism to a massive AI, with complex and opaque operating mechanisms that can easily lead to confusion. He argued that capitalism is not inherently evil but a tool, the key being the user\u0026rsquo;s mindset and approach. Similar to the emergence of AI, capitalism also evolved from simple buy-and-sell relationships, its complexity making it difficult to predict and understand. Brainless Investing Strategy: \u0026ldquo;Buy when you have money, and never sell.\u0026rdquo; He emphasized index fund investing, particularly the Nasdaq-100 index fund (QQQ), as the core investment vehicle. He opposed over-diversification, believing that focusing on the US market is more effective due to its fairness, justice, and openness. The Importance of Asset Allocation: Asset allocation is the core of investing, and it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to develop a suitable strategy based on individual circumstances. James provided relevant links and video resources to help the audience learn more. A safe and sound asset allocation should be able to cope with market fluctuations, ensuring that even if the market drops to zero, one can still maintain their lifestyle for many years. He highlighted the concept of \u0026ldquo;being able to live comfortably for over a decade regardless of market fluctuations.\u0026rdquo; The True Meaning of Financial Freedom: True financial freedom is not just about possessing wealth but also about \u0026ldquo;knowing how to spend.\u0026rdquo; This means understanding one\u0026rsquo;s asset situation and knowing how much can be freely spent annually and monthly. He emphasized the concept of \u0026ldquo;knowing what to spend and spending it freely when desired.\u0026rdquo; Parenting and Responsibility: He encouraged young people to have children and cultivate their sense of responsibility and financial awareness from a young age, enabling them to be self-reliant. He shared his experience of educating his daughter, emphasizing the importance of letting children bear the consequences of their actions, starting with small things. The Meaning of Learning: The purpose of learning is not just for monetary gain but for ultimate enlightenment. One should absorb knowledge like a sponge, cultivate thinking abilities, and ultimately reach the state of \u0026ldquo;decreasing knowledge to gain wisdom.\u0026rdquo; He used the example of martial arts manuals to illustrate that learning is a process from having something to having nothing. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # YJ:\nSharing: Discussed the lack of financial education in Asia, using the moon analogy to illustrate the differences between Eastern and Western education. Mentioned the inspirational Jewish financial education book, Talmud. Question: How to educate children about finances from a young age. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Cultivate children\u0026rsquo;s sense of responsibility from an early age, let them understand the meaning of wealth, and encourage them to start financial planning and investment early. Avoid the negative views on money held by older generations. Ying Nuo:\nSharing: Shared the enlightenment gained after learning James\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy and how they implemented a simple asset allocation strategy, feeling secure and stable. Question: Question about the pledging ratio. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Corrected the concept of the pledging ratio, emphasizing that retirees should pledge or borrow 2% of their total assets for living expenses, and young people should choose QQQ for better growth potential. IM:\nSharing: Shared the simplicity and convenience of ETF investing, along with experiences sharing investment philosophies with friends and their views on having children. Question: Whether one should \u0026ldquo;know too much\u0026rdquo; in investing and life, and whether concerns about the future and AI would affect the willingness to have children. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Affirmed the importance of learning, but emphasized the need to learn to subtract, filtering out unimportant knowledge and information. \u0026ldquo;Gaining knowledge daily, losing wisdom daily.\u0026rdquo; Encouraged young people not to be afraid of having children, sharing his understanding of the meaning of life - \u0026ldquo;The meaning of life lies in creating the next generation of life in the universe.\u0026rdquo; Chang An:\nSharing: Shared news about a government department in China buying Nasdaq funds and becoming the largest shareholder. Question: The implications of this action and its connection to US-China relations. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Affirmed the investment behavior of the government department, believing it to be the correct way to manage finances, and encouraged other government departments to learn from it. He believed that governments should also engage in asset allocation. Sam:\nSharing: Shared entrepreneurial experiences and reflections on blind expansion, as well as personal confusion about retirement and future life. Question: Preparing for retirement but feeling lost about the future state of life and unsure how to prepare. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Retirement is not the only option, listen to your inner voice, and find a lifestyle that makes you happy. Don\u0026rsquo;t over-plan the future; things will work out. He also suggested that Sam think about streamlining company processes, improving efficiency, and making employees happier at work. Jason:\nSharing: Examples of young people staying at home after graduating from university. Question: How to help young people find meaning in life. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Cultivate children\u0026rsquo;s sense of responsibility from an early age and let them learn to be self-reliant. Parents should not over-pamper their children, let them take responsibility, and encourage them to enter society and serve others. He used his own daughter as an example to illustrate how to cultivate children\u0026rsquo;s sense of responsibility from a young age. IV. Key Takeaways # Spending money is moral. \u0026ndash; James\nSpending money should not be seen as negative; knowing how to spend and being willing to spend is the only way to truly enjoy the freedom that wealth brings. Also emphasized taking advantage of credit card benefits, points, etc.\nThe more we know, the greater the risks we don\u0026rsquo;t know. \u0026ndash; James\nAs our knowledge increases, we need to be more cautious in identifying and assessing potential unknown risks. The real risk is the unknown risk.\nThe class of those who know and those who don\u0026rsquo;t. \u0026ndash; James\nThere is a disparity in information and knowledge in capitalist society, leading to class differentiation between those who know and those who don\u0026rsquo;t. Wealth and capital are concentrated in the hands of a few.\nI may not know where I\u0026rsquo;m sailing, but I know there are some paths I can no longer take. \u0026ndash; Sam\nOn the road of life, clarifying what you don\u0026rsquo;t want is more important than knowing what you want.\nV. Conclusion # This session covered investment philosophy, life philosophy, parenting experiences, and more. James, with his unique perspective and sharp language, criticized the shortcomings of the current financial education system, proposed a \u0026ldquo;brainless investing\u0026rdquo; strategy, and emphasized the importance of asset allocation and \u0026ldquo;knowing how to spend.\u0026rdquo; He also discussed topics such as how to cultivate children\u0026rsquo;s sense of responsibility and finding one\u0026rsquo;s purpose in life, encouraging the audience to actively think about the meaning of life and contribute to society.\nDisclaimer: This article is only for personal learning notes and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Theme # This session centers around the importance of psychological resilience in investing. James\u0026rsquo;s core message is that mental strength is the key to investment success, while other skills and calculations are secondary. Investors need to maintain a highly optimistic mindset, viewing market fluctuations as opportunities rather than crises in the long run. Long-term investing, rational analysis, and maintaining a healthy mindset are more crucial than striving for precise calculations.\nII. Briefing Content # Correction on 401(k) and IRA: James corrects a statement from the previous session regarding 401(k) and IRA contribution limits, clarifying that the limits for each are independent, but that IRAs have income restrictions. He provides further explanations about the Backdoor Roth IRA conversion, advising listeners to manage pre-tax and after-tax funds carefully to avoid account confusion and complications during tax filing. Asset Allocation Strategy: He emphasizes the significance of asset allocation and suggests listeners refer to existing articles and Excel spreadsheets for simulations, discouraging impulsive decision-making. He offers various asset allocation plans catering to different risk tolerances and retirement stages, stressing the concept of \u0026ldquo;fuzzy accuracy\u0026rdquo; ‚Äì that it is not necessary to pursue overly precise ratios, but ensuring sufficient cash reserves is crucial. Example: A listener proposes an allocation of 60% QQQ and 40% cash, which James believes carries a risk of bankruptcy and advises them to consult the provided asset allocation plans. Leveraged ETFs and Rebalancing: Using QQQ\u0026rsquo;s beta value of 1.0 as a benchmark, he simplifies beta calculations for leveraged ETFs, for instance, QLD is considered 2.0. He recommends a gradual approach when adjusting beta during rebalancing, advising against drastic changes. For investors with earned income, the frequency and ratio of rebalancing can be more flexible. Example: He suggests that young investors can rotate investments among QQQ, QLD, and TQQQ every six months, then rebalance at the end of the year. Long-Term Investing and Market Volatility: James reiterates the importance of long-term investing, using the dot-com bubble of 2000 as an example to demonstrate that long-term investors ultimately profit, even after enduring prolonged market downturns. Market dips are opportunities, and investors should remain optimistic, buying whenever they have funds available. He refutes the notion that \u0026ldquo;investments in 2000 took 15 years to break even,\u0026rdquo; emphasizing that the market always recovers in the long run. Example: An investment of $5 million at the peak of the market in 2000, despite experiencing the burst of the internet bubble, would still have grown to $32.375 million by 2024. Brokerage Selection: He advises choosing brokerages with physical branch offices and understanding how stocks and cash are held in custody to ensure asset security. Example: He explains the risks of nominee accounts and recommends selecting brokerages that allow for direct ownership of stocks, encouraging listeners to inquire about the brokerage\u0026rsquo;s custodian banks for stocks and cash. Purpose of Holding Cash: He underlines that cash holdings are meant for emergencies and to seize buying opportunities during market downturns, not for pursuing interest income. Example: He suggests maintaining a 20% cash position, a portion of which can be utilized for adding to leveraged ETFs during dips. Investment Target Selection: He recommends selecting suitable investment targets based on individual circumstances. For instance, retirees or individuals with limited funds may consider high-dividend ETFs, while younger individuals or those with ample funds should focus on growth-oriented ETFs like QQQ. Example: Addressing a listener holding SCH, James advises them to assess whether high-dividend ETFs are appropriate based on their asset level and annual expenses. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Danny:\nShares: He has been following James\u0026rsquo;s investment strategy for three years and achieved a return of approximately 35%. Chang\u0026rsquo;an:\nQuestion: Brokerage security and recommendations in Hong Kong. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Choose brokerages with physical branch offices in the region, understand the custodian banks for stocks and cash, and avoid easily dissolved online brokerages. Eric:\nShares: He began investing during the pandemic, experienced the hardships of short-term trading, and eventually recognized the importance of long-term investing and psychological control. He uses the example of Jesse Livermore to illustrate the risks of trading. Jessie:\nShares: Both she and her husband are nearing 60 years old, and a portion of their investment funds comes from a mortgage loan. She expresses concerns about a potential market crash and the risk of USD devaluation. Questions: How to cope with a possible future market crash, especially with a mortgage due before retirement? What about USD devaluation? Are there risks associated with concentrating large sums of money in a single brokerage account? Is it feasible to refinance the mortgage in five years or repay it early with funds from the investment account? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The market is unlikely to experience losses within a 15-year timeframe. Ensure you can comfortably handle mortgage payments for the next 13 years; the most secure approach is to sell the house and repay the loan. He declines to answer hypothetical questions. Stocks are registered under the investor\u0026rsquo;s name, hence the risk of brokerage failure is manageable. Refinancing or early repayment is not recommended. Excessive focus on short-term interest gains is akin to \u0026ldquo;penny wise, pound foolish,\u0026rdquo; and ultimately increases risk. Sam:\nShares: He went all-in on QQQ, but after some short-term trading, realized it wasn\u0026rsquo;t suitable for him and experienced psychological pressure due to large position fluctuations. Question: How to overcome the psychological pressure brought about by fluctuations in a large portfolio? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Focus on realized gains rather than unrealized gains. Maintain 20% cash and 20% leveraged ETFs to stabilize your mindset. Exercise caution with short-term trading, as it may not be sustainable in the long run. Haoqing:\nShares: He uses examples of friends gambling and raising children to illustrate the importance of moderate expectations and nurturing interests. He compares and contrasts education philosophies and Nobel Prize achievements between China and the US, emphasizing the significance of financial freedom for the next generation. IV. Highlights # Mental fortitude is the equipment for investing, it determines whether you will succeed. \u0026ndash; James\nInvestment skills and calculations are undoubtedly important, but psychological resilience is the ultimate factor that decides investment success. Even for simple index fund investing, a sound mental state is needed to navigate market volatility.\nA market downturn is not a disaster, it\u0026rsquo;s an opportunity. \u0026ndash; James\nFrom a long-term investment perspective, market downturns provide excellent opportunities to acquire high-quality assets. Maintain a long-term outlook and don\u0026rsquo;t be intimidated by short-term fluctuations.\nThere should be a limit to human pessimism. \u0026ndash; James\nExcessive pessimism and worry are detrimental to investments. One should rationally analyze risks and develop sensible coping strategies. Do not let extreme scenarios or low-probability events unduly influence investment decisions.\nParents sometimes have these expectations for their children, don\u0026rsquo;t impose your unfulfilled aspirations on them. \u0026ndash; Haoqing\nParents should respect their children\u0026rsquo;s individuality and interests and refrain from forcing their own unaccomplished goals onto them. Allowing children to have a joyful childhood and the autonomy to choose their own paths in life is more important than chasing conventional success.\nV. Summary # In this session, James reiterates the importance of mental fortitude in investing and the effectiveness of long-term investment and asset allocation strategies. By addressing listeners\u0026rsquo; practical concerns, such as retirement planning, market volatility, and capital security, he helps them better understand and apply these investment principles. James also provides advice on choosing appropriate investment targets and the purpose of holding cash, aiding listeners in constructing more comprehensive investment strategies. Haoqing\u0026rsquo;s sharing sparked reflection on educational philosophies and life values, advocating for a focus on children\u0026rsquo;s overall development and mental well-being.\nDisclaimer: This document is only for personal learning and note-taking purposes and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Topic # This session centered around investment cycles, exploring how to assess market cycles, highlighting the difficulty in distinguishing between acting too early and making wrong judgments during cycle shifts. It used Buffett\u0026rsquo;s actions during the 2008 financial crisis as a case study. Additionally, it discussed risks related to real estate investment, insurance, and stock pledges, while providing an in-depth analysis of asset allocation strategies, particularly comparing and recommending approaches for the Taiwanese and US markets.\nII. Briefing Content # Investment Cycles\nInvestor sentiment is likened to a pendulum, swinging between extreme fear and extreme optimism. Differentiating between premature judgments and incorrect ones during cycle changes is challenging, as exemplified by Buffett\u0026rsquo;s public announcement of buying stocks in late 2008, followed by a further 30% market decline. Swing trading is no longer recommended, as the market perpetually rises, making long-term investment the key. Risks of Real Estate Investment\nReal estate investment is considered high-risk, requiring maintenance and incurring high holding costs like property taxes and HOA fees. US property tax is a holding tax; the longer you hold, the more tax you pay. Rental yields are low, around 2% in the US Bay Area after deducting expenses. The biggest risks of buying a house are job loss and having outstanding mortgage debt at retirement. Insurance Choices\nAvoid commercial insurance, such as life insurance, long-term care insurance, universal life insurance, etc. Necessary insurance includes health insurance and term life insurance. Term life insurance is suitable for those who are the sole income source for their family, providing support for children under 18. Risks of Stock Pledging\nStock pledging is extremely risky, especially in the Taiwanese market, with a maintenance ratio requirement of 167%. Absolutely forbid using borrowed funds from stock pledges for reinvestment. In Taiwan, leveraged ETFs can be pledged, but risks still exist. Be cautious about diversifying risks in stock pledging in Taiwan. Do not pledge all assets to the same financial institution, and avoid pledging everything at once. Taiwanese investors are advised to adopt the \u0026ldquo;Situation 3\u0026rdquo; asset allocation strategy: 30% cash, 30% leverage, and 40% QQQ or other broad-based index funds. Asset Allocation Strategies\nWhen selecting investment targets, understand their risk and return characteristics, and allocate assets reasonably based on your circumstances. Long-term investment in QQQ index funds is like piloting an aircraft carrier‚Äîstable and offering considerable returns. Investing in individual stocks and sectors is like sailing a small boat‚Äîhigh risk and susceptible to market fluctuations. Investments in individual stocks and sectors are similar to the once-booming railway industry, which was eventually replaced by new technologies and industries. For example, the semiconductor industry may also be eliminated in the future. QQQ index funds have a replacement mechanism to promptly remove underperforming stocks, maintaining overall growth momentum. Investing in individual stocks requires the ability to identify potential opportunities and understand market and industry trends, as exemplified by James\u0026rsquo; interaction with NVIDIA\u0026rsquo;s CEO before its IPO and his purchase of Amazon shares during its slump. For retirement accounts, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to invest all Rust account funds in leveraged ETFs, while 401K accounts can hold cash or bonds. Be cautious when borrowing for investment; ensure cash flow can cover interest payments and manage risks effectively. In the US, if capital gains tax is implemented, consider transferring funds to other countries. Avoid investing in the Chinese market due to policy risks and economic downturn pressures. Do not purchase annuity products; they offer low returns and carry risks. After selling a house, do not deposit funds into IRA or traditional IRA accounts. Be decisive in investing and avoid hesitation. For example, loss-making properties should be sold as soon as possible, and the funds should be invested in the stock market. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Eric:\nSharing: Used the analogy of QQQ index funds being like aircraft carriers and individual stocks being like small boats to illustrate the advantages of index fund investing. Sharing: James\u0026rsquo; channel not only shares investment knowledge but also many life stories, such as estate planning and tax planning, from which valuable lessons can be learned. Brian:\nQuestion: For employed individuals using the \u0026ldquo;Situation 2\u0026rdquo; asset allocation strategy, is it possible to set a higher Beta value, such as 1.1 or 1.2? Answer: There is no upper limit for Beta, as long as cash is at least twice the amount of borrowed funds. Excel spreadsheets can be used to simulate investment outcomes under different scenarios, allowing adjustments based on individual risk tolerance. Mike:\nSharing: The US is like a Bogue bird, adept at concealing its strength and waiting for the opportune moment to reap the rewards, which aligns with the long-term investment philosophy. Question: Will the central bank ignore economic recession and focus solely on inflation? Answer: The central bank will not ignore economic recession because it leads to increased unemployment, which is one of the central bank\u0026rsquo;s key concerns. Economic recession and unemployment are closely related. Cheng Ge (PC):\nSharing: Illustrated the drawbacks of investment-linked insurance policies through a real-life case study, recommending early surrender and transferring funds to QQQ index funds to recoup losses within a shorter timeframe and achieve higher returns. Lang:\nQuestion: Is it feasible to utilize market downturns to buy QLD leveraged ETFs using a Roth IRA account and convert a 401K account to cash, aiming to increase the proportion of funds in the Roth IRA account? Answer: If Rust account funds are limited, they should all be invested in leveraged ETFs. The 401K account can hold cash as a hedge. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to wait for market downturns to make the switch; asset allocation should be completed as early as possible. Tina:\nQuestion: If the 401K account is already maxed out, is it still possible to invest in an IRA account? Answer: After maxing out the 401K account, you cannot contribute to a traditional IRA account, but you can contribute to a Roth IRA account. Specific eligibility depends on income level and IRA contribution limits. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to check the IRA contribution limit for relevant information. IAM:\nQuestion: Will events like the Malaysian currency devaluation and the Hong Kong emigration wave impact the US economy and the US dollar? How does the US prevent currency devaluation? Will the companies in the QQQ index fund be affected? Answer: A country\u0026rsquo;s currency value depends on its creditworthiness, which is backed by national industries and power. The US possesses strong national strength and diversified industries, allowing the US dollar to maintain its strong position. The US government will safeguard the interests of American companies and citizens. It\u0026rsquo;s uncertain whether US companies will be directly affected by US dollar devaluation, but they will undoubtedly be protected by the US government. TT:\nQuestion: Are you still considering cycle investing at present? Answer: Yes, cycle investing will be considered, but not through the all-in, all-out approach used in the past. Instead, Beta adjustments will be employed to navigate market volatility, as it\u0026rsquo;s difficult for a large number of investors to keep up with rapid trading, thus requiring a more robust strategy. Question: Which US political party, Democrat or Republican, is more favorable to investors? Answer: In the long run, policies of both parties have minimal impact on investors. The market adjusts according to policies; for example, higher tax rates may induce investors to hold assets for longer periods. YJ:\nQuestion: Are there any differences in asset allocation strategies between Taiwan and the US? What is the role of the 00864B bond? Why is investing in 00757 no longer recommended? Answer: Asset allocation strategies are universally applicable. The main differences between Taiwan and the US lie in stock pledging rules and leveraged ETF choices. 00864B can be used as a cash alternative, similar to a USD fixed deposit. Reasons for no longer recommending investment in 00757 can be found in the videos from 2021 and 2022. Jason:\nQuestion: Can dollar-cost averaging (DCA) be used to invest in leveraged ETFs like Q2D? Answer: When investing in any asset, including leveraged ETFs, lump-sum purchasing should be adopted instead of DCA. Returns from DCA are likely to be lower than lump-sum purchasing. IV. Key Takeaways # QQQ index funds are like aircraft carriers, offering stability and substantial returns, while individual stock and sector investments are like sailing small boats, carrying high risk and vulnerability to market fluctuations. \u0026ndash; James \u0026amp; Eric\nChoosing long-term investment in QQQ index funds can mitigate the risks associated with individual stocks and sector investments, providing more stable returns.\nThe central bank will not disregard economic recession, as it leads to rising unemployment, a key indicator that the central bank monitors. \u0026ndash; James\nOne of the objectives of the central bank\u0026rsquo;s monetary policy is to maintain low unemployment; therefore, it will not stand idly by in the face of economic recession.\nLoss aversion is a common mistake among investors. Losses should be cut promptly, and funds should be reallocated to higher-quality assets. \u0026ndash; Cheng Ge (PC)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s crucial to overcome the psychological barrier of loss aversion in investing, decisively cutting losses to prevent them from escalating.\nThe US\u0026rsquo;s national strength rests on four pillars: government, the financial industry, businesses, and national defense. These four pillars work in synergy to achieve strategic goals. \u0026ndash; James\nAmerica\u0026rsquo;s robust, comprehensive national strength is the cornerstone of the US dollar\u0026rsquo;s strong position.\nIn the long term, policies of both US parties have a limited impact on investors; the market adjusts itself based on policies. \u0026ndash; James\nThe market has a self-regulating mechanism, enabling it to adapt to various policy environments.\nWhen investing in any asset, including leveraged ETFs, lump-sum purchasing should be adopted instead of dollar-cost averaging (DCA). Returns from DCA are likely to be lower than lump-sum purchasing. \u0026ndash; James\n\u0026ldquo;Buy whenever you have money\u0026rdquo; is the investment strategy James consistently emphasizes. DCA is less efficient for long-term investment.\nV. Summary # This session primarily revolved around investment cycles, with James explaining how to identify market cycles and emphasizing the distinction between premature and incorrect judgments, using Buffett\u0026rsquo;s actions during the 2008 financial crisis as an example. Furthermore, it provided detailed insights into the risks of real estate investment, insurance selection, stock pledging, and asset allocation strategies. In the Q\u0026amp;A segment, students raised questions and shared their perspectives on topics such as the aircraft carrier investment strategy, property tax, central bank policy, currency devaluation, and investment strategy in the Taiwanese market. James offered comprehensive answers to each question and reiterated the importance of long-term investment in QQQ index funds, along with the \u0026ldquo;buy whenever you have money\u0026rdquo; investment strategy.\nDisclaimer: This document is for personal learning and note-taking purposes only and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Topic # This session focuses on long-term index fund investing. The core message is: hold index funds firmly, ignore market fluctuations, maintain a proper asset allocation, and leverage the compounding effect of time to achieve financial freedom. James also warns against investment scams and emphasizes avoiding unnecessary risks, while offering advice on investing in children\u0026rsquo;s education funds.\nII. Presentation Summary # Advantages of Index Funds: Long-term index fund investing eliminates the need to follow short-term market fluctuations, international affairs, financial reports, and economic data. Focus on asset allocation and consistent investment. The Power of Compounding: James uses several examples to illustrate the magic of compounding: A monthly investment of 1000 TWD can grow to 17.3 million TWD in 40 years; a lump-sum investment of 100,000 TWD can reach 18.8 million TWD in 40 years; starting early is crucial, as a 10-year delay significantly impacts final returns; one share of QQQ at 500 USD will become 25,000 USD in 30 years and 94,000 USD in 40 years. Safe Asset Allocation: Asset allocation is more critical than any market commentary. James recommends deleveraging and reducing debt for those nearing retirement, holding a larger cash position. For younger individuals with stable income, leveraging can be considered. He suggests using a beta of 1.0 as a benchmark, reducing beta when the market is overheated, and increasing it back to 1.0 during market downturns. For cash allocation, he references Buffett and suggests a sample allocation (Scenario 3): 40% index funds, 30% 2x leveraged funds, and 30% cash. Beware of Investment Scams: Don\u0026rsquo;t trust investment information from unknown accounts or websites. Choose legitimate financial institutions. Don\u0026rsquo;t Give Money Directly to Children: James uses personal anecdotes and case studies to caution against putting assets directly in children\u0026rsquo;s names, as this may discourage their initiative or cause family conflicts. However, investing children\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;lucky money\u0026rdquo; (red envelopes) for them is recommended as an educational fund. Risks of Real Estate Investment: James reiterates his advice against early homeownership for young people, arguing that real estate is illiquid, high-risk, and ties up capital that could be used for other investments. He highlights the added risk in Taiwan, where mortgage debt remains even after foreclosure. Recommended Learning Resources: He recommends a YouTube channel called \u0026ldquo;‰ªÄ‰πàÂÄºÂæóËØª\u0026rdquo; (What\u0026rsquo;s Worth Reading) for valuable content on value investing. Emergency Fund: Maintain a cash reserve equivalent to six months of living expenses in a money market fund account. Investing this emergency fund in stocks is not recommended. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Jeff:\nShares: Highlights misconceptions about investing held by two listeners and emphasizes the importance of carefully studying James\u0026rsquo;s lecture notes, particularly the chart on page two. James\u0026rsquo;s response: Affirms Jeff\u0026rsquo;s points and re-emphasizes the importance of a solid investment philosophy to avoid being swayed by market noise. Cat:\nShares: A listener holding 35 million TWD in 00662 still finds the 2% withdrawal rate insufficient. Discusses the spending needs and inheritance considerations of single individuals. James\u0026rsquo;s response: Different indices have different volatility and dividend yields, requiring adjustments to withdrawal rates. For higher withdrawals, consider ETFs with higher dividend yields, such as 0056, which yields around 4-5%. H:\nQuestion: High rental costs for young people, should they buy a house? Mortgages offer tax deductions, while renting does not. Concerned about insufficient funds for leveraged investing. James\u0026rsquo;s response: Recommends watching the \u0026ldquo;30 Years of Different Destinies\u0026rdquo; video, which analyzes the pros and cons of renting versus buying. Young people should prioritize investing in index funds to build wealth through compounding and consider buying a house later. Yonglin:\nQuestion: Should money be invested in children\u0026rsquo;s names for long-term holding? Should a mortgage-free house be sold to invest in index funds after retirement? James\u0026rsquo;s response: Advises against putting money directly in children\u0026rsquo;s names.

Main Topic # During periods of market volatility, investors should prioritize risk control and maintain a positive and optimistic mindset. By establishing a rational asset allocation strategy, such as holding cash, index funds, and leveraged funds, and selecting an appropriate allocation plan based on individual circumstances, investors can effectively mitigate market risks and ensure survival even in extreme situations.\nII. Briefing Content # Investment Objective: Identify high-quality investment targets, such as market-capitalization-weighted index funds, and hold them for the long term. Avoid chasing high-return investment targets, as excessive volatility may lead to an inability to hold, ultimately hindering returns.\nRisk Control:\nDo not overestimate your risk tolerance, as market downturns often exceed expectations. Selling leads to permanent losses; the only mistake in the market is selling. Investing is a process that goes against human nature, requiring the overcoming of fear and greed. Always ensure survival in extreme market conditions, meaning possessing sufficient cash flow to sustain living expenses. Holding cash is crucial for mitigating risks. Investment Mindset:\nInvestors should remain perpetually optimistic, believing that the market will eventually rise. Be patient, as wealth accumulation takes time. Do not be swayed by short-term market fluctuations; adhere to a long-term investment strategy. Do not attempt to predict the market, and ignore market noise. Keep investing simple: buy when you have money and hold for the long term; avoid excessive trading. Asset Allocation:\nThe highest guiding principle of asset allocation is: you can still survive under extreme market conditions. Retirees need to hold more cash and can utilize leveraged funds to enhance returns while reducing risks. Employed individuals can choose different asset allocation plans based on their circumstances, but ensure a certain proportion of cash holdings. Do not alter your asset allocation based on market ups and downs, as this constitutes short-term trading behavior. Asset allocation needs to be adjusted based on individual situations. For example, when significant events like retirement or purchasing a house occur, reassessment and adjustment of the asset allocation plan are necessary. Leverage initially carries higher risk, which gradually decreases as the market rises. It is recommended that retirement accounts comprise at least 30% of total assets to effectively avoid taxes during rebalancing. Market Efficiency:\nThe market is efficient; it\u0026rsquo;s nearly impossible to find opportunities for consistent excess returns. Do not readily believe investment strategies claiming to achieve excess returns, as they are often unsustainable. The Role of Wall Street:\nWall Street\u0026rsquo;s primary roles are to provide liquidity and investment products, establish the framework for investment transactions, and lower the barriers to entry, allowing ordinary investors to participate. Investors need to understand how Wall Street operates to avoid falling into its traps. Market makers are a crucial part of Wall Street. They profit by providing bid-ask spreads while also offering liquidity to the market. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IM:\nSharing: Black swan events remind us that people are forgetful, easily becoming optimistic during market upswings and panicking during downturns. Question: How to control optimism and avoid overconfidence leading to bankruptcy? James\u0026rsquo;s response: Remember the highest guiding principle of asset allocation, ensuring survival under extreme conditions. Cash is the lifeline for survival. Sunny:\nQuestion: How to persuade people around me not to purchase insurance and financial products? James\u0026rsquo;s response: By calculating the annualized return rate of insurance products and comparing it with the return rates of other investment products, you can demonstrate that insurance and financial products offer lower returns. You can compare the return rates of insurance products with the long-term returns of index funds and point out that the income source for insurance companies and insurance agents is the premiums paid by customers. Jason:\nSharing: Experienced Apple Vision Pro and found its spatial computing capabilities impressive, but currently, it has limited functionality and applications, along with a high price tag. Question: If investing is so simple, what is the role of Wall Street experts? James\u0026rsquo;s response: Wall Street\u0026rsquo;s role primarily lies in providing liquidity, investment products, and the trading infrastructure, lowering the barriers to entry, enabling ordinary investors to participate in the market. Market makers are an essential component of Wall Street, making profits by providing bid-ask spreads while also offering liquidity to the market. Brian:\nQuestion: How can employed individuals utilize the asset allocation plan in Scenario 9? James\u0026rsquo;s response: Scenario 9 is suitable for retired individuals with loans. If you are employed and have substantial loans, such as a mortgage, you need to adjust the plan based on your circumstances. For example, pay off a portion of the loan before proceeding with asset allocation. Moreover, leverage carries higher risk initially, which gradually decreases as the market rises. Question: How to allocate and rebalance assets between a 401K account and a Roth IRA account? James\u0026rsquo;s response: It\u0026rsquo;s recommended that retirement accounts comprise at least 30% of total assets for effective tax avoidance during rebalancing. Due to the limited investment options within a 401K account, direct purchase of QQQ may not be possible. You can use similar alternatives or transfer funds to a Roth IRA account for more flexibility. Yingying:\nQuestion: What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between QQQ and QQQM? James\u0026rsquo;s response: The market is efficient. There won\u0026rsquo;t be a significant difference in the long-term returns of QQQ and QQQM. Choose QQQ, which has lower fees. Grace:\nQuestion: Should I convert 0066 to 00670L during a market downturn? James\u0026rsquo;s response: Do not change your asset allocation based on market fluctuations, as this constitutes short-term trading behavior. Using Fatality:\nJames\u0026rsquo;s response: Charles Schwab is recommended because it is both a brokerage and a bank, offering higher security. Fidelity only has brokerage services and lacks a banking license, potentially facing risks during financial crises. IV.

Main Theme # This session focuses on the philosophy of long-term investing, emphasizing the importance of independent thinking and risk management. James reiterates his long-held investment philosophy: choose the right investment target (such as QQQ), buy in early and hold for the long term, ignoring short-term market fluctuations, and ultimately achieve steady wealth growth. In addition, he discusses how to maintain a positive mindset, deal with stress and anxiety that may arise during the investment process, and how to choose a reliable brokerage to ensure account security.\nII. Briefing Content # Wealth is accumulated slowly, and enjoying the process of wealth accumulation is the meaning of life. Getting rich overnight or quickly is not the best way. Slowly accumulating wealth and enjoying it allows you to experience the true meaning of life and learn and grow from it. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly pursue high returns while ignoring risks. Many people pursue quick riches and hope for super high returns, but often overlook the risks involved, which may ultimately lead to losses outweighing gains. Learn to assess risk and choose an investment strategy that matches your risk tolerance. Investing requires finding a definite eternity, ignoring market noise, and maintaining inner peace. Index fund investing is a definite and eternal strategy that does not require painstaking research and operation. Simply holding for the long term can yield considerable returns. Investment is a loser\u0026rsquo;s game, not seeking to win, but seeking not to lose. In investing, avoiding mistakes is more important than pursuing victory. Index fund investing can help investors reduce mistakes and ultimately achieve victory. Buying in a lump sum at any time and holding for the long term is superior to other investment methods. Investing early and holding for the long term maximizes returns and delivers the best investment returns. Learn to distinguish between what can be done, what is effective, what can be worried about, and what is not worth worrying about. Focus your energy on important and solvable issues, ignore those that are irrelevant or beyond your control to improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary anxiety. Don\u0026rsquo;t work too hard, let your money work for you. Put your money into the market and let it create wealth for you instead of devoting all your energy to work. Learn to utilize investment tools to achieve passive wealth growth. All pressure comes from expectations, and all worries come from not having a solution. Lower your expectations and actively seek solutions to relieve stress and anxiety. Learn to transfer pressure to those who can bear it and think about solutions for the worst-case scenario. Don\u0026rsquo;t bear the pressure alone, learn to seek help, and think in advance about solutions to the worst-case scenario to calmly deal with challenges. Maintain inner peace, focus on the important things, and ignore the insignificant things. Stick to simple things, don\u0026rsquo;t get involved in complex things, to maintain inner peace and focus on what really matters in life. Account security is the primary issue in investing. Choose a large, reputable brokerage to open an account and avoid using online brokers. Online brokers have security risks, such as account theft and asset freezing. Choosing a large, reputable brokerage can better protect your account security. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Dave:\nSharing: Shared the results of James\u0026rsquo; TQQQ simulation backtest and raised the question of how to avoid the risk of a sharp TQQQ drawdown. Question and James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: James believes that it is impossible to predict the market and avoid all risks completely. The important thing is to control risk exposure and avoid over-betting. If you are worried about the volatility of TQQQ, you can choose a more conservative investment strategy, such as QQQ. James also reminds everyone to distinguish between personal thinking and public advice, and not to be easily swayed by the thoughts of others. Minjianlian:\nSharing: Shared his experience of investing in stocks through his company\u0026rsquo;s savings association, as well as discussions about the MAGS fund and emergency funds. Question and James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: About the MAGS fund: James believes that it is uncertain whether the MAGS fund can outperform QQQ in the long term. Investment should choose targets that have been tested by time, such as QQQ or SPY. About emergency funds: James believes that emergency funds are a personal responsibility and government policies cannot be relied upon entirely. Everyone should prepare sufficient emergency funds according to their own circumstances to cope with contingencies. Learn:\nQuestion and James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Regarding the performance of 00670L, James explained the performance difference caused by USD hedging and how to solve it by investing in QLD through sub-brokerage. He emphasized that Beta and ROI are different concepts. Beta represents volatility, not ROI. The investment model in Taiwan needs to be adjusted according to specific circumstances, such as maintenance margin requirements and exchange rate fluctuations. JJU:\nSharing: Shared his insights on market unpredictability and the importance of mentors and friends. He believes that investing, in addition to selecting good targets, is more about maintaining inner peace and enhancing one\u0026rsquo;s spiritual level. Question and James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: About the difference between reinvest and buy share: James explained the difference between reinvesting and buying shares. The former automatically invests dividends or capital gains into the investment target, while the latter uses new funds to buy shares. About the fund ratio of Roth IRA and Individual Brokerage Account: It is recommended to maximize the Roth IRA limit if possible. About real estate mortgage investment: It is recommended to sell the property if possible to reduce the risk of investing in real estate. Otherwise, consider a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) for investment, but pay attention to risk control and ensure that you can repay the loan on time. HELOC is a revolving credit line, similar to a credit card, which can be withdrawn and repaid at any time. Draft down:\nSharing: Proposed the possibility of leveraging 0% interest credit cards for investment and using the box spread strategy to increase capital utilization. Question and James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: About credit card investment: James believes that credit card limits are limited and there is a risk of not being able to renew the loan, making it unsuitable as a main source of investment funds. It is only suitable for short-term turnover of small amounts of funds. About the box spread strategy: James believes that the box spread strategy is too complex and risky and is not recommended for ordinary investors. Jason:\nQuestion and James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: How to overcome short-term pain in the investment process: James suggested lowering expectations, not pursuing perfection or getting rich quickly, finding solutions to problems, and transferring the pressure to those who can bear it, such as superiors or more experienced individuals. Think about solutions for the worst-case scenario, such as job loss or investment losses, and maintain a positive mindset, believing that the problem will eventually be solved. About non-US tax resident investing in US stocks: James believes that non-US tax residents can use their passports to open brokerage accounts in the US without a Social Security Number. It is recommended to choose large, reputable brokers, such as Charles Schwab, and avoid using online brokers, such as Webull and Robinhood, as online brokers have security risks and imperfect regulations.
