      <description>In this lecture, James emphasizes that long-term investors need not pay excessive attention to short-term market volatility, international affairs, financial statements, or economic conditions. The core strategy is to buy and hold high-quality index funds (such as the Nasdaq 100) and maintain a long-term holding period (10-20 years or more), aiming for returns of several times the initial investment. The lecture focuses on the importance of risk management, including holding sufficient cash, understanding and accepting the possibility of significant market declines (such as 50% or more), and avoiding leverage or market timing. It also addresses questions from students regarding asset allocation (433, 442), annual rebalancing, investing new funds, the Canadian ETF (HXQ), managing mindset during market downturns, handling differing investment views among family members, and opinions on current market events (such as tariffs).</description>

<p>The core theme of this lecture is <strong>the mindset and strategies of long-term investors</strong>: adhering to a long-term hold of index funds in the face of market volatility and uncertainty, ignoring short-term fluctuations, and emphasizing the importance of risk management and maintaining sufficient cash.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Volatility Irrelevance:</strong> For investors preparing to hold assets for 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, or even longer (such as for retirement), short-term market price fluctuations (&ldquo;market price&rdquo;) are irrelevant because they are not selling at this moment. The focus should be on long-term (10-20 years later) multiple (4x, 5x, 10x) growth.</li>
<li><strong>Information Noise Filtering:</strong> Short-term information such as market analysis, financial statements, economic conditions, and international affairs are all noise for long-term investors who are not selling, and should be ignored. Don&rsquo;t listen, don&rsquo;t watch, don&rsquo;t pay attention, and short-term problems will not exist.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Staying Alive&rdquo; is Paramount:</strong> The primary principle of investing is being able to withstand extreme market declines (such as a 50% drop or even more) and &ldquo;stay alive.&rdquo; Those who cannot tolerate volatility are not suitable for investing and should stay away from the market.</li>
<li><strong>Risk is Ubiquitous:</strong> Risk can happen at any time (an earthquake next second, a company going bankrupt, etc.). Recognize, understand, and control risk. Be prepared to deal with the worst-case scenarios (such as the market going to zero, unemployment), ensuring basic living necessities are met.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Cash:</strong> Allocating sufficient cash (such as 20% or more) is key to risk control, ensuring the ability to maintain living standards during a market crash.</li>
<li><strong>Investor Optimism:</strong> Investing is like starting a business, requiring extreme optimism and belief that the market will eventually rise (&ldquo;always towards the sunlight&rdquo;).</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Greed and Fear:</strong> Do not try to &ldquo;buy the dip&rdquo; (&ldquo;touching the bottom might lead to touching a great white shark&rdquo;), &ldquo;the more greedy, the poorer.&rdquo; The market has no bottom, only lower. Maintain a peaceful mindset, not panicking due to declines.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on Index Funds:</strong> Primarily invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ and its local versions, such as Taiwan 00662, Canada HXQ). Investing in individual stocks is not recommended because the risk of individual stocks far exceeds that of indexes (greater volatility, risk of disappearing).</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Never Sell&rdquo; Only Applies to Indexes:</strong> The strategy of &ldquo;buy and hold, never sell&rdquo; applies to index funds because they have a self-elimination and update mechanism. Individual stocks cannot guarantee long-term existence (such as Kodak, BlackBerry), requiring timing the sale or switching stocks. Buffett&rsquo;s holding of Coca-Cola is also not absolutely eternal.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation and Rebalancing:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Allocation Ratio:</strong> Mentioned allocation methods such as 433 (40% original + 30% leverage + 30% cash) and 442 (40% original + 40% leverage + 20% cash).</li>
<li><strong>Investing New Funds:</strong> Invest according to the allocation ratio. For example, under the 433 allocation, a monthly salary can be invested with 6 months in the original, 3 months in leverage, and 3 months in cash. For 442, invest with 4 months in the original, 4 months in leverage, and 4 months in cash (or 5/5/2 or other approximately correct methods).</li>
<li><strong>Annual Rebalancing:</strong> Rebalance once a year at the end of the year. No need to be too precise with monthly investments. Frequent rebalancing (such as based on price points) is incorrect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Canadian ETF HXQ:</strong> Specifically mentioned Canada&rsquo;s HXQ, because it does not pay dividends, avoiding withholding tax, making it an alternative to QC.</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Independent Learning:</strong> Emphasized the importance of independent learning and thinking, recommending watching specific series of videos (e.g., newcomers watch 451, then start from 398 and watch in order to the latest).</li>
<li><strong>Community Selection:</strong> Be wary of noisy investment groups lacking effective answers, or even containing &ldquo;deviant&rdquo; viewpoints. It&rsquo;s better to ask James directly. Mentioned that a certain mainland group has become frivolous and started charging fees, discouraging participation.</li>
<li><strong>Understand the Spirit, Not the Letter:</strong> When taking advice (such as &ldquo;never sell&rdquo;), understand its core spirit (long-term holding philosophy), rather than nitpicking (such as questioning whether rebalancing counts as selling).</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Predict the Market:</strong> It&rsquo;s impossible to predict market highs and lows. Don&rsquo;t try to buy the dip or sell high and buy low. Most people can&rsquo;t do it. CC&rsquo;s example illustrates the consequences of failed selling high and buying low.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage Risk:</strong> <strong>Absolutely prohibit</strong> using funds from stock pledging or margin to reinvest and increase positions. Market declines can far exceed expectations (halving again after halving). Leverage will amplify risk, leading to liquidation (&ldquo;being carried out&rdquo;). Even top investors like Buffett and Howard Marks cannot predict the absolute bottom.
<ul>
<li><strong>Distinguish Safe Leverage:</strong> ÁêÜË¥¢Âûã mortgage (such as in Taiwan) used for investment is feasible if the interest can be afforded. Its risk nature is different from stock pledging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bottom Signals:</strong> True market bottoms are usually accompanied by extreme panic, with no one daring to buy and bulls in despair. When people still want to buy the dip and add leverage, it&rsquo;s usually not the real bottom.</li>
<li><strong>Different Perspectives:</strong> Understand that the views of different people (e.g., Musk vs. Buffett) stem from their different positions and experiences. No need to argue about right or wrong, the focus is on understanding their logic.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: The market is fluctuating, and friends are reacting strongly, but the teacher and myself remain calm. Shared a &ldquo;psychological stability card&rdquo; made by a friend, available on their social media.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Narrated the story of a friend who trusted her teacher in 2018, when the US-China trade war caused a sharp 20% market drop, and insisted on selling stocks because they couldn&rsquo;t handle the pressure. Emphasized the importance of mental state, and that &ldquo;leaving the market&rdquo; is a greater risk than market declines, like jumping off a speeding train.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: Leaving the market is indeed a greater risk than the market decline itself, and it is difficult to recover.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Which videos should beginners watch? (Didn&rsquo;t remember the series the teacher mentioned earlier)
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Look at the links in the handout. Beginners should first watch <strong>00451</strong>, then start from <strong>00398</strong> and watch in order to the latest (about 100).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: How exactly do you do rebalancing once a year?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Watch the videos to learn (e.g., 00451 and subsequent series).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: Are index funds passively managed and will automatically change their constituent stocks?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Yes, for example, QQQ will automatically adjust, maintaining the top 100 Nasdaq companies by market capitalization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 4: After experiencing market volatility, should I sell one-third after the stock price rises by 30% to lock in profits, and then buy back when there is a correction?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: The idea is good, but in practice, almost no one can do it. If you could do it, you wouldn&rsquo;t need to come to learn. Market timing is very difficult and not recommended. Suggested that she could try it and then come back to share the results. Historically, if this method worked, many people would be richer than Buffett.</li>

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: First watch the <strong>00451</strong> video. After watching, you can start investing a portion of your funds (beginners are advised to invest up to 50% at first). Then start from <strong>00398</strong> and watch in order to the latest (about 100). When investing, be sure to keep at least 20% cash.

</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: Shared personal experience: Came into contact with the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy in 2020, established a position at the high point in 2021 (cost about 340), and did not sell when it fell to 259. When it returned to breakeven in August 2023, she was worried about another decline and sold, wanting to buy back at a lower position. As a result, the market did not fall below and went all the way up, eventually chasing back at a higher position (cost 409). Realized the difficulty of market timing and the importance of holding faith. Now has a peaceful mindset in the face of declines.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: Ordinary investors have no valuation ability and cannot judge highs and lows, so they should not time the market. Accepting the long-term return of the index (annualized 10-12%) is a realistic and effective strategy.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: Learned about the teacher&rsquo;s method through his aunt and cut off individual stocks, switching to QQQ/00662.</li>
<li>Question 1: Previously, borrowed NT$2 million when QQQ was about 500 and invested it all at once (believing in not guessing highs and lows). Now the market is falling, and there is no extra cash. Can I continue to increase positions through stock pledge loans?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: <strong>Absolutely not!</strong> The market may fall even deeper (halving again after halving). Pledging and reinvesting carries the risk of being forcibly liquidated to zero (&ldquo;being carried out&rdquo;). Risk is unpredictable (such as a major earthquake destroying a technology park). Don&rsquo;t do anything that could lead to &ldquo;death&rdquo; (the end of your investment career), even if the probability is small. Being stuck won&rsquo;t kill you, but adding leverage might.</li>
<li>Kate&rsquo;s Comment: The market often reverses after washing out leveraged investors, and borrowing money to buy the dip is very dangerous.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Should I invest in batches now that I have money? The teacher said not to buy the dip, so should I invest now?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: &ldquo;Depends.&rdquo; It depends on the individual&rsquo;s existing investment size, cash ratio, and risk tolerance. Relative to an existing large investment portfolio, a small amount of new funds (such as salary surplus) can be invested all at once. If the new funds account for a relatively large proportion, or the investor&rsquo;s mindset is tense, then it should be invested in batches, or adopt right-side trading (wait for the market to confirm the rise before buying). The key is to let yourself &ldquo;eat well and sleep well.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: The current market situation is similar to the trade war period during Trump&rsquo;s first term. The teacher&rsquo;s previous teachings (cash is the best medicine against human nature, human nature oscillates between greed and fear, annual rebalancing, not buying the dip) provide the answers. Now is a good time to review and learn.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: Agreed. Investing does not need to pursue exorbitant profits. An annualized return of 10-12% is enough to get rich. The key is to survive. Quoting Munger(?): &ldquo;Newbies die on the mountaintop, experts die halfway up the mountain, and veterans die at the bottom of the valley (being scared away).&rdquo; We need a safe and sustainable method, not luck.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: Recommends new students to watch video <strong>00451</strong> (investment lecture worth 100 million), emphasizing the importance of watching videos to understand the background of the strategy. It is difficult to grasp the essence based solely on Q&amp;A.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Shared personal lessons: After the pandemic, I did not believe the teacher. During the big drop in 2022, I liquidated my stocks and switched to US dollar fixed deposits with 5% interest, and missed the sharp rebound in 2023. The return was far less than holding the index. Now fully follows the teacher&rsquo;s strategy, and my mindset is calm.</li>
<li>Sharing 3: Plans to use the ÁêÜË¥¢Âûã mortgage (home equity line of credit) on the house to increase investment when the market falls.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: A <strong>ÁêÜË¥¢Âûã mortgage</strong> (if the interest can be afforded) is different from <strong>stock pledging</strong>. The former has controllable risk, while the latter has extremely high risk. Yin&rsquo;s approach is wise (Smart).</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: Reviewed six years of learning history, once took detours (such as playing TQQQ), but stopped after Munger&rsquo;s warning about leverage. Realized the subtlety of the teacher&rsquo;s method and wealth growth (2% of living expenses has doubled). Admitted that he did not fully follow the annual rebalancing principle (once operated according to price points) and realized the mistake.</li>
<li>Question 1: The USADCOK website shows that the total value of the US stock market is still 50T after the market decline, and has not decreased. What is the reason?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: I don&rsquo;t know the specific calculation method of the website, and it may not fully reflect the change in market value in real time. Further research is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: How do you view Musk&rsquo;s criticism of Buffett-style investing (unearned income)?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Understand Musk&rsquo;s perspective (creating value through real industry). But Buffett also has his contributions (effectively allocating funds and supporting the development of enterprises). The two represent different perspectives, with no absolute right or wrong. The important thing is to understand why they say so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: Regarding the risk comparison between Taiwan 0050 (Taiwan Top 50) and 00662 (Fubon Nasdaq) (due to concerns about the risk of the top seven technology stocks).
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: (Mentioned in the subsequent chat records) QQQ (similar to 00662) is already sufficiently diversified, and the return is usually the highest. Global markets are highly correlated, and diversification into other markets is not very meaningful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Quoted Shaw&rsquo;s words about the tragedy of life (utter despair vs. contentment), reminding us to remain humble and learn.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: I invested the proceeds from selling my house at the end of last year into 00662 all at once, at a relatively high point, and now I regret not investing in batches. Currently, I have a 433 configuration, but not much cash. Can I adjust to 442 and transfer some money market funds into the leveraged fund (00670L) to buy the dip?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: <strong>It is not recommended</strong> to reduce the cash ratio (from 30% to 20%) when the market is falling and you feel uneasy. Maintain the existing configuration and wait until the end of the year to re-evaluate. Holding 30% cash safely is more stable than taking the risk of increasing positions. Suggest deleting the APP, out of sight, out of mind, and focus on the cash held.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: How do you view the potential impact of Trump&rsquo;s possible global tariffs on the future?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Believes it is a short-term disruption, with a smaller impact than the trade freeze during the pandemic. The market and businessmen are highly adaptable and will quickly find a balance, eventually &ldquo;passing water leaves no trace.&rdquo; No need to worry too much.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: Gleaned a philosophy of life from the teacher&rsquo;s investment philosophy (observing, listening, and understanding from multiple perspectives).</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Difficulty in trying to teach investing to friends around me: friends don&rsquo;t understand indexes and prefer low-priced stocks; have low expectations for returns (3-5%); have weak savings ability. Discovered that the key problem is the habit of saving rather than the investment return itself.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: It is difficult to teach others, because people only accept what they want to accept. Knowledge requires practice. Listening without practice is like the blind touching an elephant. Encourage taking action (such as going to the bank in person to handle pledging to understand the process) rather than asking endless questions.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: Explained and apologized for the potential noise, poor management, and fee-charging group issues in the mainland WeChat group he manages. Explained the challenges of WeChat group restrictions, complex member backgrounds, and network restrictions. The fee-charging group is for discussing sensitive strategies under domestic policies in a smaller range (such as using financing to achieve a pledge effect), which is voluntary and refundable. Emphasized that he answers questions from group members privately seriously.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Shared personal lessons: When using stock financing to achieve a pledge effect, it is easy to &ldquo;get carried away&rdquo; beyond the predetermined proportion (such as 10%), and failed to promptly convert the obtained funds into cash, but continued to invest, amplifying the risk. Warned about the human challenge of leverage operations.</li>
<li>Sharing 3: Reminded domestic investors that although transferring funds to Hong Kong to purchase US dollar money market funds has higher returns, the difficulty of returning funds under foreign exchange control must be considered.

<ul>
<li>Question 1: If you have 1 million in cash (regardless of the source), how would James invest in the current &ldquo;bear market&rdquo; atmosphere?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Emphasized again &ldquo;Depends.&rdquo; It depends on the existing asset size, cash ratio, and risk tolerance. Small funds relative to a large portfolio can be invested all at once. Large funds or beginners/people with unstable mindsets should invest in batches, or wait for the market to recover (right-side trading). The key is to find a way that makes you comfortable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Another approach is to wait for the stock price to return to the buying point (such as 500) before buying. What kind of people is this suitable for?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Suitable for people who cannot tolerate book losses, and losses will seriously affect their mentality and even lead to selling at the bottom. This approach sacrifices some potential returns, but preserves the mindset and the possibility of continued investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: QQQ has risen from a high point of 408 at the end of 2021 to about 423 in April 2025. The return has not been high in the past four years (about 15/3.5 years?). How do you view this?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Three or four years is still short-term. Citing historical data (S&amp;P 500), investing for 5 years may still result in losses (annualized -2.58% is the historical worst). The focus is on the long term. There is a high probability of profit for <strong>15 years or more</strong>. Even in the worst 15-year period in history, the annualized return is about 4.21%. It is calculated that even if you buy at the highest point of 408 in 2021, after 15 years (2036), the stock price should reach about 742 even under the worst-case scenario. Looking back from 2036, today&rsquo;s 422 is an enviable low point.</li>

<li>Question 1: My nephew (24-year-old soldier) borrowed NT$2 million at a high point (QQQ around 500) and invested it all at once. Previously had a dollar-cost averaging foundation. Now faces enormous pressure from a strong mother (who only believes in real estate) who demands that he sell the stocks. The nephew himself is also under pressure, and even asked whether he could finance to increase positions. How to help the nephew cope with the pressure and persuade/appease the elders?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Unable to change the elders&rsquo; views, it is recommended to <strong>&ldquo;pay lip service&rdquo;</strong> to the mother (tell her that you have sold and stop sharing information) to protect the nephew from interference. Encourage the nephew to persist in long-term investment (hoping to be financially free after 15 years), emphasizing that he is very young and time is his greatest advantage. Any&rsquo;s support as an aunt is very important and can provide spiritual and necessary emergency financial support (although the nephew said he doesn&rsquo;t need it).</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Market fluctuations have nothing to do with us&hellip; short-term fluctuations should be ignored&hellip; just wait 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, we&rsquo;re talking about four times, five times, ten times.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Explains why long-term investors do not need to pay attention to short-term market fluctuations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The investment market will still decline in the short term. Lose more than 50% of your assets, so you must be able to survive. No matter how the market falls, you must survive. Survival is the key.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Emphasizes that risk awareness and survival ability are the top priorities of investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Buying and holding and never selling can only be done by people who invest in indexes&hellip; individual stock friends can&rsquo;t do it&hellip; who can guarantee that Moutai will still exist in 100 years&hellip; only index funds can&hellip; be sold at any time.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Distinguishes the differences in holding strategies between index funds and individual stocks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t keep buying and buying and buying while the market is falling, the more greedy you are, the more&hellip; the market has no bottom, only lower&hellip; In the end, investing should be about survival. Who can survive?

</blockquote>
<p>Background: Warns about the risk of blindly increasing positions and buying the dip in a falling market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything can happen with any risk&hellip; Absolutely do not do anything that will kill you, even if it&rsquo;s a one in a million thing&hellip; If you reinvest with financing or pledge and reinvest, you may die, so why would you go that way?

</blockquote>
<p>Background: Strongly opposes using leverage (financing, pledging) for investment, emphasizing its potential destructive risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leaving the market is a very risky behavior&hellip; When the train is running, if you leave the market, how can you chase the train&hellip; You want to jump around in it&hellip; impossible.

<p>Background: Summarizes forty years of investment experience, emphasizing the importance of safe and compliant methods, rather than relying on luck.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Newbies die on the mountaintop, experts die halfway up the mountain, and veterans die at the bottom of the valley.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Describes the common causes of failure for investors of different experience levels, emphasizing the ruthlessness of the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Funds are not effective, so we must effectively allocate funds like Buffett to promote the development of these small and medium-sized enterprises. This is his contribution&hellip; It&rsquo;s just that Elon (Musk) can&rsquo;t see it from his perspective, because they are on different mountain tops.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Explains the social value of Buffett&rsquo;s investment model (effective allocation of capital), responding to Musk&rsquo;s criticism and pointing out the existence of different perspectives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to look at it from a long-term perspective&hellip; After 15 years, it should be&hellip; a minimum of 742&hellip; People in 2036 will look back and be very envious that we can have a stock price of 422 to buy.
&ndash; James</p>

<p>Background: Using the worst historical 15-year return to predict the lowest point in the future, emphasizing the attractiveness of the current price from a long-term perspective.</p>

<p>This lecture, against the backdrop of market volatility, once again reaffirmed the core concept of long-term investment. James repeatedly emphasized that for investors with a cycle of more than ten years, ignoring short-term noise and adhering to holding high-quality index funds such as the Nasdaq 100 is key. Of particular importance is risk management, including maintaining sufficient cash, deeply understanding and accepting the possibility of significant market fluctuations, and <strong>absolutely prohibiting</strong> the use of leverage or stock pledges for reinvestment. The Q&amp;A session explored asset allocation, handling new funds, specific ETFs, mindset adjustments to cope with market downturns, handling different investment views among family members, and how to view poor short-term returns from a long-term perspective, among other practical issues, in depth. The core message is: maintain discipline, manage risk, believe in the long term, and you can &ldquo;stay alive&rdquo; on the road to investment and ultimately achieve your wealth goals.</p>

      <description>This session delves into how ordinary people can achieve financial freedom through correct investment concepts and methods. Key points include: everyone has an innate talent for wealth; vision determines the height of wealth; it&amp;#39;s hard for salaried workers to escape the &amp;#39;rat race&amp;#39; because they are trapped in a carefully designed cycle; poverty is not an individual&amp;#39;s fault but rather caused by social structures; money is a tool for achieving goals; ordinary people can absolutely achieve financial freedom through long-term investment in index funds; one must shed the &amp;#39;poor mindset&amp;#39; and recognize their own wealth potential and rights; it&amp;#39;s best to start investing as early as possible, because the power of compounding requires time; bonds and real estate are not ideal long-term investment vehicles; investing in the future of humanity is investing in technological progress; the U.S. market is worth investing in due to its innovation capabilities and market mechanisms; the Nasdaq 100 index fund is an ideal choice for sharing the dividends of technological development; the method for investing in index funds is simple but not easy to execute; avoid common pitfalls on the investment journey; employ the &amp;#39;buy when you have money&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;never sell&amp;#39; investment strategies; market downturns are opportunities; stock pledges can help investors address capital needs without selling shares; independent thinking is crucial in investing.</description>

<p>Many of us spend our entire lives struggling with money, working tirelessly for monthly bills, children&rsquo;s tuition, and meager retirement savings, like a hamster trapped in a cage, running hard but never escaping. Have you ever considered that you could have been richer? Have you ever thought that the sense of security you seek actually binds you, causing you to miss out on greater wealth?</p>
<p>Yes, everyone has an innate talent for wealth, a right we are born with, as natural as breathing, as natural as birds flying and fish swimming. Unfortunately, this right, this talent, has been forgotten, or even buried by our own hands through the &ldquo;education&rdquo; of reality and the &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; of society. From a young age, we are told: study hard, find a good job, work hard to earn money to support the family. No one tells us: you can be very rich, you have the right to be very rich, you don&rsquo;t even have to work so hard to have it all!</p>
<p>The value of this lecture is far more than teaching you one or two investment techniques; its true value lies in awakening you from that ‚Äúhamster dilemma,‚Äù making you realize your dormant wealth potential, and showing you a path to financial freedom. This path does not require you to have Einstein&rsquo;s brain, nor does it require you to have Buffett&rsquo;s luck, it only requires you to change your mindset, and then, to move forward steadfastly.</p>

<p>The extent of your vision dictates the height of your wealth. This isn&rsquo;t just some motivational slogan; it&rsquo;s a conclusion derived from rigorous logic and data analysis. Don&rsquo;t believe it? Let&rsquo;s crunch some numbers.</p>
<p>Many people find investing for something decades into the future to be too distant and unrealistic. But what if we look 60 years into the future? If you have 1 million now, through sensible investments and factoring in the power of compounding, you could have assets worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in a few decades. This is entirely possible; it‚Äôs actually a conservative estimate.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t ordinary people realize they can have so much wealth? The reason is simple: our concept of money is too narrow, we have insufficient understanding of our potential, and we lack a deep understanding of compounding, the &ldquo;eighth wonder of the world!&rdquo; Our understanding of money is still at the kindergarten level, while financial giants have a Ph.D.-level understanding of money, at least.</p>

<p>Why is it so hard for most salaried workers to escape the &ldquo;rat race&rdquo; dilemma? Because they are trapped in a carefully designed cycle: you work hard for a month, and before the paycheck even warms up, it has to go to capitalists, the government, and the bank. For that meager salary, you have to work like a rat running tirelessly in a cage, never escaping that vicious circle.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that society constantly brainwashes you with &ldquo;consumerism,&rdquo; telling you that buying big houses, luxury cars, and branded bags is the standard for successful people. So, you&rsquo;re burdened with heavy loans, barely able to breathe under the weight of monthly interest payments. You don&rsquo;t dare to quit your job easily, and you don&rsquo;t dare to challenge your boss. You become a complete slave to capital.</p>
<p>Do you think this is your own choice? Do you think it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re not working hard enough? No! This is a structure intentionally or unintentionally maintained by the entire society and education system. What do schools cultivate? Compliant cogs in a machine, not independent-thinking creators. Financial institutions design complex financial products, ostensibly to help you manage your money, but in reality? They earn high fees and interest, while you can&rsquo;t even outpace inflation.</p>
<p>This ‚Äúcontrolled environment‚Äù prevents you from realizing your potential for wealth, let alone changing your situation. You are like that hamster in the fable, the faster you run, the further you get from freedom.</p>

<p>But remember, money itself is not the goal, but a means to achieve our life goals. We make money not to become slaves to it, but to live better, to realize our own dreams and those of our families, to have the ability to help those in need, and to better serve society.</p>

<p>Can ordinary people really achieve financial freedom? The answer is: of course they can! Moreover, achieving financial freedom is much simpler than you imagine.</p>
<p>The key to financial freedom is not about having a high IQ, or mastering complex techniques, but rather whether you have the correct investment mindset and whether you can persevere in executing it.</p>
<p>The path to financial freedom for ordinary people is actually very simple: choose the right investment vehicle, hold it for the long term, and let the power of compounding increase your wealth like a snowball. Specifically, it&rsquo;s recommended to invest in the U.S. Nasdaq 100 index fund, a relatively low-risk investment choice with excellent long-term performance. In the long run, its annualized return is considerable.</p>
<p>Many people might say, investing in index funds, isn&rsquo;t that something even an idiot can do? Yes, it&rsquo;s that simple! But the problem is, how many people can truly hold on for the long term?</p>
<p>Financial freedom is not achieved overnight; it requires patience and perseverance. In the course of investing, you will encounter all sorts of challenges and temptations, but as long as you believe in your choice and continue steadfastly, you will surely reach the other shore.</p>

<p>The key to shedding the &ldquo;poor mindset&rdquo; lies in changing your mindset and recognizing your wealth potential and rights. You have to believe that poverty is not your destiny, and that you have the ability to change your fate.</p>
<p>Specifically, you need to learn the right investment knowledge, rather than being led by so-called financial experts or the media. You need to understand that true wealth comes from long-term investment, not short-term speculation or blind consumption. You need to learn to delay gratification, using the money you save for investment, rather than for buying things that are non-essential.</p>
<p>More importantly, you need to cultivate the ability to think independently, not to be swayed by others or blindly follow trends. You need to develop an investment plan suitable for your own circumstances, and then steadfastly execute it.</p>
<p>Finally, you must remember that financial freedom is not something that happens overnight; it requires patience and perseverance, believing in the power of compounding, and adhering to long-term investment.</p>

<p>Why invest? The answer is simple: to make money work for us, not us for money.</p>
<p>Through investing, we can make our money grow continuously in the capital markets, thus realizing an increase in wealth. This increase can help us withstand inflation, ensure our future quality of life, and ultimately achieve financial freedom, so we no longer have to toil for a living.</p>
<p>Investing is also a way to plan for and secure the future. Through investment, we can accumulate funds for retirement, prepare for our children&rsquo;s education, and create conditions for realizing our dreams. Imagine, when you retire, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about whether your pension is enough, you can travel the world freely, do things you love, what a wonderful life that would be!</p>
<p>In addition, investing is also a way to participate in economic development. By investing in excellent companies, we can share the dividends of their growth, and also create value for society, promoting social progress.</p>

</h3>
<p>Why is it better to start investing early? The answer lies in the word &ldquo;compounding.&rdquo; Compounding, which Einstein called the &ldquo;eighth wonder of the world,&rdquo; is more powerful than you think.</p>
<p>For example, if we calculate with a 12% annual rate of return (a figure that can be achieved over the long term), a 30-year-old who invests $283 per month can accumulate approximately $1 million by the age of 60. But if they started investing at the age of 20, they would only need to invest $85 per month to reach the same goal!</p>
<p>See that? That is the power of compounding! The earlier you start investing, the less principal you need, and the shorter the time it takes to achieve your wealth goals. Because the effect of compounding causes your wealth to grow like a snowball, the longer the time, the faster the growth rate, and the greater the power.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if you don&rsquo;t have much capital right now, as long as you start investing early and stick with it over the long term, you can accumulate a considerable amount of wealth. Time is the best friend of investment.</p>

<p>Many people think bonds are a stable investment, and some even say they&rsquo;re safer than stocks. Is this really the case?</p>
<p>In the long term, bonds can actually be riskier than stocks. Don&rsquo;t believe it? Let&rsquo;s look at the data. How have different asset classes performed over the past 200 years, from the early 19th century to the early 21st century? The results show that the long-term returns of stocks are far higher than those of bonds, and bonds have sometimes even lost money over periods of 20 or even 30 years!</p>
<p>Why is this the case? Because the yield on bonds is usually low, making it difficult to withstand the erosion of inflation. Moreover, bond prices are affected by interest rate fluctuations and carry some risk. In contrast, although stocks fluctuate more in the short term, they have higher growth potential in the long term.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about real estate. Many people believe that buying a house is the most value-preserving investment, and some even consider their house their most important asset. However, have you ever considered whether real estate is really a good investment?</p>
<p>From an investment perspective, the main problems with real estate are its poor liquidity, high maintenance costs, and unremarkable long-term returns. Imagine if someone spent 10 million Taiwan dollars to build a villa 35 years ago, could that villa be worth 30 million Taiwan dollars 35 years later? It‚Äôs unlikely. However, if they had invested that 10 million Taiwan dollars in the stock market, based on historical average returns, the current value would have increased by two orders of magnitude, possibly becoming 1 billion Taiwan dollars!</p>
<p>More importantly, real estate also involves complex factors such as location and market fluctuations, all of which can affect its investment returns, and ordinary people find it difficult to control them.</p>
<p>And what if you treat your home as a place to live? Then you&rsquo;ll be burdened with decades of loan payments, and monthly mortgage repayments will weigh you down. For this house, you have to work hard, not dare to quit easily, and not dare to pursue your dreams, you become a complete ‚Äúhouse slave.‚Äù Isn&rsquo;t that putting the cart before the horse?</p>
<p>Remember, a home to live in is essentially a consumption, not an investment.</p>

<p>The method of investing in index funds is really simple: choose a good index fund, such as the Nasdaq 100 index fund, and then buy in regularly, holding it for the long term. It&rsquo;s that simple. You don&rsquo;t need a background in finance, nor do you need to monitor the market every day. You can even leave it untouched for years.</p>
<p>But why is it that so few people are actually able to do this simple thing?</p>
<p>First, it requires you to have a long-term perspective and firm conviction. During market fluctuations, especially when the market is down, many people feel panic and anxiety, and even doubt their choice, eventually giving in and selling, and as a result? They often sell at the lowest point, missing out on the rebound that follows.</p>
<p>Second, it requires you to overcome your human weaknesses. In the course of investing, you&rsquo;ll encounter all sorts of temptations: today, this stock has hit its limit up, tomorrow, that concept is hot, the day after tomorrow, experts predict the market will plummet‚Ä¶ this noise will interfere with your judgment, leading you to deviate from your original investment plan.</p>
<p>Many people, even those who have learned this simple investment method, still cannot do it well. Some investors are impatient to sell as soon as the market rises slightly, missing out on the big gains that come later; some investors, although they have set a fixed investment plan, are always unable to stick to it, going at it haphazardly; and other investors, because they hold other types of stocks or investments, are unable to make up their minds to switch to index funds.</p>
<p>What does all of this show? It shows that the success of investing depends not only on the method, but also on your mindset, whether you can overcome your human weaknesses, and whether you can steadfastly execute your investment plan.</p>
<p>Investing in index funds requires &ldquo;patience&rdquo; and &ldquo;waiting,&rdquo; the determination to &ldquo;stay the course&rdquo;, which is what most people lack.</p>

<li><strong>The &ldquo;Financial Expert&rdquo; Scam:</strong> Many so-called &ldquo;financial experts&rdquo; are actually just salespeople for financial products. In order to earn commissions, they will recommend various complex financial products to you, such as insurance, bonds, annuities, etc. These products often come with high fees and less-than-ideal long-term returns. Annuity products in particular, are not only low-yielding and high-risk, but also severely impact your asset allocation and tax planning. Remember, truly good investments are often simple, and those complicated products are often traps.</li>
<li><strong>Noise from the Media and &ldquo;Experts&rdquo;:</strong> Many media outlets and so-called &ldquo;investment experts,&rdquo; in order to grab attention, publish all sorts of sensational market predictions. One minute they&rsquo;re saying a bull market is coming, the next a bear market is coming, and the next, that a certain industry is about to explode‚Ä¶ This noise severely interferes with your judgment, making you unable to focus on long-term investment. Remember, what really matters is the long-term trend, not the short-term fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>The Temptation of Short-Term Trading:</strong> Many people dream of getting rich overnight, so they like to buy and sell frequently, trying to capture every market fluctuation. However, short-term trading not only requires you to have superb skills and keen market intuition, but also to bear enormous risks. For ordinary investors, short-term trading is often not worth the effort, and can even lead to serious losses. Frequent trading is like a gambler in a casino, often eventually losing it all.</li>
<li><strong>The Risks of High Leverage:</strong> Some investors, in order to pursue higher returns, use excessive leverage, such as margin accounts. However, leverage is a double-edged sword, it can amplify your returns, but also amplify your losses. If used improperly, it can easily lead to total ruin, and even bankruptcy. Remember, the first priority of investment is to control risk, not to pursue high returns. Never put your fate in the hands of luck, especially not with leveraged fate.</li>
<li><strong>The Risk of Not Learning:</strong> Many people know nothing about investment. They don&rsquo;t understand the essence of investment, nor their own risk tolerance, nor the characteristics of the products they are investing in. Such blind investment is like crossing the road with your eyes closed, full of risks.</li>

<p>We all know that the long-term trend of the market is upwards, driven by economic development and technological progress, and it&rsquo;s an unstoppable historical trend. Although the market will fluctuate in the short term and even fall sharply, these are all temporary. In the long run, the market will always return to the upward trend and continue to reach new highs.</p>
<p>Many people always want to buy at the lowest point and sell at the highest point. But ask yourself, do you really have the ability to do this? Not to mention ordinary investors, how many professional fund managers can actually do it?</p>
<p>Trying to choose the best time to buy is often futile, even foolish, because no one can accurately predict market bottoms and tops. Instead of wasting a lot of time and energy researching market trends, it&rsquo;s better to adopt a &ldquo;buy when you have money&rdquo; strategy, and use that time and energy to work and live life, enjoying life to the fullest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never sell,&rdquo; these four words, don&rsquo;t they sound a bit extreme? But they are the secret to enduring market cycles, the essence of long-term investing.</p>
<p>The essence of investing is to share in the growth dividends of excellent companies, not to gamble, in a casino, diving in and out. The logic behind &ldquo;never sell&rdquo; is actually very simple: as long as you are investing in excellent companies, and as long as you believe that these companies can continue to grow, then you should hold them for the long term, sharing in the dividends that their growth brings.</p>
<p>Frequent buying and selling will not only increase your transaction costs, but will also cause you to miss out on the compounding effect of long-term holding. More importantly, it will expose you to human weaknesses.</p>
<p>When the market is falling, you will feel panicked and will want to sell; when the market rises, you will become greedy and will want to chase after the price increases. As a result? You are often buying high and selling low, and are constantly harvested by the market.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;never sell&rdquo; strategy can help you overcome fear and greed, and allow you to always stay in the market, sharing in the dividends of economic growth.</p>

<p>Market downturns, for many people, are a nightmare, a disaster. But for true investors, they are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>
<p>Why is that? Because when the market is down, the stock prices of many high-quality companies will be severely undervalued, like a discounted sale, and buying at this time is like picking up a bargain.</p>
<p>Warren Buffett once famously said, &ldquo;Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.&rdquo; This quote is about this very principle.</p>
<p>Market downturns are temporary, while the market&rsquo;s long-term trend is upward. As long as you can overcome your fear and stick to your long-term investment strategy, you will be able to seize opportunities during market downturns, buy undervalued high-quality assets, and lay a solid foundation for future wealth growth.</p>

</h3>
<p>The strategy of &ldquo;living off stock pledges&rdquo; can help you address your daily capital needs without selling your stock. This is a smarter way to manage finances.</p>
<p>Many people might ask, what is a stock pledge? Simply put, it is using your stock as collateral to borrow money from a financial institution. In this way, you can gain access to liquidity without selling your stock, and you can continue to enjoy the long-term appreciation of your stock.</p>
<p>Through stock pledges, you can avoid being forced to sell stocks with long-term growth potential due to temporary funding shortages. Furthermore, in many countries and regions, the capital gains tax rate is usually higher than the borrowing interest rate. Through stock pledges, you can also reasonably reduce your tax burden.</p>
<p>Of course, stock pledges also carry some risks. If the stock price drops sharply, you may need to provide additional collateral or face the risk of forced liquidation. Therefore, when using stock pledges, you must control your leverage ratio, and it is generally recommended that the pledge ratio not exceed 20% of your total assets.</p>

<p>In this age of information overload, we are bombarded daily with all sorts of information, especially in the field of investment. The opinions of various &ldquo;experts,&rdquo; various media reports, and various rumors, are difficult to distinguish between true and false, making people dizzy.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the ability to think independently, you can easily be swayed by this information and make wrong investment decisions.</p>
<p>Independent thinking is key to investment success. It means having your own judgment, not blindly following trends, not blindly believing in authority, and not being swayed by market sentiment.</p>
<p>The basis for independent thinking is learning and research. You need to continuously learn investment knowledge, study market laws, and understand the investment target. Only in this way can you form your own investment system and make correct decisions in the complex market environment.</p>
<p>Always remember that investment is your own business, and no one can make decisions for you.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Market Trends and Investment Philosophy:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Drives the Future:</strong> AI demand is not a bubble, but a genuine driving force behind technological advancement, promising a bull market spanning two decades.  We are currently in the early stages of this growth.  Morris Chang (TSMC Chairman)&rsquo;s perspective and TSMC&rsquo;s investments in AI corroborate this judgment. The long bull market has begun, seize the opportunity to join the wealth train.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility and Long-Term Investment:</strong> Market fluctuations are inherent to investing.  Downswings are followed by even greater upswings. Using historical data from the Taiwan Weighted Index, Nikkei Index, and the US stock market as examples, the session illustrates the long-term market development pattern: an initial period of rapid growth followed by a period of stagnation (e.g., 32 years in Taiwan, 35 years in Japan, 24 years in the US), before entering a phase of stable growth.  Therefore, overcoming panic caused by market volatility and adhering to a long-term investment strategy is crucial for ultimate success.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalism and Investment:</strong>  The side effects of capitalism are wealth disparity and the exploitation of labor. Learn to operate like a capitalist and profit from investment.  Hard work and saving money to buy government bonds will ultimately result in wealth erosion due to inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits of Quantitative Easing:</strong> Quantitative easing is beneficial for investors, fostering a low-interest-rate environment and driving asset price appreciation.  Those who fail to understand quantitative easing and complain about government money printing are often victims of capitalism, missing out on the benefits of asset appreciation.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics of a Mature Market:</strong> Mature markets are characterized by fair, just, and transparent regulatory mechanisms, companies focused on their core businesses, and a high proportion of long-term investors and institutional holdings. The Taiwanese market is gradually maturing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Investment Strategies and Recommendations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invest in Nasdaq 100:</strong>  The session recommends investing in Nasdaq 100 index funds (QQQ), with the option to allocate to S&amp;P 500 or high-dividend ETFs based on individual circumstances.  References to Nasdaq 100 index funds globally are provided for the convenience of investors worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Penny Stocks:</strong>  Refrain from investing in penny stocks, as they generally offer low long-term returns.  Real investment opportunities lie in companies that demonstrate sustained growth and lead technological advancements.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of Stock Pledging:</strong> Stock pledging offers advantages over real estate mortgages, as stocks, unlike real estate, do not depreciate and can be held long-term, potentially allowing for &ldquo;borrowing without repayment or interest&rdquo; (specific instructions are available in related videos).</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Flawed Rebalancing Strategies:</strong> Avoid a 50% principal + 50% leveraged ETF rebalancing strategy, as it carries high risk and can easily deplete cash reserves during market downturns.</li>
<li><strong>Estate Planning and Stock Pledging:</strong> When engaging in stock pledging, it is advisable to diversify assets across multiple brokerage firms, pledging a portion and keeping the rest as cash to facilitate estate handling for inheritors.  Cat supplemented this with a detailed explanation of the stock pledging inheritance process, emphasizing the importance of advance planning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Other Important Matters:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Warning and Disclaimer:</strong>  The content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.  Do not remit funds to unknown accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Program Format Adjustment:</strong>  The presentation content will be expanded to include material previously covered in short videos.</li>
<li><strong>QQQ Stock Selection Mechanism:</strong>  Addresses audience questions regarding the QQQ stock selection mechanism, explaining the advantages of the Nasdaq exchange and why technology companies prefer listing on Nasdaq.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging for Non-US Residents:</strong> Explains the regulations for non-US residents engaging in stock pledging with US brokers.</li>
<li><strong>Learning to Spend:</strong> Shares the philosophy of spending after achieving investment success, emphasizing the importance of focusing on future wealth growth and utilizing financial leverage for consumption.  Don&rsquo;t let wealth sit idle; learn how to use it.  This point is illustrated with the example of a listener who has $4 million but doesn&rsquo;t know how to spend it, calculating their potential wealth growth over 40 years and a reasonable spending level.</li>

</h2>
<p><strong>IAM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Expressed confusion about different types of economic crises and how the 2020-2023 pandemic period compares to previous bubbles after reading a book about economic crises.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  Which historical economic crisis is most similar to the economic downturn during the 2020-2023 pandemic?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The 2020-2023 pandemic was an economic shock caused by an external event, distinct from previous bubble economies. The 2000 dot-com bubble was an industry bubble with limited impact; the 2008 financial crisis resembled the 1929 Great Depression, both being asset bubble bursts, but the 2008 crisis recovered faster due to quantitative easing. The 2022 market decline was not a bubble burst, but a revaluation caused by central bank interest rate hikes.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> What did the US do to stimulate the economy that other countries couldn&rsquo;t replicate?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The US is less constrained by fiscal discipline and is willing to borrow and issue debt, allocating funds to social welfare programs for the elderly, children, and healthcare, while guiding domestic capital towards overseas investment to mitigate inflation.  Taiwan&rsquo;s government was advised to learn from the US&rsquo;s fiscal spending approach and guide capital towards investment, while also focusing on efficient capital utilization and building a social safety net.</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> Why are Chinese people so keen on buying houses?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> This is a vestige of the agrarian &ldquo;land is wealth&rdquo; mentality, which is no longer applicable today.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eason (Doctor):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Points to consider for Chinese investors buying Nasdaq ETFs:
<ul>
<li>Different brokerage firms have different fee policies and financing rates; careful comparison is necessary.</li>
<li>Domestic Nasdaq ETFs have premiums; buying during periods of low or negative premiums is recommended.  There are no limits for buying ETFs on the exchange, but there are limits for off-exchange subscriptions.</li>
<li>Recommends allocating a portion of assets to USD-denominated investments like QQQ, which can be purchased by opening brokerage accounts in Singapore or Hong Kong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Added:</strong>  Chinese residents have a $50,000 annual foreign exchange quota for overseas investments.  Hong Kong and mainland China identities have different withholding tax rates on US stock investments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dave:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Will the Nasdaq 100 index become stagnant like the Dow Jones index?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Currently, the Nasdaq 100 is the most competitive; excessive worry about the future is unnecessary.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> Is it feasible to only buy the top 10 companies in the Nasdaq 100 index?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The top ten companies change frequently; individual stock selection and portfolio adjustments are too cumbersome, and returns may not be higher.  Investing directly in index funds is more efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> How do VGT and XLK compare to QQQ?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> VGT and XLK track different indices than QQQ, with different constituent stocks and concentration. QQQ is more robust and has broader coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jiawen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Can an 80% leveraged ETF + 10% cash + 10% bond portfolio be directly pledged? How is this done?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, but a small-scale trial is recommended, for instance, borrowing $200,000 against $5 million in principal, or borrowing within $1 million against $10 million. Long-term borrowing strategies should be adjusted according to circumstances. It&rsquo;s possible to pledge only a portion of the stocks, leaving the remainder for additional purchases or other uses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Personal investment journey, transitioning from real estate to stocks, learning about stock pledging and asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Is there synergy between real estate and stock investment? How can real estate cash flow be used for stock investment?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  Buying a house is not recommended for young people. Real estate investment returns are lower than stocks and come with various risks (e.g., natural disasters, property taxes).  Even with positive cash flow, opportunity costs should be considered; investing that capital in stocks might yield higher returns.  Used Texas real estate as an example to illustrate the drawbacks of real estate investment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Qiu Xiao:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  What are the Canadian equivalents of US retirement accounts like IRA, Roth IRA, and 401k? Which account should cash be held in?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Roth IRA corresponds to Canada&rsquo;s TFSA, Traditional IRA to RRSP, and 401k to DCPP. The choice of retirement account for cash depends on the individual&rsquo;s balance between taxable and tax-free accounts and their asset allocation strategy.  One should choose to place cash in either a tax-free or taxable account based on their specific circumstances for tax optimization.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2 (Related to Eason&rsquo;s question):</strong> How can one invest in Nasdaq ETFs in China, and how can quota limitations be addressed?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Off-exchange subscriptions have quota limits, while on-exchange ETF purchases do not, but premiums should be considered.  Opening multiple brokerage accounts or opening an account in Hong Kong for US stock investment can be considered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Haoqing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Used the example of SpaceX launching rockets with a small team to highlight concerns about AI replacing human labor and the difficulties young people face in finding employment.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How can we address the challenge of youth unemployment in the AI era?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  Young people need to acquire AI skills to adapt to the future job market.  Recommends that schools incorporate AI courses into their core curriculum, cultivating AI talent from a young age. Philosophy is an important foundational subject but should not be a primary career focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jimmy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Discussed the changing times and the need for young people to adapt, sharing observations about the youthful demographics of Xiamen. Mentioned the importance of aligning investments with the times and shared some common misunderstandings about investing he had encountered.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What are your views on index fund investing? Is the long-term return of 0050 sufficient? What are your thoughts on individual stock investing (e.g., TSMC)?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Index fund investing is a method accessible to the general public, but many don&rsquo;t understand it and require time and experience to appreciate it. In the long run, QQQ and SPY offer higher returns and are more suitable for long-term investment. Individual stock picking demands specialized knowledge and skills and carries higher risks; it is difficult for average investors to select and hold high-quality stocks like TSMC for the long term.  The key to investing is finding investment targets that can be held long-term and sticking with them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Q&amp;A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TQQQ Pledging:</strong>  Learn about stock pledging and how to achieve interest-free borrowing through the recommended videos.</li>
<li><strong>Top 10 QQQ Holdings:</strong>  Frequent trading is discouraged; holding the index fund long-term is sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>BOX vs. SWVXX:</strong>  BOX is recommended for brokerage accounts to avoid dividend taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Conservative Investing:</strong>  Conservative investing can involve holding cash or holding index funds long-term.</li>
<li><strong>How to Spend Money:</strong>  Focus on future wealth growth and utilize financial leverage for consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Investing in US Stocks from within China:</strong>  Coming to the US to invest or remitting funds to the US for investment is recommended.  Consider opening an account in Hong Kong or using other compliant channels for investment.</li>

<p>The session centered on the core principle of long-term investment strategies. James reiterated his investment philosophy: &ldquo;Buy QQQ whenever you have money and hold it for the long term.&rdquo; The discussion expanded to cover aspects like investment philosophy, risk management, and values, incorporating current events and questions from attendees. James also shared insights from legendary investors like Warren Buffett, encouraging attendees to cultivate a sound investment mindset.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Buying at the Dip vs. Buying When You Have Money:</strong> James cited research from ChatGPT, indicating that even with the ability to accurately predict and buy at market dips, the long-term returns differed minimally compared to simply buying when one has available funds. Over a 20-year period, the difference was merely 8%, translating to a difference in annualized returns of less than 0.2%. Hence, rather than expending time and effort predicting market bottoms, it&rsquo;s more effective to seize opportunities and buy QQQ when you have the money.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Leveraged Funds:</strong>  Using the 2000 tech bubble as an example, James explained how leveraged funds can accelerate losses in bear markets, potentially leading to devastating financial setbacks, even bankruptcy. He simulated a scenario where an investor repeatedly buys more leveraged funds as the market declines, culminating in financial ruin. This served as a cautionary tale against the &ldquo;buy the dip&rdquo; strategy with leveraged funds, emphasizing the importance of risk management.</li>
<li><strong>Keys to Investment Success:</strong> James emphasized that the key to successful investment lies in overcoming human weaknesses. Maintaining a detached and &ldquo;unfeeling&rdquo; attitude towards invested capital and short-term market fluctuations is crucial for adhering to a long-term investment approach.</li>
<li><strong>Market Cycles:</strong> James stated he wouldn&rsquo;t teach attendees about predicting market cycles or any trading techniques. He considers these unimportant and prone to misinterpretation and misapplication, potentially leading to increased risks. He advocated for a long-term investment strategy, likening it to riding a cable car, a smooth and steady ascent to the summit of financial success.</li>
<li><strong>Money and Values:</strong> Acknowledging that individuals have different values regarding money, James advised understanding and respecting diverse values, discouraging attempts to impose one&rsquo;s own values upon others. He used the example shared by an attendee about a mother preferring a financial subsidy over a family trip to illustrate the diverse ways people assign value to things.</li>

</h2>
<p><strong>IIM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong> A story about a deceased friend, leading to reflections on money and values, and expressing confusion about balancing personal values with those of others.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  How to understand some people&rsquo;s &ldquo;frugality&rdquo; with money while being &ldquo;generous&rdquo; towards their pets.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> People manage their finances differently based on what they consider important and valuable. What might be significant to one person may hold little value for another.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> How to understand a mother who prioritizes money over a family trip? How to better understand the needs of others?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>  This mother might have certain unmet needs, possibly requiring material security before pursuing leisurely experiences. Understanding true needs involves offering more choices (e.g., money plus a trip). Avoid trying to change others&rsquo; values; focus on understanding and respecting them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong> Encountering a friend who suggested leveraging to purchase Nvidia stock, leading to questions about investment advice.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How to evaluate investment advice received from others?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>   The validity of investment advice depends on individual judgment and risk tolerance. It&rsquo;s important to avoid blindly following the advice of others and to think independently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Iny:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Experiencing a sense of calm and reduced anxiety after adopting James&rsquo;s investment approach.  This newfound peace of mind allows for dedicating more time to important matters like family, and interestingly, focusing on work has led to increased income.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to understand the phenomenon of increased income resulting from a dedicated focus on work?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> This exemplifies the principle that altruism ultimately benefits oneself. By focusing on serving clients and enhancing product or service quality, one ultimately gains client recognition and rewards, leading to higher income and a sense of accomplishment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Haoqing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared 1:</strong>  An experience with check fraud, prompting concerns about bank security and the risks of using checks.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>  Banks do not verify the identity of check depositors. Checks present security vulnerabilities, making it advisable to use safer online banking and digital payment methods like Apple Pay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Shared 2:</strong> Thoughts on the decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia, attributing this to factors like US regulations, labor laws, and unions.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> The decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia are multifaceted issues stemming from a complex interplay of factors, including national policies, labor laws, and unions. While Asian countries might resort to suppressing labor rights and environmental regulations to gain a competitive edge, the US places a higher value on worker well-being and environmental protection. This divergence in values contributes to different developmental paths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Becky:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong> Based on personal experience working in a digital payment company, Becky recommended that everyone stop using checks due to inherent security risks. Digital payment methods offer greater security and convenience, with features such as spending alerts that enable prompt response and recovery in case of issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong> As a long-time follower of James, Mike witnessed the evolution of his investment philosophy, from initially holding 30% SPY to converting to 100% QQQ, and eventually incorporating leveraged funds. He also shared personal investment experiences, like selling NIO and allocating a portion of his portfolio to private market investments.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Is investing in Intel after its acquisition worthwhile?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>  James advised against investing in large companies that are acquisitive. Acquisitions often lack efficiency, posing integration challenges and potentially hindering productivity. While acquiring smaller companies for technological advantages makes sense, acquiring large companies is akin to amassing a pile of scrap metal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong>  How to view the supply chain security concerns stemming from the US outsourcing 3C product manufacturing, citing examples like the BBB Call explosion and walkie-talkie incidents?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Espionage is ubiquitous, and supply chain security is just one facet of this broader issue. Governments might implant spy codes in chips and software for surveillance purposes. Explosions are a relatively rudimentary form of espionage; more sophisticated methods can be extremely difficult to detect and prevent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> Is it possible to offer advanced courses for more experienced attendees? He suggested using portfolio sharing as a means to differentiate attendees&rsquo; learning progress.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> James stated he wouldn&rsquo;t differentiate between attendees nor offer advanced courses. Assessing whether a student is genuinely learning is primarily based on their attitude, not investment returns or holding duration. Even portfolio sharing can&rsquo;t truly gauge learning progress. James mentioned his personal sensitivity to words and language, enabling him to discern learning attitudes from attendees&rsquo; emails and the way they pose questions.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The best time to buy is when you have money.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many obsess over finding the perfect entry point, but research indicates that even if you could perfectly time market dips, the long-term returns barely differ from simply buying when funds are available. Instead of wasting time trying to predict the market, seize the opportunity and act promptly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To succeed in investing, you must be indifferent to the money you invest and the fluctuations in stock prices.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overcoming the human tendency to fixate on money and fear short-term market swings is essential for maintaining a long-term investment strategy and achieving stable returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To achieve effortless investing, you need to be numb to money.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When investing becomes a habit, free from emotional impulses and external distractions, you can achieve optimal results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept of a &ldquo;benefactor&rdquo; is relative.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People perceive and absorb information differently. Who you consider a benefactor might not be perceived as such by others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to change other people&rsquo;s values.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone has their own values and ways of life. It&rsquo;s important to understand and respect diverse choices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Espionage is everywhere.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Information security is a growing concern. Be vigilant and protect your personal data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Acquisitions of large companies are generally inefficient, and leaders who are fond of acquisitions usually have inflated egos.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Integration complexities and high management costs associated with mergers often outweigh the benefits gained.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The US excels in areas such as finance and technology design, while Asian countries can only substitute and supplement in specific aspects.
&ndash; Haoqing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within the global division of labor, different countries have distinct strengths and weaknesses, leading to divergent paths of development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best judgments are validated by facts.
&ndash; Mike</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The success of an investment philosophy is ultimately determined by its long-term returns, not short-term fluctuations or gut feelings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your attitude determines my response.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James adjusts his responses based on the learning attitude of the attendees. Attendees who are truly dedicated to learning will receive greater guidance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investing in individual stocks will ultimately lead to bankruptcy; holding onto individual stocks will also ultimately lead to bankruptcy.<br>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies have lifecycles.  Holding onto a single stock long term significantly increases the risk of encountering bankruptcy. Diversification is key in investing.</p>
