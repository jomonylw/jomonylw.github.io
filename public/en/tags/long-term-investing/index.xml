<p>The core of this class is to establish a simple yet firm long-term investment philosophy. Teacher James emphasizes that investors should ignore market noise and short-term fluctuations, adhering to a strategy of &ldquo;buy, hold, and never sell.&rdquo; Successful investing requires not only the right asset allocation (especially using cash to build an &ldquo;anti-fragile&rdquo; portfolio) but also a strong psychological constitution, including steadfastness, patience, and faith, to ultimately achieve financial freedom and inner peace.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore Market Noise</strong>: Teacher James points out that in his 40 years of investing, almost all financial and political news and market analysis have been &ldquo;demons and monsters,&rdquo; useless for long-term investing. He quotes a student&rsquo;s message, emphasizing that social opinions and market volatility are irrelevant to long-term investors; enjoying the tranquility of the present is far more important than focusing on fleeting issues.</li>
<li><strong>The Best Strategy: Buy, Hold, Don&rsquo;t Sell</strong>: This is the core principle throughout. The art of investing lies not in complex market timing or stock picking, but in persistently holding high-quality assets for a lifetime, or even for generations.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Should Be Easy and Simple</strong>: The teacher uses an analogy: investing should only take 5-10 minutes a year and should not be a burden on one&rsquo;s life. If you make investing complicated, it&rsquo;s like adding a lot of chili oil to a simple clear noodle soup, which ruins the original flavor. Investors should spend more time enjoying life and being with their families.</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Spicy Beef Noodle&rdquo; Theory</strong>: When asked about asset allocation ratios, the teacher uses a vivid example. He believes that asking someone else how to allocate your assets is like asking them how much chili to add to your beef noodles because everyone&rsquo;s risk tolerance (how much spice they can handle) is different.
<ul>
<li><strong>Advice for Beginners</strong>: For novices or those unsure of their risk tolerance, the teacher suggests starting with &ldquo;clear-broth beef noodles&rdquo; (a conservative allocation), for example, 50% of assets in the market and 50% in cash.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy for Large Sums of Capital</strong>: It is recommended to divide it into three parts: buy 1/3 immediately, buy 1/3 in batches, and keep 1/3 as cash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Three Elements of Investment Psychology: Steadfastness, Patience, Faith</strong>: Once you have bought in, the next step is to cultivate a strong psychological mindset.
<ul>
<li><strong>Steadfastness</strong>: Not being affected by market fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Patience</strong>: Enduring painful periods of market decline is a necessary psychological quality.</li>
<li><strong>Faith</strong>: Believing in the long-term upward trend of the market is the path to reaching the highest realm of investing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="relative group">Building an &ldquo;Anti-fragile&rdquo; Investment Portfolio

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash and Market Volatility are &ldquo;Boosters&rdquo; for Assets</strong>: The teacher uses the concept of a &ldquo;boost converter&rdquo; in electronic circuits as an analogy. Market volatility is like an &ldquo;oscillator,&rdquo; and cash is like the &ldquo;electric current.&rdquo; Investing cash during a market downturn (oscillation) can effectively push asset values to new highs.</li>
<li><strong>Fragile vs. Anti-fragile</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Fragile Investment</strong>: For example, investing 100% in QQQ. If the market goes to zero, your assets go to zero. This is like a flower in a greenhouse that cannot withstand a storm.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-fragile Investment</strong>: For example, holding an index fund while keeping 30% in cash. Even if the market goes to zero, you still have 30% of your assets. This is like wildflowers everywhere, tenacious and able to survive and even thrive in harsh environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>An Anti-fragile Life</strong>: This concept applies not only to investing but also to life. For example, an employee who serves only one company is fragile and can be laid off at any time; whereas an Uber driver is anti-fragile, earning income as long as they drive. In the AI era, a pure software engineer becomes fragile, while experts in various industries who know how to use AI become anti-fragile.</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mathematical Explanation of Volatility Decay</strong>: The teacher reveals the characteristic of volatility decay in leveraged ETFs through calculation.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Assume QQQ falls for 45 consecutive days (-1% each day) and then rises for 46 consecutive days (+1% each day), it will eventually hit a new high.</li>
<li><strong>Comparison</strong>: Under the same conditions, if TQQQ falls for 45 consecutive days (-3% each day) and then rises for 46 consecutive days (+3% each day), its final price will still be below the initial starting point, unable to recover its losses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Who is Not Suitable for Leveraged Funds</strong>: Investors who are afraid of downturns and cannot withstand huge volatility should stay away from leveraged funds.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Use of Leveraged Funds</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Position Size Cannot Be Too Large</strong>: Investing a large sum of money into a high proportion of leveraged funds at once is very dangerous. In a long bear market, it could lead to assets going to zero with no chance of recovery.</li>
<li><strong>Suitable for Dollar-Cost Averaging</strong>: For investors with a continuous cash flow (like a monthly salary), making small, regular investments over decades is feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Warning</strong>: For retirees, a high leverage position could send you back to the workforce; for those currently employed, it could postpone your retirement plans indefinitely.</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Live in the Present, Eliminate Worry</strong>: The teacher guides everyone to ponder a question: &ldquo;If tomorrow were the end of your life, could you depart with a smile?&rdquo; He believes that true happiness comes from &ldquo;dying without regrets.&rdquo; If you have regrets in life, you should remedy them now, not spend your days worrying.</li>
<li><strong>Happiness is a Human Right</strong>: Investing should be joyful. If it causes you pain, don&rsquo;t participate. The value of life is not in its length, but in its depth and brightness.</li>

<li>Sharing:
<ol>
<li>A new member from last week, he is very grateful to Teacher James for his quick email response, which solved his problem with the app&rsquo;s operation.</li>
<li>He combines his insights from reading with the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy to create daily reminders for his investment principles: have capital, an investment philosophy, discipline, patience, and luck, combined with the teacher&rsquo;s &ldquo;hear, know, understand, believe, execute, firmly believe.&rdquo;</li>
<li>He quotes a conversation between Warren Buffett and Bill Gates to emphasize the principle of &ldquo;getting rich slowly,&rdquo; believing that patience is the most difficult but most crucial part of investing.</li>
<li>He shares his past principles for selling individual stocks (the reason for buying disappears, the target price is reached, the company faces irreversible difficulties), but now he has found a better option (QQQ) and is liquidating his individual stocks.</li>
<li>Regarding real estate, he believes that a house is also a financial product and proposes a view: &ldquo;Houses aren&rsquo;t bought by people, they&rsquo;re bought by money,&rdquo; with its price driven by market liquidity. He thinks the reason real estate returns are sometimes very high is due to high leverage (e.g., 5x or even 10x). His family owns a jewelry store, and he suggests that high-net-worth individuals can allocate a small amount to gold as a hedge against extreme risks.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Question: The &ldquo;Nine Scenarios&rdquo; PDF file he downloaded shows overlapping text and numbers on his phone. He asks if he can get the link again.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is likely a display issue with his personal phone, as there is no problem with the link itself. He suggests trying to open it on a computer or asking family or friends for help.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: He found that in the Chinese market, the management fee for the Harvest Nasdaq ETF (159501) is 0.2% lower than the 513100 recommended by the teacher, believing it will make a difference in long-term returns.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: The market is very efficient; this small fee difference is unlikely to bring extra profit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: How to change his parents&rsquo; investment mindset? He details the painful experience of his father suffering severe losses due to high-risk investments and being deceived by relatives. This has led his parents to be extremely risk-averse, preferring to deposit tens of millions of RMB in a bank for a fixed term (with an annual interest rate of only about 1.5%) and refusing to touch any funds. They even believe that real estate is the most secure asset. He feels confused and doesn&rsquo;t know if he should continue to persuade them.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t try to change them. Everyone&rsquo;s &ldquo;psychology of money&rdquo; is shaped by their life experiences. His parents&rsquo; views are &ldquo;correct&rdquo; in their world, a way to protect themselves from further harm. What you should do is manage your own money, invest your own funds, and become a big tree yourself. When you become very wealthy, your parents might see it, but changing them is not your responsibility. The most important thing is to let them live a peaceful and happy life.</li>

<ol>
<li>She believes investors should first have an attitude of self-responsibility instead of just seeking answers from the teacher. She spent over a year studying the teacher&rsquo;s courses very seriously, treating investing like a startup project, so her mindset is very stable.</li>
<li>She suggests new students (like Zhang Le) need to give themselves and their investment strategy some time, using three or four years of results to prove it to their parents, rather than trying to convince their family as soon as they start.</li>
<li>She has observed that the teacher is constantly changing and growing, giving different advice based on different students&rsquo; situations, such as once advising Taiwanese investors who needed stable cash flow to allocate a portion to high-dividend ETFs.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: He is in a good mood; his low tone of voice is because he is very calm inside, which is a very good state. He will not be influenced by the outside world and uses a joke about &ldquo;not wrestling with a pig&rdquo; to illustrate that for people who cannot understand, there is no need to argue, just say &ldquo;you are right.&rdquo; He emphasizes that he is growing and changing every day; otherwise, he would be stagnant.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Pursue inner peace (&ldquo;Where my heart is at peace, that is my home&rdquo;). When a person sees through many things and their heart is not troubled by any person or event, they will reach a very peaceful state. This requires nurturing one&rsquo;s spirituality, learning to &ldquo;separate&rdquo; from certain things, and taking back control of one&rsquo;s life, daring to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to things you don&rsquo;t want.</li>

<li>Question: Specific operational questions about stock pledges, such as how the interest rate is calculated, which account&rsquo;s assets it&rsquo;s based on, and whether the interest needs to be paid manually.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: These questions have been explained in detail in his previous videos and Excel sheets. The interest will automatically roll into the principal and does not need to be repaid manually. The interest rate depends on the asset size of the pledged account and the total assets of the entire household account. He advises Niu Fang to watch the series of videos specifically explaining stock pledges (especially episodes 004, 005), as it&rsquo;s difficult to fully understand just through Q&amp;A.</li>

<li>Question:
<ol>
<li>His current asset allocation is 4-3-3. Would it be safer to keep an additional 10% of cash on the side?</li>
<li>If he uses a Pledge Loan for living expenses and has a surplus each year (e.g., borrows $20k but only spends $15k), what should he do with the remaining $5,000?</li>
<li>When borrowing money, should he borrow a year&rsquo;s worth at once, or borrow monthly/as needed?</li>
<li>During a ROTH conversion, can he transfer stocks (in-kind) directly from a traditional IRA to a brokerage account, instead of selling and then transferring?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Keeping an extra 10% in cash is of course safer.</li>
<li>The remaining money can continue to be invested according to the 4-3-3 ratio.</li>
<li>Borrow as needed. For example, borrow only when you need to pay a bill this week; don&rsquo;t borrow in advance and let it sit.</li>
<li>Yes, stocks can be transferred in-kind. The brokerage will automatically adjust your cost basis based on the market value on the day of the transfer.</li>

<li>Having followed the teacher for nearly 6 years, financial freedom has given him time for philanthropy, such as teaching indigenous communities. He noticed an interesting phenomenon: people are afraid of their health indexes (like blood sugar) going up, but they hope their wealth index (QQQ) goes up every day.</li>
<li>He mentioned hearing Howard Marks quote Warren Buffett on the &ldquo;Macro Insights&rdquo; program and then add: &ldquo;You never bet against the United States, and you never bet against China.&rdquo; He wanted to hear the teacher&rsquo;s opinion.</li>
<li>He observed the tech talent war between the US and China. Regardless of where the talent flows, it ultimately converges in the tech giants, which is a long-term positive for QQQ.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: What Howard Marks means is that the first choice for investment is still the US, but you shouldn&rsquo;t be bearish on China either, because its potential is huge. Therefore, you can choose not to be &ldquo;long&rdquo; China, but you should never &ldquo;short&rdquo; China. The focus of investment should remain on the United States.</li>

<li>She finds it strange when some students say their assets are still &ldquo;underwater.&rdquo; She shares her own early mistake: listening to others and buying penny stocks that didn&rsquo;t rise for years. Later, she came to her senses, decisively &ldquo;cut her losses,&rdquo; sold the bad stocks, and switched to quality assets (QQQ, 2x leveraged NVDA, etc.).</li>
<li>She uses one of her accounts as an example: it suffered severe losses during the big drop in April, but after she decisively rebalanced her portfolio, the account&rsquo;s return reached 75% within 3 months, not only recovering all losses but also earning over $50,000.</li>
<li>Her mindset is now very mature. When she hears friends spending millions on luxury homes, she feels no emotional stir, believing that investing money in the stock market will yield higher returns in the long run.</li>

<p>All information is a demon or a monster; in 40 years, no information has ever been useful.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view emphasizes the importance of ignoring short-term market noise and sticking to a long-term investment strategy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asking me how to do your asset allocation is like asking me how much chili to add to your beef noodles.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view vividly illustrates the personalized nature of asset allocation. Everyone&rsquo;s risk tolerance is different, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What our asset allocation needs to achieve is a state of &ldquo;anti-fragility.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view introduces the core concept of &ldquo;anti-fragility,&rdquo; which is to build an investment portfolio that can survive and retain strength even in extreme risk scenarios (like the market going to zero).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to raise a child than to maintain a house.

<p>This view reflects on the phenomenon in modern society where people sacrifice their quality of life, and even the desire to have children, for the sake of real estate, emphasizing the importance of life&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He who can buy is a grandson, he who can sell is a father, but he who never sells is a god.

<p>This view uses a colloquial analogy to highly praise the ultimate state of investing: &ldquo;hold for the long term, never sell.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Houses aren&rsquo;t bought by people, they&rsquo;re bought by money.

<p>This view points out the essence of the real estate market, whose price fluctuations are primarily driven by monetary liquidity rather than just the housing needs of the population.</p>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t even manage the little bit of money in your hands, then don&rsquo;t go selling your house, and don&rsquo;t go taking out loans.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>

<p>This view advises investors to proceed step by step, starting with small amounts of capital and proving their ability to manage investments well before considering the use of larger-scale funds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investing can cultivate the mind.

<p>This session lucidly explains Teacher James&rsquo;s core investment philosophy and life wisdom. Starting from the simple principle of &ldquo;buy, hold, don&rsquo;t sell,&rdquo; it extends to the sophisticated strategy of using cash to build an &ldquo;anti-fragile&rdquo; portfolio, and then to a profound analysis of the risks of leveraged ETFs, providing investors with a clear guide to action. More importantly, the class transcends purely financial discussion, closely linking investment with personal psychological growth, family happiness, and inner peace. Through vivid analogies and real student cases, the teacher guides everyone to realize that true financial freedom is not just about numerical growth, but about breaking free from fear and anxiety, gaining the ability to control one&rsquo;s life and enjoy the present moment. At the same time, the teacher also reminds students that investment philosophy is constantly evolving and growing, requiring continuous learning and follow-up, otherwise, one becomes like a &ldquo;lost lamb,&rdquo; disconnected from the latest understanding.</p>

<p>The core message of this session is that ordinary investors should adopt a minimalist yet highly effective investment strategy: <strong>long-term holding of the Nasdaq-100 index fund (QQQ) and using asset-backed loans to cover living expenses. This allows them to enjoy the compound growth of their assets while legally avoiding capital gains tax and income tax.</strong> Through data and examples, James contrasts the inevitable losses of short-term traders with the steady wealth accumulation of long-term investors, emphasizing that &ldquo;Persistence, Patience, and Faith&rdquo; are the only things that matter in investing.</p>

<li><strong>Follow Multiple Platforms</strong>: Given the ever-changing social media landscape, it is recommended to follow CLEC on multiple platforms (e.g., YouTube, Clubhouse, Facebook) to avoid losing contact.</li>
<li><strong>The Market Always Reaches New Highs</strong>: For long-term investors, there is no &ldquo;highest point&rdquo; for the market, only &ldquo;higher.&rdquo; Buying at any time is a low point from a long-term perspective. The peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 now seems like an extremely low price.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Risk and Asset Allocation</strong>: Investing involves risk; the market could drop by 50%-70%. The best way to manage risk is not through frequent trading but by proper asset allocation and holding enough cash to withstand market volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Our Investment Choice</strong>: We focus solely on investing in the Nasdaq-100 index fund (QQQ). Page 11 of the course notes lists corresponding funds in various countries. Please do not ask about other complex funds; simplifying your investment is key.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Requires Extreme Optimism</strong>: You must firmly believe that the market will eventually go up, always looking on the bright side. Wealth is worth waiting for; investing requires patience.</li>

<li><strong>Final Result</strong>: The total loss amounted to NT$11.7 billion. This proves that short-term trading is almost a guaranteed losing game after all costs are deducted. Traders often only remember the &ldquo;good feeling&rdquo; of a single trade but overlook the total costs.</li>

<li><strong>Second Exploitation</strong>: You invest the after-tax money ($600,000), and any profits are then hit with capital gains tax (e.g., 25%).</li>
<li>Throughout a lifetime, assets are eroded by various taxes (VAT, estate tax, etc.), and you may only be left with a small fraction in the end.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Hold Assets</strong>: Hold appreciating stock assets (e.g., $1 million in QQQ).</li>
<li><strong>Borrow Against Assets</strong>: Use the stocks as collateral to borrow money from a bank for living expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Taxes</strong>: The borrowed money is <strong>debt</strong>, not <strong>income</strong>, so no tax is due. Meanwhile, the stock assets held as collateral continue to grow in the market. This is the most favorable wealth-building cycle in the world.</li>

<li><strong>The Most Important Thing in Investing</strong>: Adhere to these three things: &ldquo;<strong>Persistence, Patience, and Faith</strong>.&rdquo; Everything else (how to buy, how to sell) is unimportant. We only teach how to buy, not how to sell.</li>
<li><strong>Knowing When to Stop Brings Stability</strong>: Quoting a share from student Barin, James emphasizes the importance of &ldquo;knowing when to stop.&rdquo; This is a form of self-restraint after reflection, knowing when to apply the brakes between greed and fear and avoiding maxing out leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Getting Rich Once is Enough</strong>: One only needs to get rich slowly once in a lifetime. True wealth is not about how much money you have, but about living with ease and not being constrained by money. A higher realm is to help others achieve wealth together.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to Spend Money Smartly</strong>: The best state in life is to be <strong>&ldquo;in heaven, with money in the bank&rdquo;</strong> (meaning your money runs out just as you pass away). Young people don&rsquo;t need to invest every penny; they can plan their retirement goals and enjoy life appropriately, making their youth more meaningful.</li>
<li><strong>Investing is Like Riding a Cable Car</strong>: The growth of our assets is like riding a cable car. Although there are bumps and shakes along the way, the overall trend is upward. We just need to sit tight, enjoy the scenery, and live our lives.</li>

You can&rsquo;t teach your children when to sell TSMC; they might panic and sell at a low point. In contrast, the strategy for index funds (hold long-term, never sell) is simple, clear, and easy to pass on. Even Warren Buffett advised his family to invest in the SPY index fund after his death because his stock-picking ability cannot be inherited.</li>

<li>Question: I run a small business in Taiwan, pay a lot in taxes, and the work is very hard. I want to retire and put all my assets into 00662, but I&rsquo;m afraid of feeling insecure without cash flow. What should I do?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: First, you need to calculate your business&rsquo;s <strong>net profit margin</strong>. If your net profit margin isn&rsquo;t significantly higher than QQQ&rsquo;s annualized return (around 18%, say, less than 30%), then continuing the business doesn&rsquo;t make much sense, as you&rsquo;re taking on huge risks and hardship for a lower return. Regarding the cash flow issue, you can solve it with <strong>asset allocation</strong>: hold 30% of your total assets (or enough to cover 15 years of living expenses) in cash or cash equivalents (like 00865B), and invest the remaining 70% in 00662. This way, you&rsquo;ll have enough cash to live on, while the stock portion continues to grow. In the long run, you won&rsquo;t run out of assets.</li>

First, you should find a brokerage that offers a <strong>Roth SEP IRA</strong>. If you can&rsquo;t find one, then <strong>do not contribute to the SEP IRA</strong>. It&rsquo;s better to put the money in a regular Brokerage Account. Assets in a brokerage account are never taxed until they are sold, whereas money in a Traditional account is subject to Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) and taxes after age 75. As for allocation, all Roth accounts can buy QQQ. For the Roth IRA, given its small amount and long-term dollar-cost averaging nature, you could consider the more aggressive <strong>TQQQ</strong>.</li>

<li>Question 1: An investment scenario: A brother invests 10 million and withdraws 200,000 annually. The market then drops 50%, leaving his assets at 5.8 million. At this point, his younger brother invests 5.8 million with the same allocation. Can the younger brother also withdraw 200,000 annually?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>Yes</strong>. Because the younger brother entered the market after a major crash when the risk was lower, he is &ldquo;luckier.&rdquo; The older brother initially used a low 2% withdrawal rate precisely to create a buffer for such a crash. After the risk event has occurred, the younger brother&rsquo;s withdrawal rate, although seemingly higher (about 3.45%), is based on a different risk foundation, so it is feasible.</li>

<li>Question 2: The Taiwan dollar has appreciated, making it seem like 00662 hasn&rsquo;t recovered to its previous high. Can I, for psychological purposes, add back the currency loss and consider it to have broken even?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>No</strong>. You cannot use a hypothetical, favorable exchange rate to calculate your asset value; this creates high risk. Investments should be based on their current, actual value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: If a geopolitical war happens in Taiwan, our cash equivalents (like 00865B) are also in the market. Is there a risk?

<li>Question 1: I&rsquo;m retired and enjoy day trading in my retirement account for fun. I find it entertaining, is this okay?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: If you&rsquo;re just doing it for &ldquo;fun&rdquo; and are willing to pay the &ldquo;ticket price&rdquo; (i.e., giving up the massive potential returns from long-term holding of QQQ), then of course you can. But this is just making small money while giving up the opportunity to make big money. For example, a $100,000 principal held for 40 years could become $200 million; day trading can&rsquo;t achieve that.</li>

<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: As long as you are still working and your monthly income can fully cover the loan interest and living expenses, this ratio is fine.

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: You need to resolve the human issue through communication yourself. But the <strong>top priority must be to make your family&rsquo;s cash flow positive</strong>. When taking out the loan, you should choose a long enough term to ensure that the monthly payment plus living expenses is less than your monthly income. You absolutely must not invest when your cash flow is negative. After solving the cash flow problem, you can then allocate the borrowed funds using a 433 (40% QQQ, 30% QLD, 30% cash) or another configuration.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>We borrow money to spend without paying taxes, and our money in the stock market assets grows forever, always up, how great is that! This is the best thing in the world.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote brilliantly summarizes the core advantage of using asset-backed loans for consumption: achieving tax exemption for spending while enjoying the compound growth of assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We only need to get rich once in our lifetime. We don&rsquo;t need to be rich from the start; just get rich slowly.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentence conveys the patience and calm mindset of long-term investing, opposing the speculative psychology of rushing for success and emphasizing that wealth accumulation is a continuous and steady process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The highest skill in investing is to exist in a state of &rsquo;non-eventfulness,&rsquo; where the market basically doesn&rsquo;t exist&hellip; The market&rsquo;s ups and downs have nothing to do with us.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This describes the ultimate psychological state a long-term investor should aspire to: being completely unaffected by short-term market fluctuations because their investment strategy is independent of short-term movements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you look at anything from a long-term perspective, you will see it clearly.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In answering how to see the essence of things, James emphasizes the importance of the time dimension. A decision may seem reasonable in the present, but when viewed over a span of decades, the conclusion might be completely different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can make 20 billion from short-term trading, can you really get that 20 billion? If you have 1 million now and you can&rsquo;t get 20 billion in 60 years, then don&rsquo;t do it, you&rsquo;re wasting your time. Because you can have 20 billion by doing nothing.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When discussing short-term trading with a student, James uses a high-impact numerical comparison to reveal the enormous opportunity cost difference between short-term trading and long-term index holding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned one sentence now, which is, &lsquo;I might be wrong&rsquo;&hellip; Only when we acknowledge our ignorance do we begin to learn.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the session, this quote shared by James demonstrates the humility and open-mindedness of an investment master, emphasizing that admitting ignorance is the starting point for continuous learning and progress.</p>

<p>This session was an intensive training in mindset and strategy. James once again emphasized the overwhelming advantage of the core strategy of long-term holding of index funds (QQQ) and used detailed data to reveal the inevitable failure of short-term trading. The highlight of this session was the clear explanation of the &ldquo;wealthy&rsquo;s tax strategy&rdquo;—asset-backed loans—providing investors with a path to achieve both wealth growth and tax optimization. The entire session was imbued with the investment philosophy of &ldquo;Persistence, Patience, and Faith,&rdquo; and through interactive Q&amp;A with numerous students, it addressed a series of specific issues from asset allocation, retirement planning, and children&rsquo;s education to international tax matters, vividly demonstrating how to integrate investment wisdom into real-life decision-making.</p>

<p>The core theme of this session is to emphasize that long-term investors should ignore short-term market volatility and firmly believe in the market&rsquo;s perpetual upward trend. Teacher James points out that having funds out of the market is the biggest risk, and investors should enter the market as soon as possible, adopting a &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, and never sell&rdquo; strategy. By debunking common market prediction indicators (like the Buffett Indicator) and analyzing asset allocation, he aims to help investors build a solid investment mindset to achieve long-term wealth growth.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market Volatility Doesn&rsquo;t Concern Me</strong>: For long-term investors, daily market fluctuations, global situations, tariff wars, etc., should not influence investment decisions. The market hitting new highs for three consecutive days proves the importance of staying in the market.</li>
<li><strong>Being Out of the Market is the Biggest Risk</strong>: Many people exit the market fearing a downturn, but waiting for a correction might mean never getting back in. Keeping funds out of the market and missing out on gains is a far greater risk than a short-term decline.</li>
<li><strong>Predictions are Useless, Making Money is What Matters</strong>: There are many who make correct market predictions, but the ones who actually make money are those who ignore the predictions and stay invested.</li>
<li><strong>The Market Always Goes Up</strong>: This is the core belief a long-term investor must have. Historical data proves that in the long run, the market only goes up and will always reach new highs. Investors should always be extremely optimistic and face the sun.</li>
<li><strong>Review the Past, Preview the Future</strong>: The teacher advises students, especially new ones, to watch videos from the market crashes at the end of 2018, March 2020, and in 2022 to learn how to react correctly during times of panic and to mentally prepare for future market volatility.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Risk in Long-Term Investing</strong>: Looking at a century of history, buying at any point and holding for the long term has always been profitable. However, short-term volatility can be immense, with potential drops of 50% or even 80%, so one must focus on long-term returns.</li>
<li><strong>The Nature of Your Funds Dictates Your Investment</strong>: Money needed for the short term (like tuition or a down payment for a house) must absolutely not be invested in the stock market; it should be kept as cash. Only long-term funds that you won&rsquo;t touch for 10-20 years are suitable for investment.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Asset Allocation</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Seek Stability Before Returns</strong>: Investment allocation should prioritize psychological stability. It is inadvisable for people to switch from an aggressive allocation (e.g., 442) to a conservative one (e.g., 433) when they can&rsquo;t handle the pressure during a market drop (like in April of this year).</li>
<li><strong>A Conservative Beta Value</strong>: It is recommended that an investor&rsquo;s Beta value not exceed 1.0. If you think you can handle 1.0, it&rsquo;s better to subtract 0.2 and adopt a Beta of 0.8, which might be more suitable.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Sufficient Cash</strong>: It&rsquo;s advisable to keep at least 30% in cash. For example, a portfolio of 70% QQQ + 30% Cash.</li>
<li><strong>Gradual Increase in Leverage</strong>: Newcomers to the market can start without using leveraged funds. During a market dip, you can use a small amount of cash (e.g., 2% of assets) to buy a 2x leveraged fund, thereby gradually building a leveraged position and allowing the Beta value to increase naturally as the market rises. This is like riding a smooth, high-class train rather than a bumpy race car.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Case: Currency Exchange Impact on 00662 vs. QLD</strong>
<ul>
<li>A student asked if the performance of 00662 (Fubon NASDAQ-100) lagged behind QLD due to the appreciation of the Taiwan Dollar (TWD).</li>
<li><strong>Teacher&rsquo;s Analysis</strong>: Comparisons must be made in the same currency. Assuming the exchange rate was 33 when investing in QQQ and is now 29, the exchange loss is 12%. Over the past 5 years, QLD&rsquo;s performance was about 128%, and 00662&rsquo;s was about 114%. However, after deducting the 12% currency exchange loss from QLD&rsquo;s 128%, its performance becomes about 112%, which is actually lower than 00662&rsquo;s 114%. The conclusion is that their performances are essentially the same; don&rsquo;t be misled by nominal figures in different currencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Debunking the &ldquo;Buffett Indicator&rdquo; Myth</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Many people use the &ldquo;Total Stock Market Capitalization / GDP&rdquo; ratio to judge if the market is overheated, which is wrong.</li>
<li><strong>GDP is a flow concept</strong>: It only measures the new value added in the current year.</li>
<li><strong>Market Cap is a stock concept</strong>: It includes the value of all of a company&rsquo;s historical investments and accumulated value.</li>
<li>Comparing a changing flow metric to a cumulative stock metric is like comparing apples and oranges; it&rsquo;s completely illogical.</li>
<li>Warren Buffett himself rarely mentions this indicator and emphasizes not to use a single indicator to judge the market. Many &ldquo;pundits&rdquo; and bloggers on the market abuse this concept just to get attention, like mindless &ldquo;parrots.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Beware of Investment Scams</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Teacher James <strong>solemnly declares</strong> that he provides <strong>completely free</strong> and <strong>voluntary teaching</strong>. He will never contact students privately, let alone offer financial services for a 1% fee or any other charge.</li>
<li>Anyone who uses his name on platforms like LINE or WeChat to contact you, claiming they can manage your finances for a fee, is a <strong>scammer</strong>.</li>
<li>In the US, it is illegal for an uncertified financial advisor to charge fees. The teacher stresses that no one cares more about your assets than you do; you must manage your investments yourself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Awakening to Capitalism</strong>: Teacher James puts forward a sharp point: laborers who go to work in modern society are, in essence, &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; of capitalism. The purpose of his teaching is to awaken everyone&rsquo;s &ldquo;capitalist consciousness,&rdquo; to learn to use capitalism to become capitalists, rather than being enslaved by it. (Refer to video <code>00315</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Ultimate Goals in Life</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Health and Longevity are Fundamental</strong>: Longevity is the path to wealth, and health is the mother of happiness. He reminds everyone to get health check-ups (like CT scans).</li>
<li><strong>Happiness is the purpose of life</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth is just the icing on the cake</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>The Principle of Borrowing to Invest</strong>:
<ul>
<li>For money borrowed according to proper principles, <strong>never think about paying it back</strong>.</li>
<li>Once you repay the loan, your risk (Beta value) will immediately increase. For example, an investor with 50% cash and 50% QQQ (Beta=0.5) who uses cash to repay a loan will see their Beta value skyrocket, greatly increasing their risk.</li>
<li>Having cash on hand gives you the confidence to face risks.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is a 65-year-old veteran investor who lost tens of millions in the stock market twice. After starting to learn Teacher James&rsquo;s philosophy after the Chinese New Year, although he had doubts about some points (about 10-15%), he found through deeper study that the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy is continuously refined and has deep logic.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: The market often says, &ldquo;If you miss the best few days of gains, your annualized return will drop significantly.&rdquo; What is the specific definition of this &ldquo;best time for gains&rdquo;?</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Regarding &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; versus &ldquo;mindless rebalancing,&rdquo; if the market is still rising at the end of the year, will rebalancing then cause one to miss out on subsequent gains?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>On Missing Up Days</strong>: This is precisely why it&rsquo;s important &ldquo;not to leave the market.&rdquo; Attempting to time the market will very likely cause you to miss the days with the biggest gains, leading to long-term returns far worse than those of an investor who &ldquo;never sells.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>On Rebalancing</strong>: Attempting &ldquo;smart,&rdquo; irregular rebalancing based on market movements is <strong>active investing</strong>, which cannot be taught because everyone&rsquo;s judgment criteria are different (add at a 10% drop? or 20%?). This approach can deplete your cash in an extreme market (like a three-year decline), leading to bankruptcy. Therefore, the simplest, safest, and most replicable method is to <strong>rebalance once a year</strong>. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that you didn&rsquo;t add more at the low point in April this year, because by the end of the year, your entire portfolio will still have appreciated significantly.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Praised the NotebookLM system created by student &ldquo;Chen Feng&rdquo; and the teacher&rsquo;s ChatGPT tool as being very useful.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: For a portfolio of 60% QQQ, 10% QLD, and 30% cash, what is the Beta value? (Teacher&rsquo;s reply: 0.6 + 0.1*2 = 0.8)</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Can one use technical indicators (like the 200-day moving average) to assist in decision-making—becoming conservative when the price is below the average and aggressive when it&rsquo;s above?</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: Are people like Apple CEO Tim Cook considered capitalists or laborers?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>On Technical Indicators</strong>: Completely unnecessary. In the recent V-shaped recovery, using a 200-day moving average strategy would have had you sell and buy back at roughly the same point. Not only would you not have made a profit, you might have lost money on transaction fees, underperforming a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; strategy.</li>
<li><strong>On Tim Cook</strong>: He is a <strong>laborer</strong>, a very highly paid &ldquo;slave.&rdquo; His wealth comes from his salary (including stock options), not from returns on his own invested capital. True capitalists do not have to go to work.</li>

<li>Influenced by family, she previously invested in real estate. Her property in Japan yielded poor returns due to the yen&rsquo;s major depreciation over the last decade.</li>
<li>Shared a success story: she took out a home loan of 8 million TWD four or five years ago and didn&rsquo;t pay it off early. Instead, she invested the funds in ETFs and made a profit of four to five million, deeply understanding the benefits of investing with borrowed money.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: What should she do with the Japanese Yen she holds?</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: She has about $200,000 USD in cash (cost basis ~32 TWD/USD) and has already invested $100,000 in US stocks (QQQ/SPY/VT). Now she doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with the remaining cash because she heard the teacher say there are tax issues for Taiwanese people buying US stocks.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Handling the Yen</strong>: Immediately, right now, exchange it for TWD and buy 00662. Don&rsquo;t worry about the exchange rate loss, because the potential return from the stock market is far greater than currency fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Handling the USD Assets</strong>: Again, ignore the exchange rate. For Taiwanese investors, the best approach is to sell the holdings in the US brokerage, transfer the funds back to Taiwan, and buy 00662 with all of it to avoid future estate tax issues. In the long run, the exchange rates for entering and exiting the market will average out, so there&rsquo;s no need for excessive worry.</li>

All new funds in the future should be invested in QQQ. In the future, Bitcoin might be used as collateral like gold, so you may not need to sell it.

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is 65 and retired. During the recent downturn, his allocation was too aggressive (Beta 1.1), and he had no cash to add at the bottom. He has now adjusted to a Beta of 0.9 (70% QQQ, 10% QLD, 20% Cash).</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Is there a mechanical rule for deploying cash during a major market drop? For example, investing one-third of the cash when the market drops 20%?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This falls under active management. If you must do it, you could consider this: when the market drops 10% (happens almost every year), you can add more once; when it drops 20% (happens every few years), you can add more again. If it continues to fall, you must be very cautious, as it could be a major bear market. At that point, you should switch to a defensive posture, not continue to add. The key is to <strong>never run out of cash</strong>, and the goal of adding to your position is to <strong>maintain your original Beta value (0.9)</strong>, not to raise it.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is due to the <strong>volatility decay</strong> characteristic of leveraged ETFs. In volatile and declining markets, the drop in leveraged ETFs will be more than a multiple of the index&rsquo;s drop, and their recovery is also slower. This is why a full position in leveraged funds is not recommended. For those holding leveraged funds, adding to your position during a major market drop can help you break even faster. For those with a salary, you should normally buy QQQ and use your salary to buy TQQQ during major market dips.</li>

<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: <strong>Safety is always the number one priority</strong>. He quoted a police officer&rsquo;s advice: when faced with a violent attack, the first reaction is to <strong>run</strong>, not to fight back. We must teach our children that defending justice cannot come at the cost of their own physical well-being; we are not martyrs. One can verbally intervene, but if the other person ignores it or shows violent tendencies, one must leave immediately and protect oneself. Society will teach them their lesson; our children don&rsquo;t need to take that risk.</li>

<p>This point was central to the entire session. The teacher repeatedly emphasized that compared to the risk of a short-term market decline, the risk of investors exiting out of fear and thereby missing out on huge long-term returns is far greater.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today&rsquo;s laborers who go to work are like the cotton pickers brought from Africa to America in the past. All who work in factories today are slaves to capitalism.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very sharp and thought-provoking view from the teacher, aimed at awakening people to the nature of capitalism and encouraging them to become capitalists through investment, thereby escaping the status of a &ldquo;laborer.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Longevity is the path to wealth, happiness is the purpose of life, health is the mother of happiness, and wealth is just the icing on the cake.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The teacher shared his philosophy of life, emphasizing what is truly important. Wealth is meant to serve a better life, not be the ultimate goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone says, &ldquo;Pay me 1% and I can be your investment advisor&rdquo;&hellip; that is a scam.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The teacher directly used the language of scammers as an example to strongly remind all students that anyone impersonating him and offering paid financial advice is a scam, urging everyone to protect their assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t defend justice with your own body; we are not martyrs.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the core advice given in response to the question about how a child should face school bullying. He stressed that under any circumstances, personal safety is the highest priority, teaching children to uphold their sense of justice while also learning to protect themselves wisely.</p>

<p>This session once again stressed the core discipline of long-term investing: ignore short-term market volatility and firmly believe in the market&rsquo;s long-term upward trend. By analyzing asset allocation, the use of leveraged funds, and debunking common myths like the Buffett Indicator, Teacher James pointed out a simple yet effective path to wealth growth. The Q&amp;A session was rich in content, covering profound discussions from specific investment strategies (like rebalancing timing and leveraged fund allocation) to life philosophies (such as dealing with bullying and the nature of capitalism). The central idea of the entire session is that investors should build a strong psychological foundation, focus on controllable investment principles, and simultaneously pursue a life of health, happiness, and longevity, viewing wealth as a tool for a better life, not the ultimate goal.</p>

      <description>In this session, Teacher James emphasizes the importance of maintaining a long-term optimistic mindset in investing, sharing a transcendent attitude of &amp;#39;it has nothing to do with me&amp;#39; when facing market volatility. He provides a detailed interpretation of the core principles of asset allocation, especially the strategic significance of cash reserves, and discusses how to adjust investment strategies at different life stages. Additionally, he recommends books and films to improve one&amp;#39;s state of mind and answers specific questions from students about asset allocation, pledging, retirement planning, career choices, and preventing financial fraud.</description>

<p>This session revolves around &ldquo;The Long-term Practice of Investment Mindset and Asset Allocation.&rdquo; The core message is that investors should cultivate a transcendent mindset of &ldquo;it has nothing to do with me,&rdquo; remaining calm in the face of external factors like international situations and economic data, and firmly believing that the market will trend upwards and reach new highs in the long run. It emphasizes achieving financial freedom through reasonable asset allocation (e.g., Nasdaq 100 index funds combined with ample cash) and passive management, and drawing strength for life and investment from wisdom such as &ldquo;I might be wrong&rdquo; and &ldquo;life is worthwhile.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Market Irrelevance Theory</strong>: Macro factors like international situations, financial reports, economic data, and interest rate decisions have no direct correlation with an individual investor&rsquo;s long-term success. One should adopt a mindset of &ldquo;it all has nothing to do with me.&rdquo; Market volatility is normal and not worth worrying about, as you can&rsquo;t control it anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Always Be Extremely Optimistic</strong>: Firmly believe that the market will inevitably rise and set new historical highs in the long run. Investing requires patience, and wealth is worth the trouble and the wait.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended Books/Films for the Mind</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>&ldquo;I Might Be Wrong&rdquo;</strong> (The Illumination of a Forest Sage): This book recounts the life insights of a man (from Europe, as the teacher recalls) who spent over a decade (perhaps 14 or 16 years) as a monk in a Thai forest. The core takeaway is to tell yourself &ldquo;I might be wrong&rdquo; three times before arguing or getting angry, to calm your mind and self-reflect. It emphasizes practicing the state of &ldquo;no-self&rdquo; and learning to live harmoniously with all kinds of people.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Life is Worthwhile&rdquo;</strong> (Audiobook): This book contains the professional insights and life experiences of an elderly female Japanese psychiatrist. Through numerous patient cases, it explores how many psychological barriers stem from &ldquo;attachment.&rdquo; Her life experiences (e.g., maintaining a less-than-perfect marriage until her husband passed away in his 70s so that both parents could stand on the stage at their children&rsquo;s weddings) are thought-provoking. The core message is to let go of attachments and appreciate life. The teacher believes that, aside from the somewhat fatalistic view on marriage, the book is very beneficial for one&rsquo;s outlook on life.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Boredom is the Highest State</strong>: &ldquo;Hold stocks in your hand, but not their prices in your heart.&rdquo; True investing should be boring, requiring only 5 minutes of operation and review each year. If it feels exciting, you&rsquo;re likely speculating or gambling, as if you&rsquo;re in Las Vegas.</li>
<li><strong>Coping with Anxiety</strong>: Don&rsquo;t create your own troubles in life. If you can handle something, face it and get it done. If you can&rsquo;t, since it&rsquo;s beyond your control, let it go without worry.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Importance of Cash is King</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>For Retirees</strong>: It&rsquo;s recommended to hold total assets equivalent to 50 times your annual expenses. Of this, 30% of your assets (equivalent to 15 years of living expenses) should be held in cash or short-term treasury bonds. With 15 years of living expenses in cash, nothing in the world concerns you.</li>
<li><strong>For Working Individuals</strong>: You usually can&rsquo;t hold 15 years&rsquo; worth of cash. You should continue to save and invest, and the world&rsquo;s affairs also have nothing to do with you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Ultimate Perspective of Life</strong>: In life-or-death moments (like the last day of your life), wealth, stock losses, and asset security become irrelevant. Therefore, don&rsquo;t worry excessively about things you can&rsquo;t control in daily life.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Asset Allocation Principles (Pledged Investing)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Beta Control</strong>: The initial Beta of your asset allocation should not exceed 1.0. For example, a 40% non-leveraged fund (QQQ) + 30% leveraged fund (QLD) + 30% cash (433 allocation) is an aggressive setup. A 40% QQQ + 20% QLD + 40% cash (424 allocation, Beta 0.8) is also a solid choice. Aggressive allocations like 442, where the Beta might exceed 1.2, are not recommended at the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Proportion Limits</strong>: The market value of the leveraged fund should not exceed that of the non-leveraged fund, nor should it exceed the cash position.</li>
<li><strong>Prudent Choices</strong>: Even without using leveraged funds, a pledged allocation like 70% QQQ + 30% cash, or 60% QQQ + 40% cash, can withstand risk tests. Prioritize stability, with returns being secondary.</li>
<li><strong>Coping with Extreme Scenarios</strong>: This allocation must be able to withstand a market downturn lasting 10 years, like the one in 2000 (in reality, it took about 13-15 years for the market to fully recover and significantly surpass its previous high).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Role of Cash</strong>: Cash is key to protecting the safety of your long-term investments (the &ldquo;army&rdquo; of non-leveraged funds and the &ldquo;marines&rdquo; of leveraged funds).</li>
<li><strong>The Worst-Case Scenario Principle</strong>: Envision the worst possible situation and create a plan to deal with it. Once you have a solution, anxiety will diminish. For example, if you get laid off, the worst case is being unable to find a job for a year. Plan how to prepare funds and how to find a temporary job for cash flow. For disasters beyond your control that you can&rsquo;t prevent (like a nuclear war, as Buffett mentioned, or a meteor hitting Earth), worrying is useless, so let it go.</li>
<li><strong>A Long-Term Investor&rsquo;s Perspective</strong>: Don&rsquo;t fear market downturns; instead, fear that the market rises too quickly, preventing you from buying enough (like the market&rsquo;s rapid rebound after the tariff war). Downturns are buying opportunities. Resolutely do not sell core assets (like QQQ, 00662). It takes multiple experiences (e.g., 7 major slumps) to learn to buy the dip. You can choose not to buy, but you must never sell.</li>
<li><strong>Discipline for Leveraged Investing</strong>: A reminder that for leveraged investing, the initial cash allocation must exceed 30% (40% is also fine), with limits on the proportion of leveraged funds and a Beta not exceeding 1.0. This is emphasized because too many people ask the same questions and make allocation mistakes.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Importance of Accompaniment</strong>: Investment success isn&rsquo;t just talk; it requires long-term accompaniment and guidance. Teacher James is dedicated to this, hoping to awaken more people to capitalism and that his followers will pass on the philosophy, change the world, and free themselves and those around them from financial worries.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Resources</strong>: Newcomers are advised to start with videos 00451 &ldquo;An Investment Lecture for Value Investors,&rdquo; 00398, 399, 400, 401, etc., and understand them in the context of the current market. The main recommendation is the Nasdaq 100 index fund (like QQQ), combined with cash or short-term treasury bonds. Relevant handouts and links will be provided on the Clubhouse message board and in the pinned comment on YouTube.</li>
<li><strong>Call for Promotion</strong>: We hope everyone will subscribe, leave comments, and like our content on all platforms where you find our channel. Subscriptions and likes help promote the videos to a wider audience. Although the click-through rate is not high (about 5.5%), it is still an important way to spread the word.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: I&rsquo;ve watched every episode this year and find that the Clubhouse platform has the most comprehensive information and links. YouTube Music is also a good experience, but finding consecutive episodes on YouTube can be a bit inconvenient. I hope there could be a central place for all handouts and links shared by the teacher.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: The YouTube channel has playlists, such as the &ldquo;Weekly ClubHouse&rdquo; series which already has 39 entries and can be played in order. There is also a playlist for short videos with 595 clips. Using playlists makes it easy to listen continuously.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 1: In the smart rebalancing model you mentioned, during an uptrend, 30% of the profits from QLD are moved to SGOV, and during a downtrend, 2% of SGOV is moved to QLD. Is this 2% related to the previously mentioned &ldquo;using 2% of your assets annually for living expenses&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: In smart rebalancing, during an up year, you move 30% of that year&rsquo;s appreciation from the leveraged fund (like QLD) into cash (like SGOV). In a down year, you move 2% of your total assets (equivalent to a portion of living expenses or a planned investment amount) from cash into the leveraged fund. For retirees, the core principle is to ensure your cash reserve can last at least 15 years, because after a market peak, it might take up to 15 years for a non-leveraged fund (QQQ) to have a high probability of doubling. For example, if you start with 50% cash and 50% QQQ, and the market falls for several years while you rebalance, you must ensure the remaining cash can still cover living expenses for (15 years - years passed). A strategy of 70% QQQ + 30% cash, without touching the cash for 15 years, is another option. The key is the &ldquo;15-year cash buffer.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: The total assets of the U.S. are about $200 trillion (200T), with the stock market being about $50T. What comprises the other $150T? Is there an index to track the flow of funds between the stock market and cash?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The remaining assets include real estate, mineral resources, various physical assets, etc. There is currently no specific public index tracking this kind of macro fund flow. The total assets of the U.S. are enormous and grow substantially each year (e.g., by $20-30T). Its debt (about $36T) is not a major issue relative to its total assets and annual growth, so the public shouldn&rsquo;t worry too much. In comparison, an individual investor&rsquo;s balance sheet risk might be higher. As for the claim that Social Security is going bankrupt, I&rsquo;ve been hearing that for 40 years. There&rsquo;s no need to worry; the U.S. can solve it. The Social Security fund itself is more like a pay-as-you-go system, where contributions from new workers pay for retirees&rsquo; benefits, rather than a massive investment fund.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: I am an investor from mainland China and also a Christian. Last year, I sold a primary residence and invested the funds. I feel like a steward of money with a responsibility to manage it well. I originally planned to dollar-cost average into USD and have opened an account in Hong Kong. After listening to your classes recently, I&rsquo;ve been deeply moved by your selfless dedication and strongly agree with your investment philosophy. My current plan is to use my wife&rsquo;s and my annual $50,000 foreign exchange quotas to transfer funds to Longbridge Securities and gradually buy assets like QQQ. I&rsquo;ve also bought some 513100 in the domestic A-share market. Our total capital is about 3 million RMB. I plan to deploy most of it in Longbridge Securities within six months, keeping a small portion domestically. Is this a reasonable approach? I considered using HSBC for pledging, but the threshold is high (over 1 million HKD), transferring from Longbridge to HSBC has fees, and HSBC&rsquo;s management fees might be high. I plan to wait until I have enough capital to transfer it to HSBC all at once.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Your approach is reasonable. You can first accumulate assets in Longbridge Securities and then transfer them in one go when your capital reaches HSBC&rsquo;s pledging threshold or when you are ready to pledge. This is more economical. Investors in mainland China generally lack financial literacy; many get hurt after entering the market blindly and then stay away, including Kevin&rsquo;s own wife who suffered losses in the stock market in 2015 due to the wrong philosophy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing 2: I deeply resonate with your sharing on both the &ldquo;technique&rdquo; (术) of investing and the &ldquo;way&rdquo; (道) of life. I also listen to Pastor Stephen Tong&rsquo;s sermons and have many reflections. Thank you for your efforts. You&rsquo;ve mentioned Confucius and Zhuangzi; I was wondering if you&rsquo;ve come across Pastor Tong&rsquo;s sharing on these topics?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Thank you for sharing, Kevin. I haven&rsquo;t specifically listened to Pastor Stephen Tong&rsquo;s sharing, but I maintain an open and learning attitude towards various religious and philosophical thoughts (Christianity, Buddhism, etc.). If it&rsquo;s recommended to me, I&rsquo;ll listen, as I believe all great truths are interconnected. The core of investing is this: we own companies (like the 100 companies represented by QQQ), and we shouldn&rsquo;t sell them easily just because of external opinions on their stock prices (Mr. Market&rsquo;s neurotic quotes). Focus on long-term holding and accumulating shares, just like accumulating real estate, but with better liquidity. Investing should be passive and simple. You only need to spend 5 minutes at the end of the year (e.g., Dec 31st or the market open on Jan 2nd or 3rd) to rebalance once. Avoid emotional trading based on short-term market fluctuations, which will only get you into trouble, like being influenced by Mr. Market and becoming a &ldquo;lunatic&rsquo;s lunatic.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Question 1: In your Excel model for maintenance margin calculation, are leveraged funds excluded? Is this also the case in Taiwan?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes, in the models of U.S. brokerages, leveraged funds usually cannot be used to calculate maintenance margin because they cannot be pledged themselves. If a Taiwanese brokerage allows leveraged funds to be pledged, its risk tolerance would be better, and the calculated maintenance margin might include the leveraged portion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: My investment journey has been: 0056 (high-dividend) -&gt; 0050 (Taiwan 50) -&gt; 00646 (S&amp;P 500 ETF) -&gt; 00662 (Nasdaq 100 ETF). I recently re-listened to one of your earlier sessions (possibly 00451 or another early one) where you mentioned that if one doesn&rsquo;t have enough money, they could buy 0056 and live off the 4% annual dividend for retirement. Did I misunderstand? It feels like I&rsquo;ve come full circle.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You didn&rsquo;t mishear. Different strategies apply to different life stages and asset sizes. If you are still relatively young, you can use a 433 (QQQ non-leveraged, QLD leveraged, cash) allocation for aggressive growth. If you are close to retirement and your assets are not enough to support a 2% annual withdrawal (i.e., total assets 50 times your annual expenses)—for example, you need 1 million per year but have less than 50 million, maybe only 30 million—then a less volatile option like 00646 (S&amp;P 500) with a 3% annual withdrawal might be a choice. If your assets are even smaller (e.g., only 20 or 25 million), then a high-dividend ETF like 0056, withdrawing the 4% dividend to supplement your living expenses, is a reluctant but realistic option. The 0056 plan is for special cases of insufficient assets; the mainstream, ideal allocation is still centered around QQQ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: If I am about to retire and the market happens to be in a major downturn, at a low point in the model, how should I reposition my assets and plan my living expense withdrawals?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You should base your 2% annual living expense calculation on the total asset value at the market&rsquo;s peak before your retirement. For example, if you had 50 million at the peak and planned to spend 1 million a year. Even if the market then drops for three years and your assets shrink to 25 million, you should still try to maintain your 1 million annual living standard (if your cash reserves allow). Because the market has already been down for several years, the risk is actually lower. You&rsquo;ve passed a three-year window, and you should trust that the market will recover in the coming cycle (15 years minus the years passed).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 4: I am a Taiwanese investor and I buy 00662 with TWD. If the TWD appreciates significantly in the future, will my assets shrink as a result?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: In the long run (e.g., 20, 30, or even over 40 years), the impact of currency fluctuations tends to approach zero. For instance, the TWD/USD exchange rate has historically fluctuated between 25 and 33. Your buying and selling (or spending) is a continuous process, not a single point in time. So, don&rsquo;t worry too much about currency issues; it&rsquo;s not within our consideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 5: There&rsquo;s a U.S. law (the student mentioned &ldquo;Law 899,&rdquo; possibly referring to FATCA or another tax law for foreigners), will it affect us Taiwanese investors?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: That (usually referring to FATCA, etc.) has little to do with Taiwanese people, so don&rsquo;t worry. It mainly targets countries with unequal tax treaties or reciprocal relationships with the U.S., like some G7 countries in Europe (Germany, France, UK, etc.).</li>

<li>Sharing: Thanks for your previous advice on my work issue; my mindset at work has improved a lot. I recall reading the book &ldquo;I Might Be Wrong&rdquo; (the author is Swedish) and noted down two points: 1. Secular success doesn&rsquo;t necessarily bring happiness. 2. Focusing on your breath can train your brain. I didn&rsquo;t quite understand it back then.</li>
<li>Question 1: With your rich experience and having reached your current level, what do you think ultimate happiness is? Also, there are many methods for practicing breathing now (like in yoga); do you have any specific experience with learning to breathe?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ul>
<li><strong>Breathing</strong>: It&rsquo;s very simple, just &ldquo;observe your breath&rdquo; (观呼吸). Notice your own inhales and exhales, know that you are breathing. This is observing the breath. Doing so will naturally clear your mind, eliminate distracting thoughts, and enter a state of &ldquo;presence,&rdquo; a relaxed state focused on the now. We often forget we are breathing during the day, which means we are in a tense state.</li>
<li><strong>Happiness</strong>: Happiness is not determined by secular success or external evaluation. The value of a stock has nothing to do with me. The only thing to focus on is yourself. True happiness comes from within. Practice methods: 1. Observe your breath. 2. Practice introspection (similar to meditation or Christian prayer), empty your mind. 3. Relax your entire body (from head to toe), you can lie down, sit in a chair, or sit cross-legged. 4. Enter a hypnotic state (possible after long practice). 5. In the hypnotic state, give yourself positive affirmations (Re-programming), for example, tell yourself &ldquo;I am happy, I am happy, I am happy,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am wealthy, I am wealthy, I am wealthy,&rdquo; &ldquo;All the money in the world is mine, all the money in the world is mine, all the money in the world is mine,&rdquo; &ldquo;All the market&rsquo;s money is mine,&rdquo; &ldquo;My stocks will always go up, up, up, up, only up and never down.&rdquo; Curve your lips upwards, practice smiling. Happiness needs practice. This is the basic skill of hypnotherapy. I recommend the &ldquo;Rachel&rsquo;s Hypnosis Channel&rdquo; on YouTube, which has many guided sessions for different needs (like improving sleep, increasing wealth, relaxation).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: I previously had some money in Firstrade (about 4 million TWD, 5-6% of my total assets). Recently, I&rsquo;ve heard some concerns about overseas brokerages and plan to wire this money back to Taiwan. My current asset allocation is 433. After this money comes back, should I directly convert it to TWD and buy 00670L (Taiwan&rsquo;s Nasdaq leveraged ETF), or should I use this &ldquo;small amount of money&rdquo; to invest in QLD (since the amount is not large, it won&rsquo;t exceed the 7.5 million TWD tax exemption for overseas income by much)? I want to slightly adjust my overall allocation from 433 to 424.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: As long as your total cash reserve remains above 30%, the market value of your leveraged fund does not exceed your non-leveraged fund or your cash position, and the overall Beta of your portfolio does not exceed 1.0, you can proceed as you wish.</li>

<li>Sharing: I always wanted to be a &ldquo;big shot&rdquo; (senior manager), so I left a large company for a VP role at a small Singaporean firm. My salary doubled, but my workload also doubled. I was basically working 7 days a week, 18 hours a day, with no personal time, not even on Sundays or evenings. What was worse, in my third or fourth week, during a meeting with the company&rsquo;s CTO, he was extremely rude (saying things like &ldquo;a one-year-old child could have made your presentation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;what did I hire you for?&rdquo;). I was very upset and felt verbally abused. Then I remembered your words and realized it wasn&rsquo;t worth it. I contacted my former boss at the big company (who said, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say you were going on leave?&rdquo;), and he welcomed me back. I quickly resigned and returned to my old company. Although I&rsquo;m not a &ldquo;big shot,&rdquo; I feel it was the right decision. That one month at the small company was miserable; there was no happiness. It seems more money can&rsquo;t buy happiness.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Brian, you did the absolutely right thing! Cutting your losses in time and leaving an unsuitable environment is crucial. Just as we shouldn&rsquo;t buy or sell based on stock price fluctuations, we shouldn&rsquo;t choose or leave a job solely based on salary. Happiness is priceless, &ldquo;worth a thousand pieces of gold,&rdquo; and far more important than a high salary. When considering a job, the first question to ask is &ldquo;Am I happy?&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re not, you should leave. Happiness is a human right. You shouldn&rsquo;t accept anything that makes you unhappy. First, remove external sources of unhappiness, then cultivate inner happiness. Young people should try to work for large companies. They have more resources, better systems, and you can learn more (learn systems, management, learn in a big ocean), and the career paths are broader. If you encounter a bad manager or department in a large company, consider an internal transfer (the manager might be transferred, but a good company will remain), rather than resigning hastily. I myself proactively sought an opportunity to be transferred from Acer Taiwan to the US.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: I am an old student who started following you during the market low in 2002, and you gave me a lot of confidence back then. Recently, there&rsquo;s a trend in our group to share that if you use a large amount of cash from your pledged loan, you should prepare twice the borrowed amount in cash as a buffer. To meet this requirement, I sold some of my QLD to supplement my cash, which brought my Beta down very low. Now, I have a new sum of money coming in. Should I use it to pay back part of the loan, or to buy back the QLD I sold? Cheng Feng&rsquo;s advice was that if you use a large sum of money, you need to adjust the entire portfolio proportionally, including the non-leveraged fund (QQQ). Does this conflict with your frequent advice to &ldquo;never sell the core fund&rdquo;? Also, I think Kate said that new funds coming in shouldn&rsquo;t be used to return to a fixed ratio allocation? I&rsquo;m very confused and feel like I haven&rsquo;t grasped the core idea after following you for so long.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Cheng Feng&rsquo;s understanding is correct. When you &ldquo;borrow and spend&rdquo; a large amount of cash from your pledged account (e.g., 10% or more of your total assets, like borrowing 1 million from a 10 million total asset base), this is a special situation that requires a &ldquo;re-navigation&rdquo; or &ldquo;re-positioning&rdquo; of your entire asset allocation.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example and Adjustment Steps</strong>: Let&rsquo;s say you originally had 10 million in assets with a 433 allocation: 4 million in QQQ, 3 million in QLD, and 3 million in cash. Now, you need to borrow and spend 1 million for an emergency.
<ol>
<li>For this 1 million loan, you need to set aside an additional 2 million in cash as a risk buffer (because you borrowed 1 million, you prepare 2 million in cash).</li>
<li>So, out of your 10 million total assets, 2 million in cash is specifically designated to cover this loan risk. The remaining 8 million (10 million - 2 million) is then allocated according to your target allocation (e.g., 433, or adjusted to a more conservative Beta of 0.8, which corresponds to a certain proportion). Specifically, a 433 allocation for 8 million would be: 3.2M QQQ, 2.4M QLD, 2.4M operational cash. Add the 2M risk buffer, and your total cash is 4.4M. In this case, the leveraged fund is 2.4M, which is 24% of the 10M total assets, contributing a Beta of 0.48; the non-leveraged fund is 3.2M, contributing a Beta of 0.32. The total Beta is 0.8.</li>
<li>In this situation, selling a portion of your existing QQQ and QLD proportionally and combining it with your existing cash to create the 2 million risk buffer and the cash needed for the new allocation is a reasonable &ldquo;asset structure adjustment.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not considered a &ldquo;sale that violates the never-sell principle.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>New Capital Injection</strong>: When you have new funds coming in (like the new capital you mentioned), you can use them to restore your QLD position or to supplement the relevant parts of your &ldquo;re-navigated&rdquo; target allocation (which might be Beta 0.8). Restoring QLD to bring the Beta back to 0.8 is fine; it doesn&rsquo;t have to go back to 1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Kate&rsquo;s Viewpoint</strong>: What Kate said about &ldquo;new funds not being used to return to a fixed ratio&rdquo; usually refers to routine, small-scale additions of capital. In that case, you don&rsquo;t need to strictly follow the initial 433 ratio; you can flexibly add to the part you feel needs strengthening the most (e.g., add to cash if it&rsquo;s low, or add to the leveraged position if you want to increase it). This is a different scenario from the &ldquo;re-allocation&rdquo; after a &ldquo;large withdrawal and spending&rdquo; that you described. When a plane is on autopilot, small adjustments are fine. But if the number of passengers changes significantly or the destination changes, you need to re-plan the route and fuel.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Under normal autopilot (small fund inflows/outflows or rebalancing due to market fluctuations), the core asset is not easily touched. But when a major event like a large withdrawal for spending occurs, changing the overall risk structure, you need to re-evaluate and adjust the entire allocation. Following for a long time doesn&rsquo;t guarantee you&rsquo;ve learned well; the key is to learn the core principles.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: I want to share some risk points about the direct selling (or MLM) industry, as I heard a user mention wanting to return to Taiwan to do direct selling to change their situation.
<ol>
<li><strong>High entry fees</strong>: Be wary of these.</li>
<li><strong>No substantial product or service</strong>: Or the price of the product/service is severely disconnected from its market value (e.g., selling wine from Maotai Town at an exorbitant price; something worth a few hundred sold for thousands).</li>
<li><strong>Focus on recruiting downlines, ignoring consumer experience</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Different purchase prices for agents at different levels</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Promises of quick riches through IPOs, dividends, or stock options</strong>: Especially with newly established companies that lure you into buying a lot of inventory at once.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Advice for Choosing Direct Selling</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Mainland China</strong>: Look for companies with a direct selling license issued by the Ministry of Commerce (a total of 88), which are relatively legitimate. There are now many new retail, social e-commerce, and micro-business models whose underlying logic may be similar.</li>
<li><strong>US or other regions</strong>: Choose companies that have been established for over 10 years, preferably publicly listed ones (financial reports are public and transparent, and can be analyzed). Only about 10% of new companies survive for three to five years; most fail within five years.</li>
<li><strong>Long-termism</strong>: Even with legitimate direct selling, it requires long-term commitment (at least 5 years). Don&rsquo;t expect to get rich quick. If it feels like a &ldquo;great opportunity&rdquo; for rapid change, there&rsquo;s a high risk of being scammed.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of &ldquo;Direct Selling + Insurance&rdquo; models</strong>: In the US, services can also be sold via direct selling. The combination of direct selling and insurance requires special caution, as it can be highly deceptive, seeming to offer both income and security. Chinese direct selling law requires physical products and a factory.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: JASON&rsquo;s reminder is excellent; scams are everywhere. Everyone should be wary of messages that demand urgent action (e.g., &ldquo;Your payment of $698 has been successful, please call this number if you have questions&rdquo;), or else your account will be frozen, your package will be lost, or that urge you to pay first. You can use AI tools like ChatGPT to make a preliminary judgment on the authenticity of an email (I once used ChatGPT to verify a DMV email). Remember, nothing is that urgent. Take a deep breath, think calmly, and don&rsquo;t part with your money easily. When people are eager to do something (like get rich), they are more likely to be scammed. I myself had an experience in high school with a summer job scam that cost me 300 TWD; I paid the fee and the person disappeared.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The market is truly unrelated to international situations, financial reports, or the economy. Whether interest rates are cut or not doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s all fine, it has nothing to do with us. It all has nothing to do with me.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This viewpoint, woven throughout the session, emphasizes the transcendent mindset an investor should have, focusing on their own investment discipline and not being distracted by external noise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The market will definitely go up, the market will definitely reach new highs. Investing requires patience, and wealth is worth the trouble.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This articulates a firm belief in the long-term trend of the market and the character required for successful investing—patience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I might be wrong. I might be wrong. I might be wrong.
&ndash; Teacher James (quoting from the book &ldquo;I Might Be Wrong&rdquo;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When facing disagreements or strong emotions, engaging in self-reflection first can help resolve conflicts and enhance cognition and inner peace.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hold stocks in your hand, but not their prices in your heart. You only need to spend five minutes a year on it.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This describes the ideal state of investing: holding quality assets without being disturbed by short-term price fluctuations, emphasizing the simplicity and passive nature of investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boredom is the highest state of investing. If you feel it&rsquo;s exciting, then you&rsquo;re speculating, you&rsquo;re gambling.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reveals the true nature of long-term value investing, drawing a clear line between it and the thrill-seeking behavior of speculation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can handle something, face it and get it done. If you can&rsquo;t handle it, then forget about it, as it&rsquo;s not within your capability.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This offers a philosophical attitude for dealing with various problems in life and investing, reducing unnecessary worries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely do not sell your QQQ, sell your 00662, during a downturn. You can choose not to buy, but you must never sell.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This emphasizes that one should not panic-sell core quality assets during a market correction, a common mistake among investors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t leave (your current job) because your salary is low, and don&rsquo;t jump to another just because its salary is high.
&ndash; Teacher James (commenting on Brian&rsquo;s sharing)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This highlights that in career choices, personal happiness and the growth environment are more important than short-term salary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your cash must be able to last you 15 years (during a market downturn). This is a critical key.
&ndash; Teacher James (on asset allocation for retirees)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This points out the importance of having cash reserves in retirement planning that can cover a long bear market (which could last up to 15 years before the market doubles).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happiness is a human right. Therefore, you shouldn&rsquo;t accept anything that makes you unhappy.
&ndash; Teacher James (commenting on Brian&rsquo;s sharing)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This encourages people to prioritize inner happiness and harmony in their work and life, and to have the courage to change unhappy situations.</p>

<p>In this sharing session, Teacher James once again reinforced the core philosophy of long-term investing: maintain optimism, adhere to discipline, and filter out market noise with the wisdom of &ldquo;it has nothing to do with me.&rdquo; By recommending &ldquo;I Might Be Wrong&rdquo; and &ldquo;Life is Worthwhile,&rdquo; he guided students to cultivate their inner selves, focus on breathing and relaxation, and achieve harmony in both investing and life. In terms of asset allocation, the teacher detailed cash management strategies for different life stages, especially the importance of having 15 years of living expenses for retirees to safely navigate market cycles, and gave clear guidance on pledging, leverage, and Beta control. The Q&amp;A session delved into specific cases, addressing students&rsquo; confusion in practical operations, such as portfolio adjustments after large cash withdrawals, tax considerations for overseas investments, the wisdom of career choices, and preventing financial scams like direct selling. The teacher encouraged students to work and live in a relaxed, stress-free state, to simplify investing, and ultimately achieve financial freedom and life happiness. He emphasized investing in index funds like QQQ/00662 and avoiding annuities and unnecessary insurance.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stablecoins and Short-Term Treasuries</strong>: A student asked if the issuance of stablecoins would increase demand for short-term treasuries and lower their interest rates. Teacher James believes short-term treasury rates are tied to the central bank&rsquo;s rates and won&rsquo;t fall significantly because of this. Short-term treasuries are similar to money market funds with low volatility. The central bank&rsquo;s rate is the benchmark; no one would buy a bond with a lower rate.</li>
<li><strong>The Trap of Long-Term Bonds</strong>: Long-term bond interest is linked to inflation expectations for many years to come, and the interest is fixed.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: For a 30-year Treasury bond with a 5% coupon rate, if inflation is 3%, the real annualized rate of return (Real IRR) is only 1.94%. In contrast, if short-term rates are 4%, it is far superior to the real return of long-term bonds. The $5 in interest you receive after 30 years will have long been devalued.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: It is not recommended for individual investors to buy long-term government bonds. Issuing long-term bonds is advantageous for the U.S. Treasury because the long-term interest is close to zero for the issuer (after considering inflation). Even if the central bank&rsquo;s rate is below 2%, buying long-term bonds is not necessarily a good deal. The Treasury has its own issuance plan and won&rsquo;t easily change it due to shifts in the central bank&rsquo;s rates. The idea of issuing 100-year bonds is impractical and tantamount to default.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Awareness</strong>: The first priority in investing is risk control; the world is full of uncertainties (like the conflict in Israel).</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Asset Allocation</strong>: Good asset allocation is a &ldquo;master strategy&rdquo; (奇门遁甲), a powerful &ldquo;Army, Navy, and Air Force&rdquo; deployment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash</strong>: The &ldquo;food and air&rdquo; of asset allocation, the most important part. Sufficient cash prevents market panic.</li>
<li><strong>Index Fund</strong>: The &ldquo;aircraft carrier&rdquo; of asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraged Fund</strong>: Like the &ldquo;missile force.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging</strong>: The &ldquo;Transformer&rdquo; of asset allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Courage to Sell a House for Investment</strong>: Selling your primary residence to rent and investing the funds in an index is an excellent financial strategy, but it requires a strong mind and the courage to face social judgment (e.g., fear of being told you&rsquo;re &ldquo;not doing well&rdquo;). In reality, this is a sign of &ldquo;doing exceptionally well.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Difficulty of Educating Family and Friends</strong>: Family and friends would rather trust the annuities and savings insurance (1% return) recommended by bank advisors than accept advice about index funds (10% long-term return), even when presented with spreadsheets. The main reason is the fear of &ldquo;what if it drops?&rdquo;
<ul>
<li><strong>Counter-strategy</strong>: First, become a &ldquo;big tree&rdquo; yourself and influence them with your own success. Your words carry little weight when you&rsquo;re insignificant; &ldquo;familiarity breeds contempt&rdquo; (近庙欺神). It&rsquo;s hard to distinguish &ldquo;saints&rdquo; from &ldquo;demons&rdquo; in society.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive Roots of the Wealth Gap</strong>: Poverty is often caused by a lack of awareness, not systemic issues. CLEC aims to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; this &ldquo;disease of poverty,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s very difficult; even family members may not accept it. Some people can&rsquo;t accept good medicine and instead buy things like long-term bonds.</li>
<li><strong>The Challenges of Individual Stock Investing</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: NVIDIA&rsquo;s stock price fluctuates wildly. It was once sold off due to poor sales and excess inventory, then soared because of AI. It&rsquo;s difficult for individual investors to grasp; even if you bought it, you might not have held on for the entire ride.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Individual stocks are volatile, information is asymmetric, and they can suddenly be cut in half or go to zero. ETFs provide a more stable way to share in market growth. It&rsquo;s also very hard to stick with a portfolio of mixed-quality individual stocks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Dangers of Short-Term Trading</strong>: Short-term trading is like &ldquo;gambling + drug addiction.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s addictive and leads not only to financial loss but also the loss of family, health, and self, potentially ruining one&rsquo;s entire life. There&rsquo;s no need to become a &ldquo;boy wonder trader.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Profit Motives of Banks and Insurance Companies</strong>: Criticizes post offices and banks for persuading depositors (especially the elderly) to buy annuity insurance, structured notes, and similar products. This is a failure of financial regulators.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Issues</strong>: Believes financial regulators should ensure the separation of savings, insurance, wealth management, and lending to avoid conflicts of interest. American commercial banks (like BofA) don&rsquo;t proactively sell insurance. Taiwan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Financial Holding Company&rdquo; model is described as an &ldquo;all-encompassing, one-stop-shop scam.&rdquo; Charles Schwab only mentions loan options when a client has a large funding need.</li>
<li><strong>The Goal of the Insurance Industry</strong>: To convert large amounts of fixed deposits into insurance policies, which is the main objective of the insurance industry, given the huge amount of fixed deposits in Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>The Risk of Mortgaging Property to Buy Insurance</strong>: There have been cases where the property mortgage remains, but the insurance policy&rsquo;s value drops to zero, leaving people homeless. These institutions &ldquo;will go as far as making people homeless.&rdquo;</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>On Publishing a Book/Media Exposure</strong>: Teacher James frankly states that if he were to publicly promote his ideas like &ldquo;investing with loans&rdquo; and &ldquo;not buying a house,&rdquo; he could violate financial regulations (practicing without a license), offend powerful interest groups (real estate, insurance, finance), and even face cyberbullying and political pressure (being labeled &ldquo;pro-Taiwan independence&rdquo; or &ldquo;pro-CCP&rdquo;). He could be &ldquo;torn to shreds&rdquo; or even &ldquo;end up in jail.&rdquo; If he doesn&rsquo;t discuss many of these topics, the teaching loses its meaning. The very people you help might turn around and curse you.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance</strong>: An insurance policy with a 1.06% annual return is acceptable if it includes protection, but it&rsquo;s generally not recommended.</li>
<li><strong>Caring for Parents</strong>: Re-emphasizes the loneliness and health risks of elderly people living alone (not taking medicine on time, not measuring blood sugar/pressure, leading to complications like worsening COPD, minor strokes, brain atrophy, mental disorders). Advises children to pay attention and provide companionship early. Even if parents seem self-sufficient, consider arranging for a caregiver early to prevent accidents and ensure a regular routine (medication, diet, avoiding falls). Shares his regret of not returning to Taiwan in time to accompany his mother, who, despite having other children in Taiwan, was not adequately cared for while living alone. Emphasizes that parents&rsquo; health is the children&rsquo;s happiness.</li>
<li><strong>A Partner&rsquo;s Investment Philosophy</strong>: Accept individual differences. Due to different upbringings and personal experiences (like living through the dot-com and 2008 bubbles), security levels and cognitions vary. Lead by example and influence them gradually with long-term results; don&rsquo;t force it. It&rsquo;s normal for them not to listen to you, just as you may not listen to them.</li>
<li><strong>00662 (Taiwan ETF) Currency Impact</strong>: Short-term currency fluctuations are normal. For instance, when the Taiwan dollar depreciated in the previous two years, 00662 outperformed QQQ. In the long run, currency effects tend to cancel each other out.</li>
<li><strong>Credit Loans vs. Stock Pledges</strong>: Credit loans are relatively independent and safe. Stock pledges are high-risk; a sharp market downturn could trigger a margin call, making it like a &ldquo;loan shark&rdquo; — you have to pay back when they demand it, or you&rsquo;re &ldquo;shot dead with one bullet.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Brokerage Firms Raising Pledge Rates and Risks</strong>: Brokerages like Capital Securities in Taiwan might raise interest rates after a client has borrowed, or even restrict withdrawals (due to limited funding pools), &ldquo;luring you into a trap.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s advisable to prioritize more stable brokerages like Yuanta Securities.</li>
<li><strong>Apply for Credit Loans Early</strong>: Bank credit policies can change. When you qualify (e.g., with an interest rate below 2%), you should apply early. Seize the opportunity when a bank proactively offers you a loan.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging in Hong Kong</strong>: HSBC is a good choice, especially for VIP clients with large capital (e.g., over 1 million HKD). HSBC&rsquo;s pledge interest rates are currently low. Friends from Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, etc., who successfully open an account and get a pledge loan from HSBC are welcome to share their experiences.</li>
<li><strong>QQQ Compounding</strong>: The annualized rate of return (CAGR), according to Teacher James&rsquo;s research, is around 18% (including dividend reinvestment).</li>
<li><strong>Repayment of Investment Mortgage</strong>: Typically, it&rsquo;s a lump-sum repayment at maturity (10-15 years). By then, you can sell some stocks or use another pledged loan to repay it. You need more than 15 years to ensure profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Compound Frequency</strong>: Refers to capital gains and dividend reinvestment.</li>
<li><strong>Philosophy of Helping Others</strong>: There are different levels of helping others. The lowest is for others (hoping for their well-being). The next is for oneself (deriving happiness or meaning from it). The highest is selflessness (helping is a natural act, regardless of for whom, or whether it brings happiness, like the Buddha or Jesus; it&rsquo;s natural ethics). Using helping others to add meaning and happiness to one&rsquo;s own life is actually &ldquo;not right.&rdquo; The highest state is &ldquo;like water flowing without a trace&rdquo; (传过水无痕).</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: An elderly friend, who was once very influential in the market, agrees with Teacher James&rsquo;s index investing philosophy. This elder confessed that his past outsized returns were due to information asymmetry and his influence (manipulating small-cap stocks), which is not replicable for ordinary investors. He believes it&rsquo;s not easy for ordinary people to make money in the market, and index investing is the most correct path.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Index investing not only makes you money but also gives you a &ldquo;life&rdquo; (improves quality of life). Even if you make money from short-term trading, you might lose your life due to constant anxiety (e.g., being unable to take a 15-day vacation with peace of mind).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sharing (Follow-up)</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Reflecting on her family life, she emphasizes love and companionship for her parents to avoid regrets. She sees Teacher James&rsquo;s actions as &ldquo;dedication&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;charity&rdquo; with a sense of superiority and feels for the misunderstandings he might face.</li>
<li>Shares her future plans: to establish a women&rsquo;s financial academy (focusing on female financial awareness, as Chinese women are relatively disadvantaged, and financial independence provides more confidence), volunteer in hospice care (to learn about &ldquo;fasting until death&rdquo; and euthanasia), travel, read, and set up scholarships, reflecting a desire for &ldquo;altruism&rdquo; (influenced by Kazuo Inamori&rsquo;s philosophy of &ldquo;altruism&rdquo;).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Commends Kacy&rsquo;s practice of accompanying her parents. Shares the joy of his own father, in his 90s, still planning a trip to Korea. Advises that for elderly parents, even if they appear healthy, one should consider arranging for a caregiver early to prevent accidents and ensure a regular routine (medication, diet). Parents&rsquo; health is the children&rsquo;s happiness. If parents have medical needs, like follow-up visits every three months or low-dose lung cancer screenings, they should be supported.</li>
<li>Greatly admires Kacy&rsquo;s &ldquo;altruistic&rdquo; plans, believing that from a women&rsquo;s financial academy to educating disadvantaged groups, it&rsquo;s all very meaningful. It&rsquo;s right to start planning now.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: His mother noticed his mood has become calmer and happier recently. He explained it&rsquo;s because through investing (practicing the teacher&rsquo;s teachings), he has found meaning in life and is confident about his future wealth, no longer worrying about finances. This has led to an internal change from external influences.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Shares his own longing and regrets regarding his mother, how in his youth he failed to fully grasp the loneliness and hardship of an elderly person living alone (e.g., his mother falling while going to the doctor alone, and his own failure to return to Taiwan to be with her). Reminds everyone to care for their parents, especially those living alone, after achieving financial freedom early, to avoid life&rsquo;s regrets. Advises young people to learn from wise elders (like Warren Buffett) to avoid many pitfalls and find a &ldquo;mental coach.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Following the teacher&rsquo;s guidance, he used an investment mortgage to invest in 00662. After using a portion of the funds from high-dividend ETFs to pay the monthly interest, there&rsquo;s still a surplus each month. Should he invest this in 00865 (short-term bond/cash-like ETF) or continue buying fractional shares of 00662?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Continue buying 00662. The emergency fund (00865) only needs to be built up to a certain level (e.g., 2-3 years of living expenses for someone employed). Any excess funds should be invested in growth assets.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: Recalls entering the market in 2018, with emotions fluctuating with the market, having once lost 50%. A wise friend enlightened her (&ldquo;Save money when you&rsquo;re making it, and just wait it out when it&rsquo;s down&rdquo;), teaching her to remain calm through ups and downs and become numb to the market. Mentions how wealthy people view money (a piece of clothing costs 500-600k; money is like trash to them). Grateful for the teacher&rsquo;s guidance that has &ldquo;filled her head.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: Has come to understand the teacher&rsquo;s mindset that &ldquo;all sharing is for self-fulfillment, not for rewards.&rdquo; When sharing investment ideas with others, she encounters different reactions: some (who have worked for 20-30 years and are set in their ways) cling to old concepts, while others, despite living in hardship (a single mother working two jobs), are willing to listen. Through sharing, she has also gained a sense of value by giving back the knowledge she has learned.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: (Regarding Sharing 2) Helping others can bring happiness, but the highest state is to be &ldquo;unaffected by helping,&rdquo; meaning helping others is a natural act, not for happiness, not for self. The lowest level is &ldquo;for others,&rdquo; i.e., for their benefit; the second level is &ldquo;for oneself,&rdquo; i.e., achieving self-actualization through helping (the teacher admits his own teaching is to find value in retirement); the highest is &ldquo;selflessness,&rdquo; where even the thought of &ldquo;for myself&rdquo; is gone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: After sharing investment concepts with friends, how can she determine if they truly understand? Are there any questions to ask to test them? (Friends listen and think it&rsquo;s logical but can&rsquo;t articulate it themselves.)
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: It&rsquo;s hard to judge with simple questions. True understanding is reflected in action (like opening an account to invest). A more effective way is like how Frank guided him back in the day (meeting for dinner every week, hand-holding him through opening an account, starting with a $200 Mutual Fund), guiding them step-by-step to open an account, make their first investment, and follow up continuously. This is a process of &ldquo;sowing seeds&rdquo;; whether and when they sprout is unknown. He himself was &ldquo;led by the hand&rdquo; by Frank to get started. Now, he is willing to be such a guide, with the Bodhisattva spirit of &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t descend into hell, who will?&rdquo;</li>

<li><strong>Individual Differences</strong>: The same seeds planted result in different flowers, just as people receive information differently.

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Came into contact with CLEC in 2024 through a friend (who had mentioned it 5 years ago, but she was indifferent at the time). In her 50s, she has been interested in investing since graduating from college and has been exploring on her own for years. She was deeply moved after listening to the lectures and has invested a lot of time in studying (finished the 2021-2022 courses and is now re-listening). She shared it with a hundred people, and only two took action, but she still feels gratified.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Regarding the choice between a credit loan and a stock pledge in Taiwan. She leans towards using the stock pledge first (2.56% interest, no principal repayment, only interest), because of its convenience. She thinks she can use a credit loan (already approved for a 3 million TWD limit, but requires installment repayments) as a backup if the stock market crashes. She believes her job is stable (banks are always begging her to take out loans), so she&rsquo;s not afraid of unemployment and can access the credit loan anytime.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: (In a firm tone, repeatedly emphasizing) <strong>Absolutely do not do this!</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: Money borrowed from a stock pledge <strong>must not be reinvested in the stock market</strong>. It can only be used for living expenses or to repay other loans. This is &ldquo;the first thing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Huge Risk</strong>: When the market crashes, banks may tighten credit (&ldquo;take away the umbrella in the rain&rdquo;), and you might not be able to borrow money then. If you lose your job at the same time, it&rsquo;s even more impossible. A credit loan is not something you can just &ldquo;hold there&rdquo; forever.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy All Troops (韩信点兵)</strong>: All available &ldquo;forces&rdquo; (including the credit loan) should be deployed to the &ldquo;battlefield&rdquo; (investment) as early as possible.</li>
<li><strong>The Correct Approach</strong>: You should first take out the credit loan (e.g., 3 million TWD) and invest it in the market. The monthly loan repayments can be paid using funds from a low-interest stock pledge. This way, the principal continues to work in the market, and your personal salary can also be invested. Don&rsquo;t take a huge risk just because you&rsquo;re &ldquo;too lazy to repay the principal&rdquo; or tempted by the short-term convenience of a pledge.</li>
<li><strong>Safety of Credit Loans</strong>: A credit loan is a relatively safe form of leverage, not directly linked to market fluctuations, and you won&rsquo;t get a margin call. With a stock pledge, even if you only borrow 10% (e.g., pledging 1 million from a 10 million asset portfolio—the teacher thinks 10% is already a huge risk, let alone the 2-3 million she wants to borrow), you could face risks in an extreme market downturn.</li>
<li><strong>Brokerage Risk</strong>: Some brokerages in Taiwan (like Capital Securities) may change their pledge interest rates, and their limited funding pools might prevent you from withdrawing funds as needed.
(Kacy and other students also chimed in, emphasizing the risk of banks &ldquo;taking away the umbrella in the rain&rdquo; and the fundamental difference between credit loans and pledges, and that pledged money cannot be used to buy more stocks).</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Market fluctuations have nothing to do with me, international affairs have nothing to do with me, market analysis has nothing to do with me, financial statements have nothing to do with us, and the economic situation doesn&rsquo;t matter at all. Don&rsquo;t pay attention to it. The more you pay attention, the more mistakes you&rsquo;ll make.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Background: Student IM sharing her transformation from anxiously watching the market to maintaining a calm composure towards market fluctuations.</p>

<p>In this session, Teacher James systematically re-emphasized his core investment philosophy: consistently buy and hold the Nasdaq 100 index fund, fearless of short-term market volatility. He focused on analyzing the extreme importance of risk control, viewing reasonable asset allocation (especially an adequate cash reserve) as the cornerstone of investment success. Through specific examples, the teacher revealed the investment value trap of long-term bonds and severely criticized certain misleading and detrimental practices in the financial industry, especially warning investors against low-return products like annuities and savings insurance. At the same time, he pointed out the huge uncertainty of individual stock investing and the destructive nature of short-term trading. During the Q&amp;A session, students actively shared their insights and confusions from their investment practices, family communication, and personal growth. Teacher James not only provided specific investment advice (such as the correct use and risk perception of credit loans versus stock pledges) but also guided students from a life philosophy perspective to reflect on the meaning of wealth, work, family, and personal value, encouraging everyone on the path to financial freedom to continuously enhance their cognition, maintain a positive mindset, pay attention to family and social responsibilities, and ultimately give back to society.</p>

      <description>In this session, Mr. James emphasizes the core philosophy of long-term investing, which is to ignore short-term market fluctuations and focus on quality assets (like the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund). He delves into strategies for personal wealth accumulation within the capitalist system, including correctly understanding risk, rationally using leverage (advising conservatism for most), and balancing wealth inheritance with life&amp;#39;s meaning. The core message is that through the right investment mindset and methods, ordinary people can achieve financial freedom and live a fulfilling life, rather than merely chasing money.</description>

<p>Mr. James&rsquo;s core viewpoints in this session revolve around <strong>long-term investing, ignoring market noise, understanding the essence of capitalism, and balancing wealth with life</strong>. He emphasizes that investors should focus on quality passive ETFs like the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQQ) and possess the patience and optimism for long-term holding. Simultaneously, he deeply analyzes the impact of the capitalist system on different social classes, how to utilize capital markets to achieve personal and family financial freedom, and explores profound topics such as the relationship between wealth accumulation and life happiness, family relationships, children&rsquo;s education, elderly care for parents, and wealth inheritance.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No need to pay attention to market signals</strong>: Market disturbances (like tariffs, wars) are irrelevant to long-term investing; the market will eventually rise, and approaching or even setting new highs is normal. Investors need not worry about short-term signals.
<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> The current market is full of turmoil, yet it&rsquo;s close to setting new highs, proving that short-term signals are inconsequential.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Learn from history, understand the present</strong>: The century-long history of the U.S. stock market shows that while it doesn&rsquo;t repeat, it rhymes astonishingly. Understanding history helps solidify long-term investment beliefs. Mr. James shares insights based on his 40 years of market experience and understanding of 200 years of U.S. market history.</li>
<li><strong>Optimism and patience</strong>: Investors should always be extremely optimistic and unaffected by external pessimism and fear-mongering. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t listen or look, it doesn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo; Wealth is worth waiting for; investing requires patience.</li>
<li><strong>Technical analysis is ineffective</strong>: Those who believe technical analysis is effective haven&rsquo;t truly grasped investing. Market fluctuations can sometimes be like &ldquo;madness&rdquo;; no need to dance to its tune.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQQ)</strong>: This is currently the fastest-growing passive ETF globally, suitable for young investors to accelerate asset appreciation. Mr. James provides links to resources for investing in Nasdaq 100 Index Funds worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Learning resources</strong>: Recommends watching a series of videos (e.g., 00451 &ldquo;Value Investing Lecture&rdquo; as a compulsory course for newcomers, as well as 398, 399, 400, etc.), learning them in conjunction with the market conditions at the time to achieve a solid grasp.</li>
<li><strong>Getting started for young professionals/small investors</strong>: It&rsquo;s advised to set aside an emergency fund for six months to a year before starting to invest in QQQ or 00662 (a Taiwanese ETF tracking Nasdaq 100). Buy whenever you have money, don&rsquo;t try to time the market, buy at market price.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systemic traps of capitalism</strong>: Mr. James quotes and agrees with a YouTuber&rsquo;s perspective that capitalism is designed to favor the rich, reflected in:
<ul>
<li><strong>Tax mechanisms</strong>: Investment income (e.g., U.S. Long-term Capital Gains, tax-free for singles up to $40k/couples up to $80k, with rates of 15%-20% above that) is taxed at much lower rates than labor income (up to 37%), benefiting long-term investors. Taiwan doesn&rsquo;t even have capital gains tax.</li>
<li><strong>Triple risks for the middle class</strong>: Job, company stock, and property near the company are highly intertwined. If the company has problems, one might lose their job, stock value, and property (or face mortgage pressure) simultaneously. Advice: Sell company stock promptly and reinvest in QQQ; buy a house only after achieving financial freedom (&ldquo;buying a house should be like buying slippers&rdquo;).</li>
<li><strong>Differences in borrowing</strong>: The rich borrow money to get richer (investment), while the middle class borrows money to become poorer (consumption).</li>
<li><strong>Differences in income growth</strong>: Income from physical labor struggles to keep pace with inflation and asset appreciation.</li>
<li><strong>Differences in offspring development</strong>: Middle-class children rely on &ldquo;involution&rdquo; (cram schools, prestigious universities, spending hundreds of thousands to get into private schools), while wealthy children can pursue their interests and grow up happily.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of financial bubbles</strong>: The middle class is forced to sell assets at low prices when bubbles burst because they can&rsquo;t hold on, while the rich have the money and opportunity to buy the dip.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Utilizing capitalism</strong>: Despite its pitfalls, the capital market is an important way for ordinary people to bridge the wealth gap and share the dividends of social progress.
<ul>
<li><strong>At the national level</strong>: If citizens all become capitalists, holding shares in globally competitive companies (like TSMC, Apple), they can enjoy the benefits of globalization while &ldquo;transferring&rdquo; negative externalities of production (like pollution). Citizens should ponder: Is it better to be proud of owning a factory, or proud of owning shares in that factory?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Borrow 100 Million&rdquo; thought experiment</strong>: If someone were willing to lend you 100 million (any currency) at 5% interest, to be repaid in 40 years, would you dare to borrow it? Those who dare and know how to use it possess a rich mindset, because this money, through investment, can generate returns far exceeding the interest, potentially allowing for immediate retirement. The key is whether you have the credit or assets to borrow this sum.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration from Trump&rsquo;s proposed &ldquo;Great Child America Act&rdquo;</strong>: Investing $1,000 annually for newborns from a young age cultivates financial literacy and long-term compound interest awareness, reflecting a nation&rsquo;s soft power. This is more meaningful than direct subsidies.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beyond &ldquo;cost&rdquo; thinking</strong>: Falling in love, getting married, and having children should not be calculated as &ldquo;costs.&rdquo; With a long-term wealth perspective (e.g., 1 million becoming 1 billion in 40 years), money is meant to be spent, and family is for sharing love.
<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> If you only think about the immediate 1 million not being enough, you miss the possibility of becoming a billionaire enjoying life in the future. By 60-70, even with money, you might not be able to make up for regrets from youth (like having children).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Die with Zero&rdquo; philosophy</strong>: Life should be fully experienced, rather than dying with a huge fortune, which is the tragedy of &ldquo;having nothing but money.&rdquo; Money should be spent wisely to create beautiful memories.</li>
<li><strong>Financial wisdom for couples</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic security</strong>: The higher-earning spouse should proactively transfer a portion of their funds (e.g., 50k from a 150k salary) to the other&rsquo;s account, giving them financial freedom and security, avoiding the need to &ldquo;report everything&rdquo; or &ldquo;ask for money.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Common goals</strong>: Couples should have aligned financial views, invest together, and not bicker over money (like who does the dishes or takes out the trash). A home needs love.</li>
<li><strong>Improve oneself first</strong>: In a family, first make yourself &ldquo;worthy of being loved.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Becoming the &ldquo;big tree&rdquo; of the family</strong>: Through long-term investment, everyone has the potential (hundreds of thousands becoming hundreds of millions, millions becoming billions) to become the family&rsquo;s economic pillar, providing shelter for loved ones.</li>
<li><strong>Elderly care for parents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Health is the biggest money-saver</strong>: Instead of worrying if pensions are sufficient, care more about parents&rsquo; health, manage their blood pressure and blood sugar, ensure they take medication on time, and have regular check-ups (e.g., for macular degeneration, joints, carotid artery stents). Healthy parents mean a lighter burden for children.</li>
<li><strong>Cost estimation</strong>: If parents are completely dependent, a caregiver plus basic expenses might cost NT$80,000-100,000 per month. Mr. James&rsquo;s mother cost about NT$10 million over 10 years.</li>
<li><strong>Plan early</strong>: When children are 30, parents are around 60. Significant expenses might arise after age 80. Regularly investing NT$1,000-2,000 per month for parents can accumulate a considerable pension fund after 20 years.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplify investing</strong>: Once asset allocation is done, you can set it to &ldquo;autopilot,&rdquo; no need to watch the market daily or analyze asset performance. Spending 5 minutes once a year for rebalancing is sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>Risk awareness</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Market goes to zero&rdquo; test</strong>: Before any investment decision, ask yourself, &ldquo;If this investment goes to zero tomorrow, can I handle it? Even if I can&rsquo;t sell stocks for three years, can I survive?&rdquo; If not, the risk is too high.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity risk</strong>: Some markets or specific situations (like some mainland China ETFs in 2022) may experience situations where you want to sell but cannot.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage risk</strong>: Margin loans (e.g., from a brokerage account) are extremely risky. A market downturn can lead to margin calls or even negative equity (e.g., stocks drop to $800k, but you borrowed $1 million, owing $200k). Personal loans (with stable income, used for investment) are relatively manageable because they are not directly tied to stock market value for forced liquidation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The essence of learning</strong>: It&rsquo;s not just about learning what works, but more importantly, learning that &ldquo;these things are useless&rdquo; (like technical analysis, economic analysis, business cycle indicators). This conclusion is reached after understanding these tools.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Observed some people nearing retirement with no stable income wanting to borrow money to invest. However, their understanding of investment philosophy and risk tolerance might be insufficient. Advised such individuals not to borrow easily; they should first build a solid foundation with their own funds and become mentally strong enough before considering advanced operations.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: Strongly agree. Investors first need to experience market volatility (e.g., a 10-15% correction) with their own funds to confirm they can tolerate it before considering borrowing. For retirees:
<ul>
<li>Personal loans: If there&rsquo;s no stable income for repayment, a market downturn will force selling stocks to repay debt, which is not recommended.</li>
<li>Mortgages: A home equity line of credit (HELOC, interest-only payments, like in the US) might be considered; however, mortgages requiring principal and interest payments are not recommended due to the large amounts involved.</li>
<li>Core principle: For any leveraged investment, consider, &ldquo;If the stock drops to zero, the loan still needs to be repaid. Can I handle it?&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: As a listener for over two years, he gradually shifted personal funds, private equity, trusts, and insurance products into QQQ and domestic Nasdaq ETFs. Due to excessive optimism, he used margin (brokerage account overdraft to buy) from late 2023 to early 2024, almost at 1:1 leverage. He then encountered the &ldquo;tariff war&rdquo; and liquidity issues in the domestic ETF market (e.g., 513100), where some ETFs hit their limit down and couldn&rsquo;t be sold. He was forced to significantly deleverage the next day, wiping out much of the previous year&rsquo;s profits. His father&rsquo;s account, with no leverage and regular investments, hit an all-time high. Profound realization: Don&rsquo;t rush to make money; slow is fast, and safety is more important. Personal cash flow and future income expectations are crucial when using leverage. Also, in panic, he cleared out QLD from his Hong Kong account, missing the subsequent rally. This experience reminded him of the 2015 A-share market crash, also involving margin calls and being unable to sell for three consecutive days.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: Sams&rsquo; experience is very typical. Markets have liquidity risks, and margin risks are enormous, potentially leading to margin calls or even owing the brokerage money. Repeatedly emphasized the importance of the &ldquo;market goes to zero test.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t test human nature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Investing allows one to control their own destiny. He experienced his company being acquired, then another company he co-founded being acquired (sold to Evergrande, which later defaulted, and got entangled in lawsuits), and personally shutting down an underperforming branch (decided to close the Chongqing branch after a three-hour walk with his boss; employees were given N+1 severance the next day). Because he had investments as a backup, he was more composed when facing these changes. Colleagues without investments (like some branch managers) felt lost about their future. Insight: Whether in good times or bad, hold on to good assets.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: All things have unexpected events (companies go bankrupt, properties get damaged). When investing, first think about risk. Jobs and individual stocks carry high risks. QQQ will also drop significantly. Only invest money you won&rsquo;t need for 15-20-30 years. Retirees need to set aside about 15 years of cash for living expenses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: Mr. James once suggested 70% QQQ / 30% cash, and allocating 2% to leveraged funds (like QLD) in down years. He wanted to confirm:
<ol>
<li>Can mainland China and Hong Kong accounts be treated as one, with a synchronized 70/30 allocation?</li>
<li>Since transferring funds out of mainland China is troublesome, should more leveraged funds be allocated in Hong Kong?</li>
<li>If the market falls at year-end, is the 2% allocation to leveraged funds based on 2% of total assets or only 2% of Hong Kong assets?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s reply:
<ol>
<li>For beginners or those sensitive to volatility, 70/30 (QQQ/cash) or even 60/40 is a safe starting point. No need to rush into leveraged funds. Because even if the overall drop isn&rsquo;t large, the violent fluctuations of leveraged funds themselves can cause anxiety (e.g., only focusing on QLD dropping 5%, not seeing that cash doesn&rsquo;t drop).</li>
<li>Beta can start at a lower level (e.g., 0.6-0.8) and gradually increase with experience and asset growth.</li>
<li>Regarding the 2% QLD allocation: It can be calculated based on Hong Kong assets or total assets. However, note that leveraged funds usually cannot be used as collateral for bank loans (e.g., at HSBC). If QLD proportion is too high, it might affect future collateralized financing plans.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Listening to Mr. James&rsquo;s class is like learning life philosophy; investing is a battle against human nature. Experienced the recent market correction (what the teacher called a &ldquo;slap in the face&rdquo; market). Although he wanted to hold on, he was scared and sold half of his holdings, including some individual stocks like Nvidia.</li>
<li>Question: His Roth IRA account is small, and he&rsquo;s nearing retirement. He wants to know if an allocation of 60% QQQ + 10% TQQQ + 30% cash, or 70% QQQ + 20% TQQQ + 10% cash, resulting in an overall Beta of around 0.8, is robust enough while also providing growth.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s reply: A 60/10/30 (QQQ/TQQQ/cash) configuration, with a Beta around 0.8, is very good. Beta will increase as the leveraged portion grows. For those afraid of volatility, an initial Beta of 0.6-0.8 is sufficient.</li>

<li>Sharing: Recently, watching news (Elon Musk leaving the White House after 130 days, under immense pressure, even relying on medication and games to de-stress) and movies (the heavy burden and helplessness of the protagonist in &ldquo;Oppenheimer&rdquo;), he realized &ldquo;uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.&rdquo; If ordinary people lack such talent and resilience, it&rsquo;s better to follow the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy, achieve wealth calmly and happily, without enduring those extreme pressures and risks. Investing slowly and waiting for the compounding effect is a good choice.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: Slow is fast. Don&rsquo;t use money you need to earn money you don&rsquo;t need. Life should be about reducing regrets, not chasing empty fame and fortune.

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Introduced to Mr. James&rsquo;s philosophy by a friend in 2018/2019. As a stock market novice, he was deeply inspired and immediately adjusted his strategy, investing borrowed funds and continuing with regular contributions. He once participated in short-term trading studies (joined a stock reading club) but found it arduous and the ROE (Return on Equity) not high. He had to watch the market daily, research US stocks, Taiwan stocks, margin changes, aiming for a 10-20% annualized return, and only dared to invest a portion of his capital (e.g., 10-30%). So he gave up, focused on his main job and long-term investing, and now lives a peaceful and prosperous life (meditating morning and evening). When sharing his philosophy with friends and colleagues, he found they hesitated to invest for their own long-term (feeling 20-30 years is too long), but were more receptive to investing for their children, which might then lead them to participate themselves. Having experienced 00662 (a Taiwanese Nasdaq 100 ETF) dropping from over 50 to the 40s and persisting in buying, he is now calm about current market fluctuations.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: Many short-term traders only look at the ROI (Return on Investment) of individual trades, ignoring the ROE (Return on Equity) on their total assets. They might achieve a high ROI with a small amount of capital, but it contributes little to overall wealth growth. For example, with 1 million in capital, using 30,000 to make 30,000 is a 100% ROI, but only a 3% ROE. Whereas we aim for a 10% return on the entire 1 million, which is 100,000.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Noticed Mr. James recently emphasizing conservatism more, suggesting a 30% cash position (earlier it was 10-20%). Is this due to varying student experience levels or other considerations? He himself targets a Beta of 1.0, holds leveraged funds, has little cash, and would need to reduce leveraged funds to reach 30% cash.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s reply: Yes, this is because students come from diverse backgrounds; many are novices or cannot withstand significant volatility. A 30% (or even 40%) cash position is a &ldquo;plain beef noodle soup&rdquo; style basic version, suitable for everyone to start with. Experienced investors who can tolerate risk can adjust it themselves, choosing a &ldquo;mildly spicy&rdquo; or &ldquo;extra spicy&rdquo; allocation. Asset allocation is very personal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Regarding wealth inheritance. Warren Buffett&rsquo;s testamentary portfolio (90% S&amp;P 500 + 10% short-term bonds) is suitable due to his vast assets. For ordinary people whose descendants have no interest in investing, how should a &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; trust asset allocation plan be established? (Citing Anita Mui&rsquo;s trust case)
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s reply:
<ul>
<li>Firstly, children&rsquo;s moral character and values education (quoting Lin Zexu: &ldquo;If my descendants are like me, what&rsquo;s the use of leaving them money? If my descendants are not like me, what&rsquo;s the use of leaving them money?&rdquo;) is more important than wealth inheritance. Wealth should be the icing on the cake.</li>
<li>One can start considering gifting when their assets exceed 50 times their annual expenses.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not advisable to easily set up a private non-profit foundation unless the children are genuinely committed, otherwise, it might become a burden or a management problem.</li>
<li>Trust selection: Trust services from large financial institutions (like HSBC, Charles Schwab) are generally more stable than private family offices (even if the institution fails, assets are protected, like Credit Suisse being taken over by UBS), but offer less flexibility. One can set up a portfolio like 70% QQQ / 30% cash (or short-term bonds/money market funds), with a rule to withdraw 2% annually, achieving perpetuity. The key is simplicity and low management fees. Private family offices might offer comprehensive services, but institutional trusts focus more on asset management and distribution.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Market fluctuations have nothing to do with me anymore. The market might be full of turmoil, tariffs coming and going, wars still ongoing, but the market is already close to new highs. So this is why you don&rsquo;t need to care about market signals; they are not important, not important at all.
&ndash; Mr. James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view emphasizes that investors should ignore short-term market noise and focus on long-term trends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This capitalism is a systemic trap&hellip; it&rsquo;s advantageous to the rich, to wealthy people.
&ndash; Mr. James (quoting and agreeing with a YouTuber&rsquo;s perspective)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view reveals the inherent mechanisms of wealth distribution under the capitalist system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earning money through physical labor will never keep up with inflation, let alone the speed of asset appreciation.
&ndash; Mr. James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view highlights the fundamental difference between labor income and capital appreciation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you calculate falling in love, getting married, and having children in terms of cost, then you&rsquo;re being too meticulous&hellip; We are rich people; money is meant to be spent. We&rsquo;ll have more money than we can spend in a lifetime, so if we get married and have children, let&rsquo;s have a few more to spend it together.
&ndash; Mr. James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view reminds people to look beyond utilitarian calculations in important life choices, focus on emotions and experiences, and view them from a long-term wealth perspective.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slowly is fast. You will all become a big tree for your family.
&ndash; Mr. James (combining the &ldquo;slow is fast&rdquo; and &ldquo;become a big tree&rdquo; concepts)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view encourages long-term patient investing, believing in the power of compounding to enable individuals to become the economic pillars of their families.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For any asset allocation, just ask yourself: what if the market goes to zero tomorrow, how would you fare? Ah, if you find out it&rsquo;s not okay, if I&rsquo;m finished if it goes to zero, then you should quickly adjust your asset allocation.
&ndash; Mr. James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view provides an ultimate test for measuring risk tolerance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone needs to know that in investing, all things can have unexpected outcomes. Your company can go bankrupt in an instant&hellip; So for any investment, the first thing to think about is what if this investment is destroyed, goes to zero, what will you do?
&ndash; Mr. James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view emphasizes risk awareness, that any investment should first consider the worst-case scenario.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think about making this money too quickly; a bit slower and safer might be better.
&ndash; Sams</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sams, after a severe setback with leverage, gained a profound understanding of prudent investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s the biggest advantage of investing well? It&rsquo;s that you can control your own destiny.
&ndash; Sams</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sams shared how investing gave him more agency and security amidst career and life changes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spending five minutes a year is enough. There&rsquo;s absolutely no need to care about market fluctuations; it&rsquo;s completely meaningless&hellip; Living a good life is the purpose of life.
&ndash; Mr. James</p>

<p>This view advocates for simplifying investment management and dedicating more energy to life itself.</p>

<p>In this CLEC sharing session, Mr. James once again emphasized the importance of long-term holding of quality assets (especially the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund) and reminded investors to ignore market noise and focus on their own investment discipline. He deeply analyzed the operational mechanisms of capitalism, pointing out that ordinary people can achieve wealth growth through capital markets and escape the &ldquo;laborer mindset.&rdquo; The discussion covered several important topics, including risk management (especially a cautious attitude towards using leverage, advising most to start with a conservative cash ratio, and conducting the &ldquo;market goes to zero&rdquo; test), the wisdom of wealth inheritance (emphasizing children&rsquo;s moral education first and suggesting simple, sustainable trust solutions through financial institutions), elderly care for parents (prioritizing health management over financial worries), and balancing investment with life happiness (avoiding excessive calculation of &ldquo;costs&rdquo; in life, living in the present, and achieving the state of &ldquo;Die with Zero&rdquo;). Participants&rsquo; sharing also provided valuable practical experiences and lessons, particularly regarding leverage risks, market liquidity, and the profound impact of investment on personal control over one&rsquo;s destiny. Overall, this session aimed to help investors establish the correct investment mindset and methodology to achieve long-term financial health and a fulfilling life.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Sell Stocks</strong>: Market volatility is normal and irrelevant to the goals of long-term investors; do not sell stocks because of it. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sell stocks, don&rsquo;t sell stocks, don&rsquo;t sell stocks&rdquo; is the core discipline.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Asset Allocation</strong>: Proper asset allocation (e.g., retirees at least 30% cash, or 10-15 years of living expenses; young people at least 1 year of living expenses in cash) ensures a worry-free life during extreme market conditions (such as the 10-year market downturn after the 2000 tech bubble), preventing panicked and reckless operations.
<ul>
<li>For example, with 2% annual living expenses, holding 15 years of cash means 30% cash. If holding 40% cash, then there are 20 years of living expenses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Harm of Reckless Operations</strong>: Some people panic due to market declines after pledging stocks, and their reckless operations lead to difficult situations. If you have enough cash and don&rsquo;t operate recklessly, there won&rsquo;t be problems.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding Market Phenomena</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical Phenomenon vs. Chemical Phenomenon</strong>: Events like tariff wars are physical phenomena (like blowing up a balloon, there&rsquo;s push and pull, eventually finding an equilibrium), not chemical phenomena (permanent change, irreversible). Therefore, short-term factors like international situations, market analysis, financial reports, economic conditions, and celebrity remarks (e.g., Trump&rsquo;s speeches) are irrelevant to long-term investment strategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Beware of Inner &ldquo;Demons and Monsters&rdquo;</strong>:
<ul>
<li>When thoughts like &ldquo;What should I do if the market drops next?&rdquo; or &ldquo;The market keeps rising, I should sell some and buy back when it falls?&rdquo; arise, these are inner &ldquo;demons and monsters&rdquo; at play, a very dangerous signal, and such thinking should stop immediately.</li>
<li>When you think, &ldquo;Wow, I&rsquo;ve made so much money, I&rsquo;ve struck it rich, I&rsquo;m wealthy!&rdquo; this is also a dangerous signal; greed has appeared.</li>
<li>When you think, &ldquo;How can it keep falling like this? What if the market drops to zero, what will I do?&rdquo; this is the emergence of the &ldquo;demon&rdquo; of fear.</li>
<li>Greed and fear stem from feelings about the market. View the market like a variety show; financial media and analysts are like hosts and guests—just laugh it off. If you can watch market fluctuations (like a 10% rise or fall in a day) without any inner turmoil, then you can pay attention to the market.</li>
<li>The goal is &ldquo;it will definitely rise in 20 years&rdquo;; short-term corrections are normal.</li>

<li><strong>Wisdom and Destiny</strong>: Those who can watch the videos and follow through have wisdom and good destiny. Others watch, think they understand, but operate recklessly.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging and Repayment</strong>: Once you pledge stocks and borrow money, you should be determined not to repay (the principal) for the rest of your life before you borrow. Otherwise, you should not pledge.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Do What You Don&rsquo;t Understand</strong>: Those who don&rsquo;t understand financial tools like Beta, leverage, etc. (e.g., can&rsquo;t even calculate Beta), should stick to investing only in index funds (like QQQ) and keep ample cash. 70% investment, 30% cash can also lead to a good life.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage is Not Essential</strong>: Leverage and stock pledging are ways to deeply understand financial operations, but they are not necessary conditions for wealth, suitable for a few who truly understand, are not afraid, and can withstand their volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of Groups and Private Chats</strong>: Teacher James has no official groups. Any group using the CLEC name may be unauthorized or a scam.

<ul>
<li><strong>Always Extremely Optimistic, Always Sunny</strong>: Firmly believe the market will always rise and reach new highs. QQQ at $540 will definitely be surpassed; it might reach $50,000, $500,000 in the future (a 100-fold increase is a small case in the market). 00662 might reach NT$90,000, NT$900,000 in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Volatility is Not Risk</strong>: Market decline after buying is not a risk; not being in the market is the risk. Don&rsquo;t regret not buying QQQ at $500 when it reaches $50,000.
<ul>
<li>Looking back: In 2022, when QQQ hit a low of over $200, everyone was terrified. Now it&rsquo;s over $500. The previous high of $408 was also called a high point; it was underwater for a year, and now it&rsquo;s back and hitting new highs. So what if you buy at $540 and it drops? In a few years, you&rsquo;ll be fine again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Investment Pace</strong>: Buy when you have money, invest in batches. Achieve the &ldquo;golden mean&rdquo; of being happy when it rises and comfortable when it falls (because you can buy cheaper shares).</li>
<li><strong>QQQ Performance Over the Past Year</strong>: Up 15.38%. If you haven&rsquo;t made over 10% in the past year, you&rsquo;re failing. You get this return even without active trading. Ignore recent volatility. During Trump&rsquo;s tariff war, it fell over 20%, institutions fled, and ended up missing out later. Investors who have calmly weathered the year-to-date volatility are doing great.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Student Case Background</strong>: A student (email inquiry) mentioned a short-term &ldquo;crazy 10% appreciation&rdquo; of the NTD against the USD (Teacher James pointed out it should be &ldquo;depreciation,&rdquo; but the subsequent discussion revolved around the student&rsquo;s sense of &ldquo;loss,&rdquo; suggesting the student meant NTD appreciation led to a relative drop in the NTD value of their USD assets). The student held 00864B (a USD bond ETF) and experienced a paper &ldquo;loss&rdquo; due to exchange rate changes. He also mentioned pledging over NT$30 million and borrowing NT$6.6 million (20%), which Teacher James criticized as &ldquo;courting disaster&rdquo; behavior—pledging and immediately borrowing to reinvest. A slight 10% drop in the market (referring to the value of USD assets relative to NTD) caused him to panic.</li>
<li><strong>Student&rsquo;s Questions</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Should the 00864B portion not be transferred to 00865B? (Because a transfer would mean &ldquo;immediate loss&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Will the USD continue to depreciate against the NTD? Should the money market funds remain in 00864B?</li>
<li>Can 00864B be transferred to 00662 (QQQ)?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Analysis and Criticism</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Human Fragility and Ignorance is Bliss</strong>: The student&rsquo;s behavior exposed pretending to understand, reckless bravery born of ignorance (like pledging and immediately borrowing a large sum to reinvest), and human fragility in the face of real market volatility (even currency fund exchange rate fluctuations). Like the &ldquo;Boxers&rdquo; (义和团), not learning leads to being plundered.</li>
<li><strong>Prohibition on Borrowing to Immediately Reinvest</strong>: Repeatedly emphasized that borrowing against pledged stock, especially a large one-time sum for reinvestment, is extremely dangerous.</li>
<li><strong>Short-term Exchange Rates are Unpredictable</strong>: Even the US central bank cannot predict short-term exchange rates and interest rates; investors should not worry about this. Financial media predictions are either from charlatans or liars.</li>
<li><strong>Act Immediately, Forget Sunk Costs</strong>: If a fund switch is necessary (00864B to 00865B, assuming it&rsquo;s a similar but superior fund), act immediately. Don&rsquo;t consider so-called &ldquo;losses&rdquo; or wait to &ldquo;break even.&rdquo; This is kindergarten-level financial thinking. 00864B and 00865B (if similar assets) will move mostly in tandem; waiting for one to break even means the other will have risen too.</li>
<li><strong>Severe Misconception of Risk</strong>: Being scared by a 4% paper &ldquo;loss&rdquo; in a very low-volatility money market fund (or short-term bond ETF) due to short-term exchange rate fluctuations, to the point of wanting to switch to a highly volatile stock fund (00662), is a massive risk perception error. QQQ/00662 could fall 80% within 10 years.</li>
<li><strong>Role of Cash</strong>: Cash (held in money market funds) is like the &ldquo;air force&rdquo; in a strategy, protecting ground troops (stock investments like QQQ/00662 and leveraged funds). The air force cannot be used as infantry.</li>
<li><strong>Those Unable to Bear Volatility Should Not Invest</strong>: If one cannot even bear minor exchange rate fluctuations in a money market fund (like the 10% perceived by the student) and panics because of it, then one is not suited for investing at all and should leave the market immediately, or face bankruptcy sooner or later.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term Exchange Rate Mean Reversion</strong>: In the long run (e.g., observed over 30 years), NTD exchange rate fluctuations will tend towards a mean (e.g., within a 22%-30% range up or down). As long as USD assets are held long enough (e.g., over 10 years), the expected return on USD assets (e.g., 3% annual money market yield, 34% over 10 years) far outweighs potential losses from exchange rate fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility Has Nothing to Do with Me</strong>: If this exchange rate fluctuation makes you nervous, it shows you are not suited for investing.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Requirement for Pledged Loans</strong>: When taking out stock-pledged loans, the cash (or cash equivalents) held should, under certain models, especially initially or when the market hasn&rsquo;t fallen significantly, be greater than the loan amount. Teacher James mentioned his 433 model (40% QQQ, 30% leverage, 30% cash) where, after an 80% market drop, cash might be close to or slightly less than the loan, but the overall position remains safe. If this is uncomfortable, a more conservative allocation like 424 (40% QQQ, 20% leverage, 40% cash) or 505 (50% QQQ, 50% cash, smart rebalancing) can be chosen.</li>
<li><strong>Minimum 30% Cash</strong>: At least 30% of investable assets should be allocated to cash (or money market funds). This is the first step. If you don&rsquo;t understand why you need cash, you cannot invest; you will go bankrupt.</li>
<li><strong>Cash as Living Expenses Standard</strong>: For working individuals, 30% cash should cover at least one year of living expenses. If funds are insufficient to cover one year&rsquo;s living expenses, one should not invest. Young people, after starting work, should first save a one-year emergency fund; subsequent salary can then be invested.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Horizon</strong>: Investing is a plan for 10+ years. Money needed within 10 years (e.g., children&rsquo;s tuition, down payment for a house) should not be used for high-volatility investments.</li>
<li><strong>Risks and Conditions for Buying Property</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Not recommended for young people to buy property easily, unless they have sufficient cash flow or can buy two houses as easily as buying slippers (with the mentality of buying a new pair if one breaks).</li>
<li>Concentrating investment in a single property is extremely risky (e.g., earthquake risk), violating the principle of diversification (QQQ diversifies across 100 companies).</li>
<li>The financial industry generally claims one should not concentrate bets or gamble on individual stocks, yet encourages the public to buy property (concentrated investment). This is contradictory; many practitioners either don&rsquo;t understand or are &ldquo;scammers.&rdquo; Teacher James mentioned being invited by a Taiwanese TV station to talk against buying property but declined, unwilling to become a public target.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Learn Investment Philosophy, Not Mimicry</strong>: Learn from masters like Buffett, Peter Lynch their investment philosophy (e.g., don&rsquo;t fear market volatility; Buffett encountered market drops of 10%+ annually and 20%+ every five years), not their specific stock-picking methods or asset allocation ratios. You can never mimic them.</li>
<li><strong>Cash for Retirees</strong>: Cash reserves need to cover 10+ years of expenses, ensuring that even if the market (e.g., QQQ/00662) goes to zero in an extreme scenario, and leveraged funds also go to zero, you can still live comfortably and at ease.</li>
<li><strong>Where to Keep Cash</strong>: In Taiwan, it&rsquo;s 00865B; in the US, it&rsquo;s BIL or SGOV, etc. (money market funds).</li>

<li><strong>Taiwan Tax Reference</strong>: Mentioned a PDF file from Cathay United Bank regarding Taiwan taxes. Tools like ChatGPT can assist in understanding, but questions need to be logical, and AI answers are for reference only, not to be fully trusted. Teacher James stated his trained ChatGPT has not yet reached AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) level.</li>
<li><strong>Proactive Learning</strong>: When encountering problems, first search for information and learn independently. Don&rsquo;t treat Teacher James as a secretary or search engine. For example, what a money market fund is, you should look it up yourself. If you still don&rsquo;t understand after researching, you can list what you found and your confusion when asking.</li>
<li><strong>Your Biggest Enemy is Yourself</strong>: The best antidote to inner fear and greed is robust asset allocation and an ample cash level. When greedy, hold onto cash; when fearful, hold onto stocks. Asset allocation itself is to mitigate risk.</li>
<li><strong>Health and Longevity are Paramount</strong>: Health and longevity are key to achieving wealth compounding. Buffett is Buffett largely because he lived into his 90s. 96% of his wealth was earned after age 60 (a 25-fold increase in 30 years, about 11% annualized, similar to SPY). If you live that long with QQQ, your asset growth will be far more than 25 times, possibly 100 times.</li>
<li><strong>Volatility is the Entry Fee</strong>: View short-term paper &ldquo;losses&rdquo; from market volatility as an entry fee to the market, or &ldquo;withholding tax&rdquo; (it will be returned to you later), not a fine. Missing out on market upswings by not being in the market is a permanent loss (e.g., missing the 10 best days in the past 20 years might yield only 25% of the total return, while staying in the market could yield 17 times).</li>

<li>Question 1: In Canada, investing in QQQ monthly, but bank (RBC/TD) transaction fees are high (approx. 9.99 CAD/trade), which is not cost-effective for small regular investments. Asks if there are low-fee platforms?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Recommends checking the message board; some students have recommended WealthSimple or Interactive Brokers (IBKR).</li>
<li>Other student (Lin) adds: Questrade, if it&rsquo;s a self-directed account and meets asset requirements (e.g., 10,000 CAD+), might offer free trading. National Bank&rsquo;s brokerage services might also offer free trading and can link to bank accounts for direct transfers.</li>
<li>Other student (unnamed male) adds: Questrade&rsquo;s mobile trading platform might offer free commissions under certain conditions and has a regular investment feature, but specific fees need confirmation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: When buying Canadian QQQ ETFs, some are Hedged (HG), some are Non-Hedged (NH), how to choose? QQC vs QQQ selection?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: For Canadian investors, recommends buying <code>HXQ.TO</code>. It doesn&rsquo;t pay dividends (dividends are reinvested), avoiding withholding tax issues, and it&rsquo;s Hedged.</li>
<li>Other student (Lin) adds: <code>QQC.TO</code> (CAD-denominated) allows purchasing fractional shares, suitable for small regular investments (e.g., 150 CAD monthly). <code>HXQ.TO</code> (currently around 80+ CAD per share) requires whole share purchases.</li>
<li>Other student (unnamed male) adds: CAD-denominated QQC might have slightly higher gains than directly buying QQQ with USD due to currency conversion operations. Buying directly with CAD is also simpler for tax reporting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: What&rsquo;s the difference between using a brokerage platform and a bank platform for trading?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James and other students reply: Brokerage platforms are specialized investment accounts; a bank&rsquo;s investment services might be an independent department or outsourced. In Canada and the US, there&rsquo;s a firewall between brokerage and commercial banking. Using brokerage platforms directly (like Questrade, IBKR, WealthSimple) is usually more professional, and fees might be lower. Be aware that banks might try to sell packaged financial products; insist on buying pure ETFs.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: Early on (2018), saw Teacher James&rsquo;s &ldquo;One Hundred Million Dollar Investment Lecture&rdquo; on Bilibili but didn&rsquo;t think much of it. After years of ups and downs in A-shares and overseas investments (overseas funds invested for nearly 10 years without profit, until inventory at the beginning of this year). Now almost 50, feels like time was wasted. After re-encountering Teacher James&rsquo;s investment philosophy (buy when you have money, hold to death, only buy never sell), took out a portfolio loan through HSBC Hong Kong, allocating 70% QQQ, 10% TQQQ, and 20% MME (should be META). Experienced a significant market pullback in April (TQQQ dropped from purchase price near $90 to $35), but because of belief in Teacher James&rsquo;s philosophy, felt no inner turmoil, calm and composed, firmly believing volatility is not risk, and with proper asset allocation and cash reserves, there&rsquo;s nothing to fear. Studied nearly 200 of Teacher James&rsquo;s lessons, moving from understanding to faith, believing in humanity, the US, and technology, enabling steadfast holding. Teacher James is a benefactor on his investment journey.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Thanks for sharing, excellent mentality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Information on HSBC Hong Kong portfolio loans: Currently, one-month HIBOR is about 1.2%, plus the bank&rsquo;s spread, total interest is no more than 2.4%, very low. At HSBC, BIL (should be SGOV or similar short-term Treasury ETF) and leveraged funds (TQQQ, etc.) cannot be used as collateral, but SGOV can, with a loan-to-value ratio up to 90%; QQQ&rsquo;s LTV is 70%. SGOV dividends are subject to 10% withholding tax (for mainland China residents after signing W8 form), but since it&rsquo;s US Treasury interest, it&rsquo;s theoretically tax-exempt, and HSBC will refund this 10% in March/April of the following year. This method of not selling stocks, not repaying principal, and not paying interest (referring to net interest cost) through pledging is very helpful for mainland Chinese investors to avoid taxes on overseas investment income (dividends, capital gains) being investigated (recently discussed on Xueqiu), because as long as you don&rsquo;t sell, there are no realized capital gains or dividends.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: This method (not selling, pledging to borrow) is applicable to investors worldwide and can legally avoid many taxes. The key is &ldquo;buy when you have money, hold to death, never repay stock-pledged loans (principal), and borrow (through asset allocation) without paying (net) interest.&rdquo; Watson broke through the psychological barrier of &ldquo;why borrow money when I have cash,&rdquo; understanding that cash is also an asset that needs to continuously grow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: If one withdraws no more than 2% from pledged assets annually for living expenses, and this 2% is not fully used, should the remaining portion be left as is (not borrowed), or can the unused portion of the borrowed money be reinvested into the QQQ/TQQQ portfolio?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Either is fine. Reinvesting the unused portion is okay, not reinvesting is also fine; whatever makes you comfortable. If the market is falling, you can buy; if the market is rising, you can ignore it. The core is to buy when you have money, at the market price, immediately. Since you are already financially free, the extra funds just increase your inheritance, not a necessary operation.</li>

<li>Sharing: After rewatching Teacher James&rsquo;s videos, his investment philosophy has improved greatly. Fortunate to be able to jump directly from ignorance to a state of &ldquo;non-action&rdquo; (wu wei), skipping the intermediate stages of &ldquo;not knowing one is ignorant,&rdquo; &ldquo;cleverness,&rdquo; &ldquo;from non-action to action.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Question 1: Teacher James once said wealth has tiers (million for food freedom, ten million for financial freedom, one hundred million for housing freedom and helping family, one billion for helping the poor, ten billion for helping society/seeking longevity). The &ldquo;hold to death&rdquo; strategy might cause assets to fluctuate significantly between these tiers (e.g., from 100 million down to 30 million). How to psychologically overcome the feeling of falling from a higher freedom tier, even knowing it&rsquo;s temporary volatility? (For example, eating without looking at prices when assets are high, then reflecting on not being so complacent when assets fall back.)
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The key is to focus on <strong>cash flow</strong> rather than short-term fluctuations in total assets. Whether working or retired, your annual disposable cash flow should be relatively fixed (e.g., annual income 3 million, spend 1.2 million, reinvest 1.8 million), unaffected by market ups and downs. Don&rsquo;t change your spending habits because of market fluctuations. If you want to increase living expenses due to significant asset growth (e.g., from 60 million to 120 million) (e.g., from 2% of original assets to 2% of new assets, increasing cash flow from 1.2 million to 2.4 million, spending an extra 1.2 million), you should first re-evaluate and adjust your asset allocation (e.g., reduce Beta from 1.0 to lower, increase cash proportion) to ensure the new cash flow plan is sustainable. After that, your life should no longer be affected by market volatility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Why is the rebalancing frequency chosen as once a year? (Saw an author who tried different frequencies and concluded there&rsquo;s no optimum, once a year is about right.)
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Once a year is based on intuition and common sense. Two years is too long, volatility might be too great, reducing rebalancing efficiency (e.g., if it rises 50% this year, annual rebalancing is efficient; over two years, volatility might be smoothed out, reducing efficiency). Daily rebalancing is theoretically most efficient but impractical (becomes short-term trading) and incurs high transaction costs and tax issues. Once a year strikes a good balance between efficiency and practicability, and also aligns well with tax reporting (e.g., in the US).</li>

<li>Sharing: Observed that the market mostly rises slowly (e.g., 0.x% daily, leveraged funds 1.x%), but when it falls (e.g., president talks about trade war), the decline is larger (5%, 10%, 20%). This is like life, mostly mundane daily routines, but long-term accumulation (power of compounding) can lead to huge changes. Work hard, live well, and you can ultimately lead a happy life.

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Well said. Plainness is a blessing, safety first, stable profits. Without safety, everything else is false; without health, everything else is false. Health and safety are prerequisites for enjoying wealth. Like the example of Bill Gates (or Steve Jobs), his high school had an expensive computer (a one-in-ten-thousand chance of luck), and he learned programming; but another equally talented classmate unfortunately died while mountain climbing (a one-in-ten-thousand chance of disaster). One must first avoid disaster for luck to be meaningful.</li>

<li>Sharing: Watched the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting. Warren Buffett, though 94 years old (born 1930) and having experienced WWII and countless storms, repeatedly emphasized four or five times within three to four hours how lucky he was to be born in America as a white male. This echoes Teacher James&rsquo;s emphasis on &ldquo;always be optimistic, embrace the sunshine.&rdquo; If I hadn&rsquo;t listened to Teacher James&rsquo;s classes, I might not have understood Buffett&rsquo;s expression and would have found it insincere. Now I understand; he certainly had bad things happen in his life, but he chose optimism.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Very well said. Be grateful every day, stay optimistic, think positively (&ldquo;I am great, I am good, I am very rich, all the money in the world is mine&rdquo;), and the universe will respond to your positive energy. The world is as you perceive it.</li>

<li>Supplement on Canadian brokerage information: Questrade, if it&rsquo;s a self-directed account and meets asset requirements (e.g., 10,000 CAD+, annual management fee might be waived), offers zero-commission trading. National Bank&rsquo;s brokerage services might also offer free trading (mainly starting in French-speaking regions). HXQ.TO must be bought in whole shares, QQC.TO can be bought in fractional shares, suitable for small regular investments (e.g., only 150 CAD per month, HXQ.TO is over 80 CAD per share, so can only buy one share).</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: Before and after attending the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting, encountered two groups of people: one group was value investors like Li Lu, who emphasized ignoring market volatility (Mr. Market&rsquo;s emotions), believing index investing is also a form of value investing (natural growth of the economy after removing speculation). They also emphasized community support, making an annual &ldquo;pilgrimage&rdquo; to Omaha.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: The other group was insurance agents, also using Buffett&rsquo;s theories (Berkshire Hathaway has insurance business), discussing asset management, inheritance, financial literacy education (e.g., allocating 401k, Roth IRA), but their ultimate goal was to sell life insurance.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Be wary of insurance agents. Insurance is transferring your money to the insurance company&rsquo;s pocket; it&rsquo;s essentially &ldquo;the scam group within the financial scam conglomerate.&rdquo; Buffett says insurance is a good business—for the insurance company, not for the policyholder. Insurance agents use financial literacy education as a disguise, making it highly deceptive.</li>

<li>Question: Taiwanese products offer good value for money (e.g., Meet Fresh is $10 in the US, Taiwan has many cheaper options), but the NTD seems undervalued. If the NTD appreciates significantly in the future as Teacher James suggested (e.g., from 30:1 USD to 15:1 or even 10:1), for Taiwanese investors in US stock ETFs (like 00662, with an annualized return of about 12-14%), will their long-term returns denominated in NTD be eroded by exchange rates, leading to less-than-expected growth in purchasing power? (A boss&rsquo;s mentality might be to hope for NTD depreciation to benefit exports, sacrificing employee welfare).
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>NTD appreciation is good for Taiwan. It will be cheaper for people to buy imported goods (e.g., iPhone from NT$30,000 to NT$10,000) and travel abroad, improving quality of life. High-pollution, uncompetitive industries (like uncompetitive steel, unless for national defense) will naturally be eliminated; they shouldn&rsquo;t be subsidized by sacrificing public welfare and the environment.</li>
<li>For Taiwanese investors already invested in USD assets, NTD appreciation will indeed affect NTD-denominated returns. However, one can consider allocating to some NTD-hedged ETFs (like Taiwan&rsquo;s 00670L Fubon NASDAQ Leveraged 2x, although it&rsquo;s a leveraged ETF, Teacher James might be referring to its hedging characteristic here or using it as an example that such tools exist).</li>
<li>In the long run, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations is far less than the growth of quality assets. Even if the annualized return drops from 14% to 7% due to exchange rates, it&rsquo;s still a good return. One shouldn&rsquo;t worry excessively about exchange rates.</li>
<li>After NTD appreciation, buying USD assets in the future will be cheaper (e.g., QQQ from NT$15,000 to NT$5,000), which is actually beneficial. An undervalued NTD deprives the entire population of welfare to benefit a few manufacturers.</li>

<li>Question: Regarding Roth portions in tax-deferred retirement accounts like 403(b) and 457(b) (up to $30,500 can be contributed annually), are they also subject to Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) at age 73 or 75? If so, can they be rolled over tax-free to a personal Roth IRA account without an amount limit? What are the precautions during operation (e.g., need to sell then transfer)?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Funds in Roth 403(b)/457(b), after meeting conditions, can be rolled over tax-free to a personal Roth IRA. This avoids RMD issues because personal Roth IRAs do not have RMDs during the owner&rsquo;s lifetime. Operationally, contact the brokerage to handle it; you can choose cash transfer or in-kind transfer (assets transferred directly, if the brokerage supports it and the investment holdings are the same, like QQQ). It&rsquo;s advisable to choose the brokerage link option within 403(b)/457(b) as much as possible to invest in quality targets like QQQ, rather than being limited to a few poor-performing funds offered by the plan. If you can only choose funds, don&rsquo;t contribute; deposit directly into a Roth IRA.</li>

<li>Question: Regarding Pledged Line of Credit (PLOC), a friend doesn&rsquo;t understand why one would borrow money and pay interest when having enough cash or stock gains. How to simply explain its benefits? (Friend&rsquo;s argument: I have money from stock trading, why borrow and pay interest?)
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Capital Efficiency and Compounding</strong>: Using your own money for living expenses (e.g., spending $20,000 annually) means reducing the principal available for investment. Borrowing for living expenses (e.g., borrowing $20,000) allows the original principal (e.g., $1 million) to continue growing at a higher rate (e.g., 10%). Even after paying interest (e.g., 5%), there&rsquo;s still a net gain (5% arbitrage). After 30 years, the borrower&rsquo;s net worth (total assets minus debt) will be far higher than that of the investor who spends their own money (Teacher James gave an example, the former has $3 million more).</li>
<li><strong>Tax Advantages</strong>: Not selling stocks means no capital gains tax.</li>
<li><strong>Possibility of Interest Deduction</strong>: Interest on loans may be tax-deductible under specific circumstances (e.g., treating long-term capital gains as short-term, forgoing preferential tax rates) (complex operation, consult a professional accountant; many accountants don&rsquo;t understand this).</li>
<li><strong>Net Interest Cost is Zero or Negative</strong>: Through proper asset allocation (like Teacher James&rsquo;s 433 model: 40% QQQ, 30% QLD/TQQQ, 30% cash/money market fund), the interest generated by money market funds (e.g., $300,000 cash generating 4.5% or $13,500 interest) can cover or even exceed the interest expense of pledged loans (e.g., borrowing $200,000, 5% interest is $10,000), achieving &ldquo;borrowing money without paying interest&rdquo; or even making money, while the portfolio&rsquo;s Beta remains at 1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term Asset Growth and Risk (Counter-intuitive)</strong>: Over the long term, the total assets of an investor who borrows will be far higher than one who spends their own money. Continuously spending principal leads to principal depletion (e.g., $1 million becomes $400,000 after 30 years, then $100,000 after another 10 years, unable to afford a bento box). Borrowing and letting the principal grow continuously, even with debt, results in better sustainability of total assets (still $1 million principal growing) and cash flow, thus lower risk.
Teacher James emphasized this is one of his core strategies, requiring students to watch the videos from the beginning to fully understand.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Market volatility has nothing to do with us, so don&rsquo;t sell stocks, don&rsquo;t sell stocks, don&rsquo;t sell stocks.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view is a core investment discipline repeatedly emphasized by Teacher James: maintain composure in the face of market volatility and stick to the strategy of long-term holding of quality assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You only run into problems if you are afraid. If you sell your stocks, always remember one thing: keep enough cash. Retirees might need to keep 10-15 years&rsquo; worth, at least 30% or more in cash.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Teacher James stresses the importance of ample cash reserves for overcoming fear and avoiding erroneous operations, providing cash reserve suggestions for different groups of people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greed and fear are like that. Because you feel the market, it causes your greed&hellip; you find your assets have exploded&hellip; you&rsquo;re about to become a superior person, then greed has appeared, and risk will follow. When the market drops, you become very fearful, very fearful, very fearful&hellip; then this fear emerges.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Profoundly reveals the common extreme emotions of investors in the market and their dangers, reminding investors to remain rational.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cash is air. You must maintain the highest level of cash to survive. In the overall strategy, cash is like the air force, protecting the ground troops from annihilation.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uses a vivid metaphor to emphasize the strategic position of cash in an investment portfolio, as key to resisting risk and ensuring survival.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our method isn&rsquo;t just for China; even if you&rsquo;re in Taiwan or the US, you don&rsquo;t need to pay taxes because we don&rsquo;t sell. No selling means no taxes. Learn this trick: stock pledge loans are never repaid (principal), and the loan (through asset allocation) incurs no (net) interest.
&ndash; Teacher James (partially echoing Watson&rsquo;s sharing)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Explains the strategy of achieving tax optimization and wealth growth through long-term holding, not selling, and skillfully using stock pledge loans (combined with asset allocation to make interest costs manageable).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You just need to be optimistic, optimistic, I am great, I am good, I am very rich, all the money in the world is mine. You need to chant this every day: I am great, I am good. I am the best person in the world. That&rsquo;s enough. All good luck will come to you.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasizes the importance of positive psychological suggestion and an optimistic mindset for investment and even life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When investing, you must treat the losses brought by volatility, these temporary losses, as the entry fee for the market, not a fine.
&ndash; Teacher James (quoting an online viewpoint)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Provides a positive perspective on market volatility and short-term paper losses, helping investors maintain a long-term mindset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We make money without paying taxes, borrow money without paying (net) interest, and we hold to death, never selling (principal). This is our highest realm.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summarizes the ideal state of his investment strategy, emphasizing tax efficiency, cost control, and long-term holding.</p>

<p>In this lecture, Teacher James once again systematically emphasized his core investment philosophy: long-term holding of quality assets (like the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund), ignoring short-term market volatility and noise, maintaining sufficient cash reserves, and applying a reasonable asset allocation strategy. Teacher James sternly refuted panic and erroneous operations arising from short-term market or exchange rate fluctuations and detailed the correct use of stock pledge loans where &ldquo;principal is never repaid, and (net) interest is controllable.&rdquo; Through questions and sharing from multiple students, the lecture covered specific concerns of investors from different regions including Canada, Mainland China, Taiwan, and the US, touching upon brokerage selection, fees, tax planning, retirement account management, and overcoming psychological investment barriers. Teacher James consistently conveyed an extremely optimistic investment belief and reminded investors to be wary of financial scams, focus on learning correct investment knowledge, and ultimately achieve financial freedom and life happiness.</p>

      <description>In this episode, James first announced the upcoming two-week Clubhouse hiatus and then emphasized that market volatility is normal and there&amp;#39;s no need to over-analyze the reasons behind it. The core arguments revolved around the importance of long-term investing and index funds (especially the Nasdaq 100), and discussed the selection of specific ETFs (such as 00864B/00865B, BRK, HXQ). He also shared his fantasies about the future development of AI, exploring its potential impact on social structures, work, and the meaning of life. The Q&amp;amp;A session covered a range of practical issues, including market predictions, asset allocation ratios (70/30 rule, Beta value), ETF selection in different countries, digital currency risks, differences in investment philosophies between spouses, and retirement cash reserves.</description>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market Volatility is Normal</strong>: The market is always fluctuating; this is the unchanging rule. No need to analyze specific reasons (international situation, trade war, financial report forecasts, etc.). Many analysts themselves do not truly understand. The market is like the sea, unaffected by streams and storms.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Investing</strong>: True investment is buying with the intention of never selling. Intending to sell at a high point is speculation. Investment must be long-term.</li>
<li><strong>Index Investing</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Recommendation</strong>: Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQQ and its global equivalents). Reason: Compared to the S&amp;P 500 (500 companies, possibly 450 &ldquo;bad companies&rdquo;), the Nasdaq 100 focuses more on high-quality technology companies, aligning with the &ldquo;the bigger, the stronger&rdquo; trend.</li>
<li><strong>Retirees/Those with Less Capital</strong>: Consider Taiwan 0056 or US SPHD (dividend yield ~3.5%, providing stable cash flow).</li>
<li><strong>Nasdaq 100 ETF List</strong>: Provides a list of relevant ETFs including various countries (Canada HXQ.t, Singapore, Malaysia, Norway, UK, Australia, etc.). HXQ.t is recommended because it does not pay dividends (tax-free).</li>
<li><strong>Historical Experience</strong>: Watching videos since 2018 can provide insights into investor sentiment and responses during market fluctuations, giving a sense of the long-term perspective.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stay Optimistic</strong>: Investors need to be extremely optimistic, always facing the sunlight, believing that the market will be good in the long run, even if there is a world war, the market still exists and continues to rise (only rises, never falls).</li>
<li><strong>Investment Target Selection</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>00864B vs 00865B (Taiwan Bond ETF)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>00864B: Pays dividends, generating National Health Insurance Supplementary Premium (2.11%), requires manual reinvestment (with handling fees, easy to forget resulting in no compounding), dividends are considered overseas income (requires declaration if it exceeds the limit, but usually not a problem with annual income below NT$1 million; according to student feedback, it is exempt from the second-generation health insurance supplementary premium).</li>
<li>00865B: Does not pay dividends, avoiding the above problems, simpler and more effective in the long run. Low trading volume is not a problem (market makers provide liquidity), initial performance differences will shrink as scale increases. <strong>Strongly recommend switching to 00865B; convenience is a value.</strong> Conversion will incur a one-time transaction cost, but worth it in the long run.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/B)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Not recommended for investment</strong>. Reason: Actively managed fund, more volatile than the index; times are changing, performance has lagged behind the S&amp;P 500; uncertainty after Buffett (&ldquo;the devil will come out&rdquo;); learning Buffett should be about learning his long-term investment spirit, investment discourse (such as the definition of investment), rather than stock picking. Investing in the S&amp;P 500 may be better than investing in BRK.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation (Beta)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic Principle</strong>: It is recommended that most people allocate an investment portfolio with a Beta value of less than 1, such as 70% index funds + 30% cash/money market funds (Beta is approximately 0.7).</li>
<li><strong>Risk Tolerance</strong>: The recent 20% drop has made many people uncomfortable (even those with a Beta of 1.2 configured at 4:4:2), indicating that actual risk tolerance may be lower than expected. Do not sacrifice the comfort of holding enough cash (&ldquo;don&rsquo;t gamble with the money you need for the money you don&rsquo;t need&rdquo;) for an extra 1-2% of return.</li>
<li><strong>Adjustment</strong>: If the initial Beta is high (such as 1.2), it is recommended to review it at the end of each year. If the market rises, you can sell part of the leveraged/index position and supplement the cash to more than 30%, gradually reducing the Beta to below 1.0. Consider smart rebalancing after the Beta is below 1.0.</li>

<li><strong>AI Optimized Future</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Productivity greatly improved, most output is completed by AI (robots), and the cost of goods approaches zero.</li>
<li>Total social wealth accelerates, basic living needs (food, clothing, housing, transportation) may be free, uniformly supplied by the state/society (AI robots complete production, construction, and maintenance).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Social Structure Changes</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Classes Still Exist</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Capitalists</strong>: Earn profits by investing in and holding the means of production (AI systems) without labor; the wealthiest. Everyone can become a capitalist (just need to know how to invest).</li>
<li><strong>High-Tech Workers</strong>: Personnel who maintain and manage AI systems, with excellent income, can enjoy entertainment beyond basic needs (such as space travel), but may fall into the &ldquo;cared-for&rdquo; class if they stop working and do not become capitalists.</li>
<li><strong>Cared-For Class (approximately 80%)</strong>: No need to work, basic life is guaranteed (food, clothing, housing, transportation, medical care), but cannot enjoy additional entertainment or resources. The standard of living may be similar to the current upper-middle class, but without work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Philosophical Challenges</strong>:
<ul>
<li>When most people do not need to contribute for livelihood (&ldquo;nothing to serve&rdquo;), what is the meaning and purpose of life? (Analogous to being idle after retirement). May lead to widespread depression or social problems.</li>
<li>Human development may enter a stage of eternal life, facing greater philosophical and existential questions.</li>
<li>The focus should shift from &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; to &ldquo;the meaning of life.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Implications for Investors</strong>:
<ul>
<li>As capitalists, there is no need to worry about job loss due to AI development; on the contrary, they will become wealthier.</li>
<li>Start investing now to become part of the capitalist class.</li>

<li>Question: SPY and QQQ have risen for three days, will they continue to rise or fall next week?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Short-term market cannot be predicted, like flipping a coin. We invest for the long term (20+ years), focusing on long-term trends. Buy when you have money, never sell. Don&rsquo;t try to predict next week&rsquo;s market; ask the temple or the &ldquo;stock god&rdquo; in Clubhouse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing: Just started learning from the teacher&rsquo;s course two months ago, introduced by a friend in the United States. Currently in the learning stage, and has invested in some QQQ (cost between 515-530). After returning to Taiwan, considering investing in 00662. In the process of canceling previous insurance and converting individual stocks to 00662.</li>
<li>Question: Should I invest in US stocks (Firstrade account, worried about political risks in Taiwan for the child) or Taiwan stocks 00662? How to allocate at the beginning?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Recommend investing in 00662 in Taiwan, no need to use a US broker (Firstrade). It&rsquo;s better for the child to rely on themselves rather than worry about politics. When starting to learn, it is recommended to divide the total funds into three parts: 1/3 buy 00662 immediately, 1/3 buy in batches over the next 3-6 months, and 1/3 hold in cash. The ultimate goal is 70% 00662 + 30% cash. Then slowly learn whether and how to allocate leveraged funds (adjust the Beta value to 0.8-0.9).</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Who are QQQ and SPHD suitable for in terms of capital size?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: (Points out that students should watch the videos for repeated questions) This is a consideration for retirees. Need to calculate annual expenses after retirement. If 50 times the expenses equals your total assets, you can invest in QQQ (equivalent to a 2% annual withdrawal rate). If 2% is not enough, you need 3%, you may consider the S&amp;P 500. Only consider SPHD if you need even higher (~3.5-4%). Non-retirees should prioritize the high-growth QQQ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Explain Beta value. Beta=1 is synchronized with the market? Beta=1.2 is 1.2 times the volatility? Is the Beta of an 80% QQQ + 20% SGOV portfolio 0.8?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Basic understanding is correct. Beta measures the volatility of an asset relative to the market. The Beta of an 80/20 portfolio is approximately 0.8. (Reminds again that the videos explain it)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: Will the principal of SGOV (Short-Term US Treasury ETF) fall and lose money?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: The principal risk is extremely low, almost no losses (except for minor fluctuations before and after dividend payments). SGOV invests in short-term Treasury bills (T-Bills) issued by the US Treasury Department with a maturity of 0-3 months (or within one year), backed by the credit of the United States.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Joined for more than a month and reviewed the market decline in 2022 and the teacher&rsquo;s videos (especially #398 graduation episode, learned investment psychology).</li>
<li>Question 1: In January 2023 (#401), the teacher used technical indicators (50/100-day moving average crossover) to judge the market bottom and predict that 2023 would be a bull market, which was also verified afterwards. However, in later videos (#491), he emphasized not to predict market cycles and not to look at macroeconomic indicators (prosperity signals, macroeconomics, inventory cycles, etc.). Why this change? Are these indicators really useless in the long run? What was the basis for judging the bottom (just because of being optimistic about the stock market)? Should we just follow discipline and rebalance once a year?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: QQQ includes many industries (semiconductors, software, AI, biotechnology, retail such as Costco, Pepsico, Amazon, Google, Apple, etc.), and indicators for a single industry or country (such as Taiwan semiconductor economy, Taiwan prosperity signals, US prosperity signals) cannot reflect the overall index. Looking at all indicators is the same as looking at the index itself, so it is better to just focus on QQQ. The judgment in early 2023 was based on 40 years of experience (calculated that the 6-month moving average would cross upward), which is difficult to convey (&ldquo;unspeakable&rdquo;), and teaching technical analysis may cause students to misuse it and be harmed (&ldquo;go crazy&rdquo;), so it is not taught. Adhering to long-term investment discipline and holding enough cash buffer (such as 30%) is a more reliable method. Even if judging the bottom at that time, all cash would not be invested (such as still maintaining Beta 0.7), still maintaining a margin of safety. No need to take too much risk for small potential gains (referring to Buffett&rsquo;s philosophy).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: About the currency hedging of 00670L (Taiwan Leveraged QQQ ETF). Is the impact of exchange rate fluctuations significant in the long run? If the US dollar falls sharply (such as 1:13 against the Taiwan dollar), how will 00670L perform? (The teacher mentioned before that 00670L performs poorly when the US dollar rises)
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: 00670L is usually paired with 00865B (cash/short-term bonds). Exchange rate fluctuations have a hedging effect on both (when the US dollar rises, the hedging cost of 00670L increases, but the value of US dollar assets increases; the opposite is true when the US dollar falls). In the long run, exchange rate fluctuations are normal (such as the Taiwan dollar fluctuating between 28-32), but there is no fixed trend, and the expected value is zero. Currency hedging itself has a cost (wasting funds), which may not be necessary in the long run (it is recommended that fund companies consider canceling it), but the ETF is designed that way, and it does not hurt. The key is whether 00670L can achieve approximately twice the return of 00662 in the long run.</li>

<li>Sharing: Trump mentioned that 5.6 trillion in foreign investment may be invested in the United States in the future (may be exaggerated, even if halved, 2.8 trillion is also considerable), but the direction is beneficial to AI and QQQ. Observed that QQQ rebounded more strongly than SPY, DIA, and BRK recently, confirming the teacher&rsquo;s point of view (such as Katy Wood investing in AI-related companies when she saw mobile internet access). Compare the leadership styles of Chinese and American leaders (leader vs. manager) and the direction of attracting foreign investment (Saudi Arabia/Dubai vs. Myanmar/Vietnam/Malaysia).</li>
<li>Question: Please explain the difference between CIPS (Chinese RMB Cross-Border Payment System) and SWIFT. Why is CIPS faster (completed in 6 seconds)? Why does SWIFT take days? Can SWIFT be improved? Will this affect the status of the US dollar (AI replied that the two will coexist)?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: SWIFT is based on the traditional telegram transmission model (like a relay station), and information needs to be transferred through multiple layers (local bank -&gt; regional major bank -&gt; central bank -&gt; SWIFT center (Switzerland) -&gt; the other party&rsquo;s central bank -&gt; the other party&rsquo;s head office -&gt; the other party&rsquo;s branch), involving compliance checks (anti-money laundering), time difference, manual processing, etc., so it takes a long time (2+ days). CIPS is a modern real-time gross settlement system, similar to domestic payment systems in various countries, point-to-point or directly cleared through the central bank, and the speed is fast. CIPS uses RMB and is an alternative developed to deal with SWIFT being weaponized (such as sanctions against Russia), making people distrust the US dollar system. US sanctions opened a Pandora&rsquo;s box. Currently, CIPS is small (such as shipbuilding transactions between Malaysia and China), but it represents the trend of &ldquo;currency wars&rdquo; (such as Saudi Arabia and China being linked). Trump&rsquo;s visit to Saudi Arabia may be related to maintaining the status of the US dollar. Just watch the show.</li>

The latest link (showing content updated on April 26, such as 70/30 allocation recommendations) has been shared in the chat area. New links will be provided regularly (such as weekly or monthly) in the future. The teacher himself uses a more advanced personal &ldquo;Super AI&rdquo; account (possibly GPT-4o or higher, with memory function) to process and extract information, and then &ldquo;feeds&rdquo; the essence to this publicly shared GPTs version (similar to DIPS extraction).

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Because of recent trade tensions, I re-listened to the 2022 recordings. Two points are profound: 1. The biggest risk is missing the market (leaving the market). 2. Focus on long-term returns, not short-term fluctuations/shocks. The market is full of contradictory information (repeated presidential statements, pessimistic commentators) and bad news, but it often rebounds unintentionally. Friends who wait for a clear trend (such as buying after the big trend comes back) miss the rise. No one can accurately time the market. It is extremely difficult to obtain stable and high returns in the long term (such as an annualized return of 10% or more), like the sustained performance of top athletes (such as playing ball for 20 years); it is easy to have a good shot occasionally, but difficult to be stable in the long term. It is essential to stay in the market for a long time and focus on long-term growth.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Strongly agree. Investing is like a long-distance race, continuing to stay in the front (such as 3rd or 4th place) will eventually win, because the leaders often make mistakes. This is how index funds are, not the best in a single year, but leading in the long term. Need an investment horizon of 15+ years. The key to persistence is having sufficient cash reserves (especially for retirees, it is recommended to have living expenses for 15+ years) or a continuous work income.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: Started following the teacher last year, investing on my own and encouraging elders (sold insurance and invested). Recently, I have experienced a market decline and am at peace, but the elders are experiencing large fluctuations for the first time (they adopted a Beta 1.2 allocation). Through repeatedly watching videos and communicating, the elders&rsquo; confidence is still stable.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Selling a house has been tortuous: difficulty communicating with my husband (disagreed at first, had disputes), cold market (the central bank fought housing speculation in September, difficult to get loans), price reduction (applied the teacher&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;there is no house that cannot be sold, only a price that cannot be sold&rdquo;) to complete the sale (in February this year). The process was painful (communication, management, market changes, funds stuck, high taxes), and I learned a lesson that I don&rsquo;t want to experience again.</li>
<li>Sharing 3: Currently, half of the investment portfolio is QQQ-like, half is TSMC, and there is also a mortgage line of credit (financial mortgage). My husband wants to use this line of credit to increase positions when the market falls (TSMC?), but hesitates and is afraid in the middle of the actual fall (soft-handed, unable to do it). This decline allowed him to experience his true risk tolerance. My husband did not accept the full QQQ allocation before, but now he has some experience. It verifies the stability of the teacher&rsquo;s asset allocation method.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Appreciate Monmon&rsquo;s peaceful state of mind (a good quality for investors, &ldquo;destiny&rdquo; + &ldquo;luck&rdquo; to meet the teacher). Communicating with family requires patience (it is a 15-30 year undertaking, no rush). The funds from the financial mortgage should be invested as soon as possible (such as 00662), buy blindly, and don&rsquo;t time the market. When investing, consider the overall asset allocation, include the loan amount in the total asset calculation, and ensure that the total Beta value is within the desired range (such as about 0.7, that is, maintaining an overall ratio of about 70/30), rather than investing all the borrowed money in high-risk assets. It is recommended to keep at least 30% cash (can be 4:1:5 or 5:1:4, Beta 0.6 or 0.7). This decline is a touchstone for risk tolerance, proving the necessity of conservative allocation. Even if young and have a job, 30% cash is also recommended.</li>

<li>Sharing: The situation is similar to Monmon&rsquo;s. Both myself and the elders invested in 00662/00670L, using Beta 1.2 (4:4:2, that is, 40% 00662, 40% 00670L, 20% cash/00865B) allocation. I can bear the recent fluctuations (the government is quite amazing), but I am not sure whether the elders (who have not watched YouTube, have no financial common sense, but believe and invest) can bear greater future declines (such as 40-80%). Continuously accompany the elders and give them confidence. The elders have a good mentality so far.</li>
<li>Question: If I want to reduce the Beta for the elders, when and how should I operate?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: It is generally recommended now that the Beta should not exceed 1.0 (such as 70/30). For an existing allocation of 1.2, it is recommended to evaluate it at the end of each year: if the market rises (such as 00662 returning to the level at the beginning of the year or higher), you can sell part of the leveraged position (00670L) and transfer the funds to cash (00865B), so that the cash ratio is adjusted to 30% or higher. If the market is down at the end of the year, then do not move. The goal is to gradually reduce the Beta to below 1.0. Before that, there is no need to consider complicated rebalancing strategies. Don&rsquo;t operate too frequently (once a year) to avoid increasing the elders&rsquo; anxiety (they may secretly look at the APP).</li>

<li>Question 1: Investing in QQQ in Canada, the teacher recommends QQC, etc., and mentions avoiding Hedged funds? It seems that most Canadian versions are Hedged? Which one should I choose? (Previously confused HXQ/HSQ).
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Recommend HXQ.t because it does not pay dividends, making tax treatment simpler. If you already hold QQC.to or ZQQ, there is no need to sell it, and new investments can be bought in HXQ.t. It is also acceptable if only Hedged versions are available locally.</li>

<li>Question 2: Please explain the asset allocation ratio (such as 70/30, 4:4:2). Time is limited (working, back problems requiring exercise, blood sugar problems), it is difficult to find specific content in videos, and listening to Clubhouse is also time-consuming.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: (Emphasizing the importance of learning, earning money from work only accounts for a small part of a lifetime of wealth, so you should spend time learning about investment) For ordinary investors working in Canada, the simplest allocation is: 70% HXQ.t + 30% cash/money market fund (Money Market). Check and adjust annually (sell the ones that have risen more to supplement cash, or use cash to buy the ones that have fallen more) to maintain this ratio.</li>
<li>(Nibalao Supplement): Canadian local stock dividends have tax advantages, while US-sourced dividends (such as QQC) are taxed (I don&rsquo;t know how much, but higher than Canadian stock taxes). I agree with the teacher&rsquo;s point of view: focus on investment returns is higher than focusing on work.</li>

<li>Sharing: Detailed comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin/cryptocurrencies and QQQ, based on his personal experience in the blockchain industry (entered the industry in 2017, experienced the blockchain/cryptocurrency community, ICO explosion, 2018 bear market):
<ul>
<li>Storage Security: BTC requires self-management of private keys/hardware wallets (cold wallets), which are easy to lose or damage, high risk; QQQ is托管ed by brokers, which is safe.</li>
<li>Transaction Security: BTC is vulnerable to hacker attacks, phishing, and platform crashes; QQQ is protected by regulations.</li>
<li>Staking/Liquidity: BTC lacks standardized and safe staking channels (DeFi is high risk); QQQ can be easily staked and borrowed (pledged) through brokers without selling.</li>
<li>Taxes: Selling BTC requires capital gains tax; holding QQQ for a long time and using pledges can avoid/defer taxes.</li>
<li>Legality: BTC has legal risks in China (trading and mining are illegal), and cashing out may be frozen; QQQ (and QDII 513100/513300) are legal and compliant.</li>
<li>Volatility/Risk: BTC is extremely volatile (short-term drops of 50-80% are common, such as an 85% drop in 2018), and ordinary people cannot withstand the mental stress; QQQ has a much lower frequency of large fluctuations.</li>
<li>Liquidity: The actual circulating volume of BTC is limited (locked by large holders, lost coins), which is not as high as the global liquidity of QQQ.</li>
<li>Practicality: Not detailed.</li>
<li>Future Returns: BTC has a high market value (nearly 2 trillion US dollars, comparable to top technology companies), and the possibility of super high multiple growth in the future is reduced (even if it rises to 200,000 US dollars/coin, it is only 2-3 times), and the rate of return may tend to be stable, lower than QQQ.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Cryptocurrencies are &ldquo;demons and ghosts,&rdquo; not suitable for ordinary investors, highly tempting but extremely risky.</li>

<li>James&rsquo; Comment: Completely agree, cryptocurrencies should not be touched. Shared cases of others losing huge amounts of Bitcoin (equivalent to 15 million US dollars) due to unfamiliarity with cross-chain transfer rules (such as transferring between different chains or exchanges that do not support the target chain), emphasizing its complexity and risk (may be a technical problem or fraud).</li>

<li><strong>File Access</strong>: In areas with limited Google service, you can download the files and open them with local software (such as Excel).</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The market is always fluctuating, the constant in the market is fluctuation, so fluctuation is certain to happen in the market, so you don&rsquo;t need to analyze where the fluctuation comes from&hellip; You see everyone talking so eloquently, in fact, he doesn&rsquo;t even know what he is talking about&hellip;
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: James emphasized the normality and unpredictability of market fluctuations, advising investors not to waste time analyzing the causes of short-term fluctuations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investment is buying with the intention of never selling, this is investment. Buying with the intention of selling at a high point is called speculation.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: James clearly distinguished the core criteria of investment and speculation: whether the purpose is to hold for the long term.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Making a decision about all investment and financial life is very simple, which is long-term, simple and effective&hellip; Convenience is a value. No trouble is a value.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: When comparing 00864B and 00865B, James emphasized that choosing an investment method that is simpler and less troublesome in the long run has value in itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to risk the money you need for the money you don&rsquo;t need.
&ndash; James (quoting/paraphrasing Buffett&rsquo;s idea)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: Explained why even if it is judged that the market may rise, you should keep enough cash buffer (the money you need) and should not take too much risk for additional, potentially unnecessary returns (the money you don&rsquo;t need).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Later you will find that when humans develop to the extreme, food, clothing, housing, and transportation are all free, all free&hellip; Then what does it mean to be alive?&hellip; But what is the meaning of a dog? This may be the question that the last 80% of people have to think about.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: When fantasizing about the future when AI is extremely developed, James raised the question of the profound crisis of existential meaning that humans (especially the majority who do not need to work) will face after material needs are completely satisfied.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest risk comes from [missing] the market&hellip; Focus on long-term returns, not this short-term [fluctuation].
&ndash; Yao</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: Sharing the profound experience after reviewing the teacher&rsquo;s teachings when the market information is chaotic, emphasizing the importance of being in the market for a long time and focusing on long-term goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to be the first every time, we only want to be the third or fourth every time&hellip; Over the long term, we will be the first.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: Using the analogy of racing to explain the logic of index investing: not pursuing short-term leadership, relying on continuous and steady performance, and ultimately winning in the long cycle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no house that cannot be sold, only a price that cannot be sold.
&ndash; Monmon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: Sharing the experience of selling a house, mentioning that applying this point of view ultimately successfully sold the property.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should put your focus on investing, and the return is definitely much higher than if you put your focus on working.
&ndash; Nibalao</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: When discussing that students do not have time to learn about investment, this student emphasized that based on their own experience, the long-term return of putting energy into investment learning far exceeds that of putting it into work itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Cryptocurrencies] are one of the demons and ghosts&hellip; The future return of Bitcoin may tend to be stable, and the teacher also mentioned this issue before.
&ndash; Jason</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: Based on industry experience and risk analysis, the student qualified cryptocurrencies as a high-risk category unsuitable for ordinary investors, and pointed out that its future return may not be as good as index funds.</p>

<p>This Clubhouse episode was rich and insightful, ranging from the macro market philosophy (fluctuation is normal, long-term perspective, optimistic mentality), AI&rsquo;s disruptive vision of the future (productivity, social structure, meaning of life), to the micro investment practice (ETF selection such as 00865B vs 00864B, Canadian HXQ.t, asset allocation principles such as 70/30, Beta management, risk awareness), all detailed explanations and discussions were provided. The core information is still focused on: adhering to long-term holding of high-quality index funds (especially the Nasdaq 100), understanding and accepting market fluctuations, maintaining rationality and patience, using time compounding, and conducting sound asset allocation according to personal risk tolerance (emphasizing the importance of at least 30% cash), and being vigilant about market noise and high-risk speculative products (such as cryptocurrencies). The Q&amp;A session answered in detail the specific questions encountered by students in different countries, different stages, and different product selections, and emphasized the importance of continuous learning of investment knowledge. Finally, it was reminded again that the Clubhouse will be suspended for the next two weeks.</p>

<p>This episode focuses on the mindset and strategies that investors should adopt in the context of current market volatility and volatile international situations. James emphasizes that for long-term investors, short-term market fluctuations, macroeconomic conditions, and even wars should not be of excessive concern. The core strategy should be to insist on buying high-quality index funds (such as Nasdaq 100 QQQ) and holding them for the long term, never selling. At the same time, he shares an updated Excel financial simulation tool, discusses pre-retirement withdrawal strategies, leverage management, the significant advantages of early Roth conversion, and how to build a strong investment psychology to cope with external pressure and complex information.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore the Noise, Keep Buying:</strong> Macro factors such as market volatility, international situations, tariff wars, trade wars, hot wars, and cold wars have little to do with long-term investing. Investors cannot and do not need to predict or respond to them. Just keep buying index funds (QQQ) and holding them for the long term.</li>
<li><strong>Halving is Inevitable:</strong> In the long-term investment process, a 50% or even greater reduction in assets is an inevitable event, not a matter of probability, but a certainty. Investors need to be psychologically prepared and ensure that they can still &ldquo;survive&rdquo; in this situation. Ask yourself every day: &ldquo;If the market halves again, can I still hold on?&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Long-Termism and Optimistic Mindset:</strong> Investing requires patience, and wealth is worth waiting for. The market always goes up in the long run. Investors should always be extremely optimistic, even if the market drops 80%, because the decline is part of the investment process, and the future is always bright. Buying is for future gains, not for leaving the market out of fear of future declines.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Origin and Background of the Problem:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some students reported problems with the old Excel version: 1) Increasing the spending ratio may actually reduce the final assets; 2) After a significant increase in assets (such as from 1 million to 4 million), spending directly at 2% of the new assets (i.e., 80,000) failed the stress test when simulating the 2000 tech bubble burst.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Main Updates and Usage Suggestions:</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Separating Spending and Rebalancing Ratios:</strong> Corrected the error of linking the spending ratio with the smart rebalancing ratio. The new version allows independent settings. It is recommended that the smart rebalancing ratio remain at 2% or be adjusted according to individual risk tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>New Strategy for Increasing Spending After Asset Growth (0.8% Rule):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simulation Conclusion:</strong> If assets increase significantly (such as from 1 million to 4.6 million, net worth 3.8 million, and borrowing 780,000 accounting for 17% of total assets), spending directly at 2% of the new assets (80,000/year) is too risky.</li>
<li><strong>Safety Recommendation:</strong> When assets have increased by more than <strong>2.5 times</strong> and the pledged loan ratio is controlled within <strong>20%</strong>, consider increasing the annual spending to <strong>0.7% or 0.8% of the new total assets</strong>. For example, assets of 4.6 million can spend about 36,800/year (4.6 million * 0.8%). After this adjustment, even if you encounter a market shock similar to 2000, you can maintain a sufficient margin of safety. This means that if assets grow 2.5 times, the annual spending can safely increase by about 2.2 times.</li>
<li><strong>Operation Guide (Using the &ldquo;Practice Version&rdquo; Excel):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Enter &ldquo;Scenario Nine&rdquo; (applicable to situations where you have started pledged borrowing and spending).</li>
<li>Modify the &ldquo;Amount Already Borrowed&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo; or &ldquo;Scenario Eight Nine Information&rdquo; area in the front of the table (<strong>do not directly change the S2 cell inside Excel, go to the overview page in front to change it</strong>).</li>
<li>Return to the scenario nine simulation page and modify the initial asset allocation ratio (such as QQQ 33%, QLD/Leverage 45%, Cash 22%).</li>
<li>Adjust the &ldquo;Borrowing Expenses&rdquo; percentage (located in column T, such as changing to 0.8 or 0.7).</li>
<li>Adjust the &ldquo;Borrowing Interest&rdquo; according to the actual situation (cell S5, such as setting it to 3% for Taiwan).</li>
<li>Observe the &ldquo;Minimum Maintenance Rate&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Minimum Equity Ratio&rdquo;) in the results and ensure that it is higher than your set safety threshold (such as 150% or 160%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cash Interest Assumption:</strong> When calculating the compound interest on the Cash portion in Excel, the interest rate used is half of the borrowing rate (S5) (i.e., <code>S5/2/12</code> calculated monthly). This is based on the conservative assumption that the deposit rate is usually lower than the borrowing rate and does not need to be modified.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Version Description:</strong> Provides &ldquo;Easy Version&rdquo; (only needs to fill in the initial total assets, smart rebalancing %, and annual spending %) and &ldquo;Practice Version&rdquo; (allows you to modify more detailed parameters inside Excel, such as initial allocation ratio, profit transfer ratio, initial borrowing ratio/amount, withholding cash ratio, etc.). To perform detailed simulations and parameter adjustments, you need to use the &ldquo;Practice Version.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario Analysis:</strong> Compare a couple aged 50 with 2 million in Traditional IRA, expected return of 14%, and tax rate of 24%, under three different Roth conversion strategies for the long term (to age 100).
<ul>
<li>Scenario 1: No conversion, relying on RMD. The final assets are approximately <strong>330 million</strong>.</li>
<li>Scenario 2: Work until age 56 and then start converting. The final assets are approximately <strong>350 million</strong>.</li>
<li>Scenario 3: Retire immediately at age 50 and start converting. The final assets are as high as <strong>780 million</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Core Conclusion:</strong> Retiring 6 years early to perform Roth conversion, utilizing the low tax bracket window in the early stage of retirement, can bring more than <strong>300 million USD</strong> in additional wealth. Even for high-income earners (assuming a conversion tax rate of 40%), it takes an additional 9-10 years of work to make up for the huge opportunity cost of not converting early. <strong>It is strongly recommended that those who meet the conditions plan and execute Roth conversion as soon as possible.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Make Good Use of Financial Tools (Transmissive Power):</strong> Specifically pointed out that Taiwan&rsquo;s low interest rate environment provides investors with favorable conditions to use borrowing (pledged loans, etc.) to amplify investment returns (transmissive power).</li>
<li><strong>Bank Perspective and Customer Relationships:</strong> Banks view deposits as liabilities and loans as assets. They are happy to see customers borrow and pay interest on time. Large borrowing customers are VIPs of the bank and enjoy preferential treatment; ordinary depositors need to go through regular procedures.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth Circulation Mechanism:</strong> Commercial banks play an intermediary role in the capitalist system, transferring the idle funds (deposits) of risk-averse/non-investors to investors (borrowers) who are willing to take risks and know how to use funds, and earn interest spreads from them. Understanding this mechanism helps investors use leverage more confidently.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Coping with External Pressure:</strong> When facing the worries or doubts of family and friends when the market falls, you need to build a strong inner self:
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Belief:</strong> First of all, you must be firm in your investment philosophy and understand that volatility is a normal process.</li>
<li><strong>Shielding and Transcendence:</strong> Practice from the realm of &ldquo;not listening, not seeing, does not exist&rdquo; to &ldquo;both seeing and listening but also does not exist,&rdquo; that is, the inner self is not disturbed by external words.</li>
<li><strong>Positive Attitude:</strong> Show confidence and a good state to the outside world (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, no problem, the market will rise&rdquo;).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decluttering and Value Ordering (Refer to Video 00351 &ldquo;Enlightenment&rdquo;):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Life should be simplified, and clarifying what you &ldquo;don&rsquo;t want&rdquo; is more important than what you &ldquo;want.&rdquo; Reducing unnecessary material pursuits and social relationships can bring more freedom and focus.</li>
<li>Reflect on the core values of life, such as &ldquo;relationships,&rdquo; &ldquo;sense of contribution,&rdquo; &ldquo;health,&rdquo; and &ldquo;soul&rdquo; shared by students, and work is only a part of it.</li>
<li>Get rid of the shackles of seeking external recognition (refer to &ldquo;The Courage to be Disliked&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Love and responsibility for children are the fundamental values that many people find difficult to give up.</li>

<li><strong>Beware of Information Cocoons (Refer to Video 00420 Logic Class):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Realize that we may all be trapped in &ldquo;information cocoons&rdquo; by network algorithms, only accessing homogeneous information, resulting in a narrow vision and loss of independent thinking ability, like &ldquo;parrots&rdquo; repeating views.</li>
<li>Actively seek different information sources, use <strong>critical thinking</strong>, especially the ability to <strong>falsify</strong>, and maintain skepticism about the information received (first assume that 99% is wrong).</li>

<li><strong>Share:</strong> Taiwanese firefighter, 40 years old, new investor (started in February), adopting a 442 allocation (40% QQQ, 40% leverage, 20% cash), investing approximately 6 million. Recently experienced a large single-day drop of 28% in the leveraged portion, but stated that they could withstand it. Few friends shared the same philosophy.

<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comments:</strong> Thank you for sharing. The 442 allocation is more aggressive, and this decline is a good stress test. Reminded that firefighting work is physically demanding, and investment should focus more on stability. Suggested adjusting the allocation according to their own comfort level, such as 433 or more conservative 424 or even 505. The primary goal of asset allocation is to make yourself &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; and able to hold it for the long term. Cash is the key to &ldquo;surviving.&rdquo; When facing external doubts, maintaining a strong inner self and confidence is the most important.</li>

<li><strong>Life Reflections:</strong> Reviewing last week&rsquo;s homework, combined with &ldquo;How Will You Measure Your Life?&rdquo; and Brian Dyson&rsquo;s five-ball theory, clarified that the second value of life is &ldquo;relationships,&rdquo; &ldquo;sense of contribution,&rdquo; and &ldquo;treating nature well&rdquo;; emphasized the irreplaceability of health, family, friendship, and soul; the current most wanted to get rid of is &ldquo;seeking recognition from others&rdquo;; believed that life regrets often stem from &ldquo;things not done.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Origin of Excel Questions:</strong> Deeply studied Excel and discovered problems due to concerns about smart rebalancing causing Beta to continue to rise (such as &gt;1.2) and wanting to increase living expenses (at 2% of new assets) after asset growth.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Can leveraged ETFs (such as 00670L) commonly used by Taiwanese investors be included in the Excel model to calculate the maintenance rate (market value)? If included, even with a higher Beta (such as 1.24), it seems that a 433 allocation can pass the test.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Philosophy of Life:</strong> Appreciated the in-depth thinking. Emphasized the importance of &ldquo;decluttering&rdquo; and clarifying &ldquo;what not to want.&rdquo; Agreed that there is no need for others to recognize, and shared that they value their relationship with their children the most. Recommended video 00351 &ldquo;Enlightenment.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Excel and Taiwan Applications:</strong> Theoretically, the market value of leveraged ETFs can be included in the maintenance rate calculation. The existing model is based on the US situation and is conservative (high interest rate assumptions, not explicitly including the market value of leverage), aimed at being universal and safe. Taiwanese investors can take advantage of the no capital gains tax (easy to reduce leverage) and lower interest rates, and modify Excel themselves (such as changing the interest rate and adjusting the maintenance rate formula) to better fit reality. If the model can pass, it is usually easier in Taiwan. Thanked them for their question, which prompted the optimization of the &ldquo;how to increase spending after asset growth&rdquo; strategy (0.7%-0.8% rule or reducing leverage).</li>

<li><strong>Question:</strong> Observed that the recovery time of historical bear markets seems to be shortening. Combined with the evolution of US financial policies (QE, pandemic response, etc.), does it mean that the government&rsquo;s control efficiency has improved and the market recovery is accelerating?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Agreed with the observation. With the accumulation of financial theory and practical experience, policy tools are more effective, and the ability to respond to known crises has indeed increased, shortening the recovery period. But the real risk lies in <strong>unknown, unprecedented crises</strong>. There is no need to worry too much about known patterns, and be optimistic about the future but have risk awareness.</li>

<li><strong>Share:</strong> 433 allocation is already All in. Although they thought they were prepared, when actually facing the decline, it was difficult to bear the pressure from their parents&rsquo; &ldquo;caring&rdquo; worries, and they were even afraid to tell them about the losses. Glad that this decline occurred when the invested proportion was not yet high.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How to cope with this kind of caring pressure from relatives and friends (especially parents)? (Especially for office workers who cannot physically avoid it like retirees).
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Cannot control others, only cultivate the inner self. From shielding information (&ldquo;not listening, not seeing, does not exist&rdquo;) to the inner self not being disturbed (&ldquo;both seeing and listening but also does not exist&rdquo;). The key is to have firm self-belief, understand the current situation, and show confidence to the outside world (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine&rdquo;). The decline is the norm for investing, or a good opportunity to rebalance. When the inner self is strong enough to realize a certain illusion of the external world, its influence can be reduced.</li>

<li><strong>Question:</strong> Expressed concerns about the US&rsquo;s leading position in technology, listed multiple negative information (loss of scientists, tightening of visas, damage to funding/independence of research institutions, anti-vaccine stance of the Minister of Health and public health incidents), and asked about the impact of the US losing its position as a technology center on QQQ investment and whether it is necessary to adjust the strategy.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Macro Level:</strong> Refer to video 00430C. Admitted that global competition is intensifying, but the US has not declined, and the foundation of technological strength remains. The US democratic system has resilience and self-correcting ability, and there is no need to be overly pessimistic due to short-term policies or personnel changes.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Indicators:</strong> The criteria for judgment is the composition of the top ten technology companies in the world by market value. If it is still dominated by the United States, then there is no need to change the strategy. If the future pattern changes significantly (such as non-US companies accounting for more than half), consider adjusting the proportion accordingly. Unlikely to happen within 50 years.</li>
<li><strong>Specific Concerns:</strong> Much information may be amplified or biased (information cocoon effect). Believe in the basic integrity system and institutional resilience of American society. Individual incidents (such as anti-vaccine rhetoric, measles outbreaks), while worrying, are unlikely to subvert the entire system. Stay focused, but don&rsquo;t panic, and focus on verifiable facts.</li>

<li><strong>Question:</strong> Why is the annual borrowing rate (S5) divided by 2 in the monthly compound interest calculation of the cash portion in the Excel practice version?
<ul>
<li><strong>James/慶 (Qing) Response:</strong> This is the design assumption of the model: The <strong>deposit rate</strong> (cash yield) is set to half of the <strong>borrowing rate</strong>. This is a simplified, conservative estimate that reflects the reality of the bank&rsquo;s deposit and loan interest rate spread. The formula <code>principal * (1 + S5/2/12)</code> is correct, reflecting this safety margin, and does not need to be modified.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Market volatility, international situations, trade wars, hot and cold wars&hellip; have nothing to do with our investment, just buy, don&rsquo;t sell. Long-term is investment.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Emphasizes that long-term investment should focus on holding high-quality assets, ignoring short-term market noise and macro events.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will definitely encounter several opportunities for asset depreciation of 50% in the market, this is not a probability problem, this is a certainty.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Reminds investors that a significant market correction is an inevitable part of long-term investment and that they need to be psychologically and financially prepared for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asset allocation is not done for performance, asset allocation is done for your comfort.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Explains that the primary goal of asset allocation (especially the proportion of cash holdings) is to ensure that investors can hold it with peace of mind and get through the cycle, rather than simply pursuing the highest returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commercial banks are intermediaries that transfer the money of the poor to the rich for use, and this revolving door takes place in banks. This is the reason why the capitalist system makes the poor poorer and the rich richer.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Reveals the core role of the modern banking system in capital flow and its impact on the wealth distribution pattern.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who borrow money are VIPs&hellip; those who don&rsquo;t have much money and don&rsquo;t borrow money, please go to the counter to draw a number and line up.
&ndash; James (quoting student Benson&rsquo;s observation)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Vividly compares the vast difference in the way banks treat large borrowing customers and ordinary depositors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You push out all the things you don&rsquo;t want first&hellip; then what are the things you have left that you want? It&rsquo;s very little&hellip; the less you want, the less homework you have.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Applies the concept of &ldquo;decluttering&rdquo; to life planning, advocating that by reducing desires and unnecessary pursuits, inner freedom and focus can be achieved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are besieged by the network and locked in an information prison, you can&rsquo;t break out&hellip; all our thoughts are not our thoughts&hellip; we are all parrots.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Deeply warns of the erosion of individual cognition and independent thinking ability by &ldquo;information cocoons,&rdquo; calling for vigilance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both seeing and listening but also does not exist.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Describes an advanced state of psychological practice, where even when exposed to negative or disturbing information, the inner self can remain calm and unaffected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things that have happened in the past are less worried about, we are worried about things that have never happened before.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Distinguishes between known and unknown risks, pointing out that historical experience helps to deal with recurring crises, but the real challenge lies in dealing with new, unknown shocks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you retire six years early (to perform Roth conversion), you will be short of 300 million (USD).
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Based on simulation calculation results, strongly emphasizes the huge long-term wealth effect that can be brought about by using the low tax rate window to convert Roth IRA/401k as early as possible.</p>

<p>This lecture, against the background of increased market volatility, strengthened the core concept of long-term investment: ignore the noise and insist on holding high-quality index funds (QQQ). James not only updated and explained in detail the important financial planning tool Excel model (especially the adjustment of withdrawal strategies after asset growth), but also persuasively demonstrated the amazing value of doing Roth conversion as early as possible. At a deeper level, the course focused on the construction of investment psychology, discussed how to understand and use financial system rules, how to cope with external pressure (worries from relatives and friends, social information) with a strong inner self, and especially emphasized the extreme importance of maintaining independent thinking and being wary of &ldquo;information cocoons&rdquo; in the era of information explosion. The ultimate goal is to help investors cultivate both their inner skills and achieve a double improvement in cognition and mindset on the road to pursuing financial freedom.</p>

      <description>In this episode, James emphasizes that in any market environment, the primary consideration for investing is having sufficient cash reserves, followed by holding index funds for the long term. He discusses risk tolerance, asset allocation models (such as 433 and 424), the principles for using leveraged funds, and caution regarding paid groups and conflicts of interest. Students share their experiences and questions regarding market volatility, tax planning, retirement preparation, and more.</description>

<p>The core viewpoint of this episode emphasizes that investment decisions should be <strong>independent of market volatility</strong>, with <strong>sufficient cash reserves</strong> serving as the first step and cornerstone of investment planning. After determining the cash level based on individual risk tolerance and living needs, then proceed with long-term (15+ years) investment in index funds (especially the Nasdaq 100). Beta is a result of asset allocation, not the starting point. At the same time, be wary of various risks in investment, especially cognitive risks and behavioral biases, and remain vigilant about conflicts of interest in financial services.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on Doing the Right Things:</strong> The core is &ldquo;Han Xin Counts Soldiers&rdquo; (i.e., using affordable and safe borrowing, such as mortgages and credit lines, for investment), putting borrowed money into the market, but with sufficient cash reserves.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Targets:</strong> Only invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (such as QQQ, 00662, 513100, etc.), as it represents human growth and innovation and has a self-evolving mechanism of survival of the fittest. Related materials are linked on page 10 of the handout. It is mentioned that HXQ and other Nasdaq 100-based funds may outperform QQQ in certain periods.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Holding:</strong> Holding for 15+ years after purchase is key, &ldquo;never selling.&rdquo; Only inaction can lead to wealth, not frequent trading.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Optimistic:</strong> Investment is based on confidence in the long-term development of humanity.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Question:</strong> The first step in investing is not what to buy, but <strong>how much cash needs to be retained</strong> to live securely and cope with emergencies. This is the most important thing.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Needs Determine Allocation:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Young People:</strong> First, prepare an emergency fund (e.g., NT$400,000/CNY100,000), and only invest surplus funds.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation Model Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>433 (Beta 1.0):</strong> 40% Index + 30% Leverage + 30% Cash. Requires 30% Cash &gt; Emergency Fund (e.g., NT$400,000), requiring total assets of NT$1.33 million to implement.</li>
<li><strong>424 (Beta 0.8):</strong> 40% Index + 20% Leverage + 40% Cash. Requires 40% Cash &gt; Emergency Fund (e.g., NT$400,000), requiring total assets of NT$1 million to implement. Illustrates that reducing Beta can lower the funding threshold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>High-Net-Worth Individuals:</strong> The principle is the same, determine the cash ratio according to personal comfort (potentially millions of RMB or hundreds of thousands of USD).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Beta is the Result, Not the Goal:</strong> First determine cash needs and risk tolerance, naturally forming the allocation ratio, and finally calculate the Beta value as a measurement tool. Don&rsquo;t set a target Beta from the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Allocation Irrelevant Factors:</strong> Asset allocation is <strong>unrelated</strong> to age, fund size, or market level, only related to how to prevent accidents and how much accident can be tolerated.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Tolerance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Young people have less experience, so risk tolerance may not be high, and should not blindly pursue high Beta (e.g., 442).</li>
<li>Wealthy people are usually more conservative, pursuing stability rather than extreme returns (Beta 0.5 may be sufficient).</li>
<li>Conclusion: Taking risks beyond your tolerance is foolish. Investment is like eating spicy food, do what you can handle.</li>
<li>Recommendation: Start conservatively. If you believe you can tolerate Beta 1.2, start with 1.0; if you believe you can tolerate 1.0, start with 0.8.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Leveraged Fund Usage Principles:</strong> The ratio of leveraged funds should not exceed the ratio of cash or the ratio of the original fund. This suggests that a 442 allocation (40% Index + 40% Leverage + 20% Cash) is not suitable for most people.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral Biases:</strong> Retail investors often feel sad when the market falls (regret buying early) and also sad when the market rises (regret not going all-in). The correct allocation should achieve &ldquo;happy when it rises, comfortable when it falls,&rdquo; maintaining &ldquo;immovability.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Individual Stock Risk:</strong> No company lasts forever (examples: Intel, Kodak, Blackberry), individual stock risk is high. Index funds mitigate individual stock risk through a mechanism of survival of the fittest.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing Risk:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safe Borrowing:</strong> Mortgages, credit lines (Han Xin Counts Soldiers), assuming income can cover monthly payments, unrelated to market fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Dangerous Borrowing:</strong> Margin trading, stock-pledged reinvestment. Market declines can lead to forced liquidation or even bankruptcy. <strong>These operations are strictly prohibited.</strong></li>
<li>James&rsquo;s pledge loan: Based on holding cash far exceeding debt, ensuring absolute security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Specific Funds Use Risk:</strong> Money earmarked for short-term use (e.g., down payment on a house) within a short period (e.g., 3 years) <strong>absolutely cannot</strong> be invested in the stock market. Someone recently defaulted because of this.</li>
<li><strong>Tax Risk:</strong> Tax planning is very important and can affect significant wealth. Rules need to be carefully studied (e.g., the application of the U.S. Wash Sale Rule across accounts).</li>
<li><strong>Spending Ability Mindset:</strong> True &ldquo;affordability&rdquo; means being able to easily repurchase an item if it breaks down, as in James&rsquo;s example of replacing a juicer. Large expenditures (e.g., buying a house) should also have this mindset, otherwise the risk is too high.</li>

<ol>
<li>Observed that regardless of wealth, some people are keen on short-term trading, possibly due to addictive pleasure or a sense of accomplishment. Poor people may say they need quick returns, while rich people may enjoy the process.</li>
<li>Emphasized the strict prohibition of margin trading or stock-pledged reinvestment. Recently, with the market decline, someone was forced to liquidate and even became indebted because of it. Compared this to his own use of credit lines/mortgages for investment, stating that as long as he can afford the monthly payments, the market decline does not affect his survival.</li>
<li>Mentioned a senior who was forced to liquidate due to margin calls during the Kuo Wan-Jung incident (Taiwan stock market historical event) and has been in debt ever since, warning future generations.</li>

<li>Has reached the retirement goal (50x annual expenses), but his current salary is equivalent to 6% of total assets. He hopes for a higher retirement replacement rate in the future (assets need to increase by another 2-3 times). Between 433 (30% cash + 2% withdrawal) and 442 (20% cash + no withdrawal), how to further think about the choice from the perspective of safety and applicability?</li>
<li>(Implicit question) Should he continue working for a sense of accomplishment, or retire early?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Regarding Purchasing the Car:</strong> Praised his use of &ldquo;non-own funds&rdquo; for consumption, pointing out that being able to borrow money is itself a manifestation of wealth, the key is controllable risk (sufficient cash).</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Retirement Choices:</strong> This is a classic question. Cited another case to illustrate that early retirement may bring huge benefits due to tax planning (such as Roth conversions). Suggested that Rui reflect: if work had no salary or recognition, would he still want to go? The value of work may change with stage, and there may be new pursuits in the future. Looking back from age 90, would he regret working several more decades? With financial freedom, the work mentality can be more relaxed.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding 433 vs 442 Safety:</strong> Assuming the market goes to zero, which is safer? The answer is the one with a higher cash ratio (433 has 30% cash, 442 has only 20%).</li>

<li>Question: Regarding whether the interest on the U.S. Pledged Asset Line (PAL, pledge loan) can be tax-deductible, and how to operate? Feels that the rules are complex and there are many restrictions.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: The money borrowed from PAL is mainly used for consumption, not reinvestment. The issue of interest tax deduction is complicated and may require adjusting the type of capital gains (e.g., converting long-term to short-term), relying on accountant operations. James himself does not pay attention to this operation because his strategy is to hold a lot of cash, making interest income far exceed PAL interest expenses, and PAL interest is close to zero. The more fundamental strategy is to achieve &ldquo;zero income, zero capital gains,&rdquo; so there is no need to consider tax deduction.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Revealed an American tax trap: the Wash Sale Rule may apply to all accounts (including 401k/IRA and other retirement accounts). If you sell a loss-making asset (such as QQQ) in a taxable account for Tax Loss Harvesting (TLH) and automatically buy a similar asset (such as an SP500 index fund) in a retirement account at the same time, the loss in the taxable account may be permanently disallowed (because retirement accounts are taxed at ordinary income rates when withdrawn, with no capital gains concept). This is especially important for high-tech employees, as they often hold a large number of RSUs and perform TLH.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: Tax issues are extremely important. Pointed out that TLH itself also has risks, such as the market rebounding after selling, making it impossible to buy back the original asset (QQQ) at an ideal price, or generating new capital gains when buying back. If James himself has no need (such as no capital gains without selling stocks), he tends to let the loss carry forward and deduct $3,000 of ordinary income each year, rather than use it to offset capital gains. However, for Julia, who needs to offset a large amount of RSU capital gains, TLH is a reasonable strategy and needs to be operated carefully. Discussed the problem of high tax rates in California. Re-emphasized the ultimate goal of pursuing a zero-tax state, and the value of tax planning far exceeds the salary itself.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: Asked about the risk of the Pacific War two years ago, at that time the teacher suggested reducing 50% of QQQ. Now that he has adopted the strategy of holding a large amount of cash (such as 433/424), can he withstand this type of risk, insist on holding it and rebalancing at the end of the year, without selling in the middle?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: The evolution of the strategy is because the introduction of leveraged instruments allows holding a large amount of cash more effectively. The core risk management issue is not specific events (wars, disasters, etc.), but <strong>whether it is possible to survive in extreme market conditions (such as closure/deep decline for 10-15 years)</strong>. If cash reserves are sufficient to support such a long time, there is no need to make predictive operations for specific events. Comparing risks: for young people, the risk of carrying a mortgage and facing unemployment + market decline may be more realistic and fatal than the risk of war. Buying a house should be as easy and stress-free as buying slippers to be considered affordable.</li>

<li>Sharing: Summarized two major investment risks:
<ol>
<li><strong>Choosing the wrong asset:</strong> The market is full of various temptations, choosing a high-quality asset for the long term (such as QQQ) is the foundation. Thanks to the teacher for continuing to emphasize this.</li>
<li><strong>Missing the upside:</strong> Statistics show that missing the 10 days with the biggest market gains (in the past 20 years) will cut total returns in half. These big rally days often occur during periods of extreme panic (such as 2008, 2020). This confirms the importance of the &ldquo;never sell&rdquo; strategy to avoid timing the market.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: Highly Agreed. Defined <strong>the real, permanent loss</strong> as <strong>the returns that should have been earned but were not</strong> (such as missing a 12% rally). Book losses caused by market declines are temporary and will recover. Compared buying QQQ at a high point (540) with buying at a low point (440), the difference in annualized returns after holding for 40 years is extremely small (11.98% vs 12.5%), indicating that the timing of the purchase is not important, but long-term holding is key. Use a long-term perspective (40 years later) to review current decisions.</li>

<li>Question: Approaching retirement, but savings have not reached the 30-50x target. There is a stable high income in the next 5 years, and Pension/Social Security will cover most expenses after retirement. Does not use pledging due to concerns about risk. Can I not retain 20% cash and take a 100% stock holding strategy, relying on future income, emergency fund, and future pledgeable options to accelerate asset growth?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: <strong>No.</strong> Risk tolerance decreases as retirement approaches, the time window is short, and you should be more conservative. Since the Pension already covers most of the expenses, the urgency for asset growth should be reduced. <strong>The most aggressive allocation for retirement or near retirement, without using pledges and without holding leveraged funds, is 80% QQQ + 20% cash.</strong> Pension should be regarded as a stable source of income, and when calculating the total amount of retirement funds required, the <strong>Pension portion should be deducted</strong> from annual expenses first, and then the remaining net expenditure needs should be multiplied by a multiple (such as 30 or 50 times). If you hold leveraged funds, you must sell them and deal with tax issues before retirement.</li>

<p>This lecture once again consolidates James&rsquo;s core investment philosophy: <strong>taking sufficient cash reserves as a prerequisite for ultra-long-term (15+ years) holding of the Nasdaq 100 index fund.</strong> It emphasizes the priority of risk management, especially determining the cash ratio based on individual circumstances and building asset allocation based on this, rather than pursuing a specific Beta value or being driven by market sentiment. The differences in risk perception at different life stages and wealth levels were discussed, and the use of high-risk leverage (such as margin trading) for investment was strongly opposed. In addition, practical advice and warnings were shared on tax planning, retirement preparation, financial service selection, and consumption mentality. The Q&amp;A session delved into the specific problems encountered by students in practice, further clarifying strategy details and risk considerations, such as retirement fund calculation, the view on global diversification, and psychological management techniques (focus on overall portfolio rather than local volatility). Overall, this content revolves around the two words <strong>&ldquo;determination&rdquo;</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;safety,&rdquo;</strong> that is, maintaining strategic determination and financial security in a volatile market, and adhering to the correct principles.</p>
