<ul>
<li><strong>Assets</strong>: Generally refer to all resources of economic value owned by an individual or household, including current assets (such as cash, deposits, stocks) and fixed assets (such as real estate, cars, collectibles). In everyday conversation, the &ldquo;assets&rdquo; or &ldquo;wealth&rdquo; people talk about usually refers to total assets.</li>
<li><strong>Liabilities</strong>: Refer to the debts owed by an individual or household, including short-term liabilities (such as credit card debt, consumer loans) and long-term liabilities (such as mortgages, car loans).</li>
<li><strong>Equity (Net Worth)</strong>: The balance after deducting liabilities from assets, representing the true wealth owned by an individual or household. This is an important financial indicator that reflects the true financial situation.
<ul>
<li><strong>Formula</strong>: Net Worth = Assets - Liabilities</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If you own a house worth 5 million, but still owe 3.5 million on the mortgage, then your net worth is 1.5 million (5 million - 3.5 million = 1.5 million).</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>ROE (Return on Equity)</strong>: A metric that measures the efficiency of investing one&rsquo;s own funds, reflecting the return generated by each unit of net worth.
<ul>
<li><strong>Formula</strong>: ROE = Net Profit / Net Worth</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If your real estate net worth is 6 million (total price 15 million, loan 9 million), and the property appreciates by 500,000 in a year, then your ROE = 500,000 / 6 million = 8.33%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ROA (Return on Assets)</strong>: A metric that measures the efficiency of total asset utilization, reflecting the return generated by each unit of total assets.
<ul>
<li><strong>Formula</strong>: ROA = Net Profit / Total Assets</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If you invest 15 million in total assets (real estate) and earn 500,000 in a year, then ROA = 500,000 / 15 million ≈ 3.33%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ROI (Return on Investment)</strong>: A metric that measures the benefit of a specific investment project, reflecting the return generated by each unit of investment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Formula</strong>: ROI = (Investment Gain - Investment Cost) / Investment Cost</li>
<li><strong>Special Case</strong>: If all assets are used for investment and there are no idle funds, then ROA ≈ ROI.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impact of Borrowing</strong>: If borrowing is used for stock investment (such as margin trading, credit loans, mortgages, etc.), then the return on equity (ROE) will increase significantly because you leverage a larger investment scale with less of your own capital.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If you have 15 million in stock assets, of which 9 million is borrowed and 6 million is your own capital. The stock investment yields a 14% return in one year (2.1 million). Then ROA = 2.1 million / 15 million = 14%, and ROE = 2.1 million / 6 million = 35%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Cash</strong>: To control risk, investors usually don&rsquo;t invest all of their funds in the stock market and instead retain a portion of cash. This portion of cash reduces the overall return on investment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Beta</strong>: Beta &lt; 1 indicates that the volatility of the investment portfolio is less than the overall market volatility, usually meaning holding cash or low-risk assets.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If you have total assets of 15 million, of which 2 million is cash and the actual stock investment is 13 million. If the stock return is still 14%, then the total return is 1.82 million (13 million * 14%). ROA = 1.82 million / 15 million ≈ 12.13%, ROI = 1.82 million / 13 million = 14%.</li>
<li><strong>ROI of Short-Term Operators</strong>: Short-term operators or options traders typically only invest a small amount of capital. The &ldquo;return&rdquo; they talk about is often ROI rather than ROE. For example, they may have 1 million in funds but only use 100,000 for options trading and earn 30,000. They may say their ROI is 30%. But in reality, their ROE is only 3% (30,000 / 1 million).</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buffett&rsquo;s View</strong>: Warren Buffett emphasizes that whether evaluating a business or a personal investment, one should focus on ROE (return on equity) rather than ROI (return on investment). ROE more truly reflects the efficiency of capital utilization and profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Independent Thinking</strong>: Don&rsquo;t easily listen to other people&rsquo;s investment advice. Develop your own investment system and judgment through self-study.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Awareness</strong>: If you are afraid of market declines and losses, then you may not be suitable for high-risk investments.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Investment</strong>: Invest in index funds such as QQQ and adhere to long-term holding without easily selling.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Individual Stocks</strong>: For most investors, avoid investing in individual stocks because they are riskier and can easily lead to significant losses.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme Optimism</strong>: Maintain an optimistic attitude towards the market, believing that the market will move upward in the long run and continue to reach new highs.</li>
<li><strong>Retirees with Insufficient Funds</strong> can consider high-dividend ETFs (0056 or HSPHD) to increase cash flow.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Single Investment in QQQ</strong>: If only investing in QQQ (or 00662), one can withdraw 2% of assets annually as living expenses.</li>
<li><strong>QQQ + High-Dividend ETF</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If 2% of living expenses is not enough, consider allocating a portion to high-dividend ETFs (such as 0056 or HSPHD). These ETFs may have a dividend yield of 4%-5%.</li>
<li>For example: Invest 50% of the funds in QQQ and the other 50% in high-dividend ETFs (80% in 0056 + 20% in 00864B).</li>

<li>Question 1: Previously, it was mentioned that investing in QQQ/00662 contributes to the capitalist market, but if you buy a 2x leveraged ETF, which is essentially deployed through futures, does it still contribute to society? Is the contribution the same?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: There is a contribution, and it is a double contribution. Because there are many ways to hold assets, you can choose to directly hold the underlying stock or use financing (borrowing money) to expand the investment scale. Some 2x leveraged ETFs achieve this through borrowing, while others use futures and other derivatives. Regardless of the method, it is putting capital into the market, supporting the operation and development of businesses. Capitalists contribute the most to society by investing and allocating resources to the most promising companies. Investing in an index fund like QQQ means allocating funds to the best companies on the market, supporting their innovation and development, and thereby creating value for all of humanity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: The student&rsquo;s concern is that a large part of 2x leveraged ETFs consists of futures, and futures trading is perceived as a zero-sum game, where one party&rsquo;s profit necessarily means another party&rsquo;s loss. Would this contradict our previous emphasis on the concept of &ldquo;contributing to society&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: First of all, not all the funds in our investment portfolio have to be used for investment. We can keep a portion of cash. Secondly, futures trading can also be understood as a &ldquo;pre-purchase,&rdquo; similar to a &ldquo;red slip&rdquo; (pre-sale contract) when buying a house. You pay a deposit, locking in the future right to purchase, which provides financial support to the developer and promotes market liquidity. Futures trading is similar in that investors commit to buying or selling assets at a specific price at a future date, which provides liquidity and price discovery mechanisms to the market. Therefore, our investments, including the use of leveraged instruments, contribute to the market.</li>

<li>
<p>Share 1: Asset allocation of 433 and 442 should strictly follow the proportions of QQQ/QID/short-term bonds. In Taiwan, these are 00662, 00670L, and 00864B. Do not arbitrarily combine different targets, as this may deviate from our calculated expected returns and risks.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: If you have a mortgage or credit loan, it usually means you are still working. If you are retired, it is best not to have these loans, as this will increase your financial pressure. Retired people should not borrow credit loans and should pay off their mortgages. Net worth after retirement is the basis for calculating your retirement income (50 times your annual expenses). If you are still working, you can moderately use leverage (such as stock pledges), borrowing 2% of your stock assets for consumption while continuing to increase investment. As your assets increase, gradually adjust the proportion of borrowing and consumption. Also, remind everyone that if friends do not watch our investment tutorial videos, then do not advise them to invest, because investment requires doing your own homework and making decisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share 2: When combining your own investment targets, you must clearly understand the volatility of each target. We understand the characteristics of the QID or 00670L we recommend. If you combine them yourself and do not understand the volatility, you need to do your own simulation backtesting, otherwise the risk will be very high.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: I currently have 1/4 of my assets under my adult child&rsquo;s name, and I plan to retire in 3 years. Can this portion of assets under my child&rsquo;s name be included in my retirement fund calculation?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: No, once you have given it to your children, it is their asset. If you can freely access their money, then of course it can be counted as your asset, but you have to consider the possible legal and family relationship issues in the future. I suggest you transfer the money back into your account first, and only consider giving it to them after you are truly retired and your assets exceed 50 times your annual expenses. Before retirement, it is not recommended to give money to your children; just give a small amount of lucky money.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: If I include my child&rsquo;s account, I can retire now; but if I don&rsquo;t count this portion, my assets do not yet reach 50 times my annual expenses.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: If you want to retire, transfer the money back. Otherwise, there may be changes over time. After you retire, if your assets appreciate to more than you need, you can consider giving it to your children. At least this will ensure that your own retirement life is not affected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: I have invested in VOO and QQQ. When I see the market at a high point, should I sell first and buy back when it falls to a low point?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Our investment strategy is to buy when we have money, hold for the long term, and not time the market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 4: I bought an annuity many years ago, investing 150,000, and now I can only receive a few hundred dollars back each month. This annuity expires next year. Should I redeem it and invest on my own?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: If you can hold for the long term without easily selling, then the return on an annuity is usually very low, and you can consider redeeming it. But the premise is that you can withstand market fluctuations, even if the market falls 80%, can you still persist in holding on? If so, then redeem the annuity and invest in index funds such as QQQ.</li>

<li>Question: I currently use a long-term holding strategy and put some ETFs into dividends to cover my living expenses. The rest are some bonds and value growth stocks. After listening to the teacher, I really want to convert some of these things into QQQ and leave the dividends behind. Is this good or bad?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: First, you need to determine whether you are retired, how much assets you have, and how much your annual expenses are. If you are retired and the dividend ETF is already enough to cover your living expenses, and you still have a surplus for investment, then you can continue to maintain this state. However if, you want to measure whether you have achieved financial freedom, for example: can you and your family travel to Europe and easily afford all the expenses? If you feel that your current state is very stable, very at ease, and you have enough tolerance for market fluctuations, then you can continue to maintain it. But, if the market declines, you may not be able to withstand it, so don&rsquo;t change it easily.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Suggestion: You can consider selling all your assets and buying 80% 00662 and 20% 00864B. Withdraw 2% of your assets annually as living expenses, and this completes the adjustment of asset allocation.
<ul>

<li>Question: I would like to invest my two children&rsquo;s annual lucky money, and I don&rsquo;t know what type of account I should open for them. Is it a regular brokerage account, an IRA account, or a Roth IRA?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: If the children are still young and have no income, then they cannot open a retirement account such as an IRA or Roth IRA. You can open a regular brokerage account for them, and you are the custodian of the account. You can set a deadline, such as when the children reach 22 or 24 years old, when the control of the account will be handed over to them. Until then, you manage the account entirely. If you withdraw money from the account, you need to pay capital gains tax. But our investment strategy is to hold for the long term without easily selling, so we usually don&rsquo;t need to pay taxes. Only when you have no work income and need money do you consider borrowing from the investment account.</li>

<li>Share: I have been thinking about a problem recently. Assuming we invest in QQQ, after deducting inflation, the annual growth rate of actual purchasing power is about 10%. If a young person in the Bay Area has annual expenses of $120,000, how many years will it take to achieve financial freedom? If he saves $500 per month, calculated at a compound interest rate of 10%, it will take 46-47 years to accumulate more than 6 million. If he saves $1,000 per month, it will take 40 years. If he saves $3,000 per month, it will take 30 years. Like James retiring at the age of 42, if he only uses 20 years, then he must save at least $8,000 or more per month. Therefore, in addition to basic expenses, all the money that can be saved must be invested in the stock market to accumulate wealth as soon as possible. If income is not high, you can only exchange time for money.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Retirement is not that difficult. The key is to be stable and stick to it for 20 years. Young people should adopt a 442 asset allocation (40% QQQ, 40% QLD, 20% cash or short-term bonds), so that the beta coefficient is 1.2, and the annualized rate of return can reach about 17%. In this way, if you invest $3,000 per month, you can accumulate $6 million in 20 years. Therefore, young people must use leverage. A low rate of return is the biggest risk.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: I have been studying with you for three years and have invested in QQQ/00662, 00864B, and 00670L, which I feel has been very helpful. I plan to retire in 4 and a half years. My current asset allocation is 721 (70% QQQ, 20% QLD, 10% cash), and the beta coefficient is 1.1. Should I adjust the beta coefficient to 1.2?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: If you are still working, you can adjust to 1.2. But be aware that 4 and a half years is relatively short. If the market falls sharply, your assets may shrink significantly, making it impossible for you to retire as planned. Also, you mentioned that your current assets are about the same as your mortgage. If you still have a mortgage to pay after retirement, then your retirement income may not be enough. Assuming you have to pay 50,000 per month for your mortgage, that&rsquo;s 600,000 per year. Based on 50 times the retirement income calculation, you need to prepare 30 million to cover this expense. So, you need to carefully evaluate your assets, liabilities, and income after retirement before deciding whether to adjust your asset allocation. After retirement, leveraged funds should no longer be used.</li>

<li>Share 1: I would like to emphasize that whether we invest in prototype ETFs or leveraged ETFs, we are contributing to businesses and society. Even if you put money in the bank, the bank will use that money for investment. Including buying short-term bonds like 00864B provides capital to the government or businesses。
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: There is a contribution, but the degree is different. Putting money in the bank means the bank is making the contribution, and your contribution is limited. Investing in QQQ supports technological progress and contributes more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Share 2: Recently, there has been a phenomenon in Taiwan where many people are borrowing heavily to invest through stock pledges or credit loans, even borrowing up to 60%. I&rsquo;m very worried about this.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: We have always emphasized that borrowing for investment should not exceed 10% of total assets; otherwise, once the market falls sharply, there is a risk of liquidation.</li>

<li>Share 1: About DeepSeek. The demand for AI will only continue to increase, and the demand for computing power has only just begun. The emergence of DeepSeek has shown some small companies opportunities. Some small software companies in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan have found new business models.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: DeepSeek is a driving force for AI development. It adopts a more underlying development method (assembly language) that lowers the barrier to AI development. This makes AI applications more popular, allowing more companies, even companies in the third world, to participate.</li>

</li>
<li>Share 2: Musk has not commented on DeepSeek this time, but he may be doing it quietly. If there is no internet data, can AI continue to develop? This is a question worth considering. Also, some Taiwanese companies are starting to pay attention to edge computing, which is also influenced by DeepSeek.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: Can AI replace existing industries? It&rsquo;s not clear yet. It&rsquo;s more about improving the efficiency of existing things. AI applications will become more and more common, but AI itself may not be a &ldquo;paradigm shift.&rdquo; In addition, AI may have an impact on search engines.

<blockquote>
<p>Investors should always face the sunshine, and the market will definitely break through new highs.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James repeatedly emphasized the importance of a long-term perspective in investment, believing in the long-term upward trend of the market and not being disturbed by short-term fluctuations. Only by remaining optimistic can one persist in the market and obtain long-term returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capitalists are the biggest contributors to society and the people who contribute the most to the world. We have made the most effective allocation of resources.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James believes that capitalists, through investment, allocate resources to the most promising and efficient businesses, supporting innovation and development, thereby promoting the progress and prosperity of the entire society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Living well is the most important thing. Don&rsquo;t save on taxes. We often say that saving on taxes is very important, but when it comes to inheritance, it&rsquo;s not your business, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Inherit as much as you can, but it&rsquo;s important to live well and with dignity.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James, when answering questions about estate planning, emphasized that the quality of life for individuals during their lifetime is more important than the amount of inheritance. Don&rsquo;t sacrifice your current quality of life in order to save on taxes or accumulate excessive wealth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No investment is a life sentence. With investment, you usually get out in 30 years, 30 years at the latest.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James encourages everyone to start investing as early as possible, even small amounts, as long as they persist in long-term investment, they can accumulate considerable wealth and eventually achieve financial freedom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You want their interest, and they want your life.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James, when commenting on high-yield Covered Call ETFs, reminds everyone to pay attention to the high risks behind high yields. Don&rsquo;t be misled by high yields and ignore the potential loss of principal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having a house is being a rich poor person. It looks like you have a lot of assets, but you can&rsquo;t spend them; you can&rsquo;t spend freely.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James believes that although real estate is an asset, it is illiquid and cannot be easily converted into cash, which may limit personal spending power and quality of life. Over-concentration on real estate investment may lead to the predicament of &ldquo;having assets but no cash.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that general companies that adapt to AI usually fail, because that cost will be beyond your imagination, and it will slow down your performance.
&ndash; Brian</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brian pointed out, when discussing AI applications, that many companies may encounter problems such as high costs and reduced efficiency when trying to introduce AI. The application of AI technology is not easy and requires careful planning and implementation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do you find that the Tesla Model 9 has been completely changed? The whole thing cannot be gradually changed from the old one, gone, retrained.
&ndash; Brian</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brian mentioned that updates to Tesla&rsquo;s self-driving system usually employ entirely new models rather than incrementally improving existing models. This illustrates that the iteration and development of AI technology may be leaping, and old technology may be quickly eliminated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To achieve creation and thinking, you have to be better today than yesterday. How can anyone catch up with you that way?
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James emphasized that continuous learning and innovation are key to staying competitive. Whether in the field of investment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Buy with money, never sell no matter what
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James summarized that the best strategy for long-term investors is to choose quality assets (such as the QQQ index fund), hold them for the long term, don&rsquo;t time the market, and don&rsquo;t sell easily.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Market Trends and Investment Philosophy:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Drives the Future:</strong> AI demand is not a bubble, but a genuine driving force behind technological advancement, promising a bull market spanning two decades.  We are currently in the early stages of this growth.  Morris Chang (TSMC Chairman)&rsquo;s perspective and TSMC&rsquo;s investments in AI corroborate this judgment. The long bull market has begun, seize the opportunity to join the wealth train.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility and Long-Term Investment:</strong> Market fluctuations are inherent to investing.  Downswings are followed by even greater upswings. Using historical data from the Taiwan Weighted Index, Nikkei Index, and the US stock market as examples, the session illustrates the long-term market development pattern: an initial period of rapid growth followed by a period of stagnation (e.g., 32 years in Taiwan, 35 years in Japan, 24 years in the US), before entering a phase of stable growth.  Therefore, overcoming panic caused by market volatility and adhering to a long-term investment strategy is crucial for ultimate success.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalism and Investment:</strong>  The side effects of capitalism are wealth disparity and the exploitation of labor. Learn to operate like a capitalist and profit from investment.  Hard work and saving money to buy government bonds will ultimately result in wealth erosion due to inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits of Quantitative Easing:</strong> Quantitative easing is beneficial for investors, fostering a low-interest-rate environment and driving asset price appreciation.  Those who fail to understand quantitative easing and complain about government money printing are often victims of capitalism, missing out on the benefits of asset appreciation.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics of a Mature Market:</strong> Mature markets are characterized by fair, just, and transparent regulatory mechanisms, companies focused on their core businesses, and a high proportion of long-term investors and institutional holdings. The Taiwanese market is gradually maturing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Investment Strategies and Recommendations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invest in Nasdaq 100:</strong>  The session recommends investing in Nasdaq 100 index funds (QQQ), with the option to allocate to S&amp;P 500 or high-dividend ETFs based on individual circumstances.  References to Nasdaq 100 index funds globally are provided for the convenience of investors worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Penny Stocks:</strong>  Refrain from investing in penny stocks, as they generally offer low long-term returns.  Real investment opportunities lie in companies that demonstrate sustained growth and lead technological advancements.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of Stock Pledging:</strong> Stock pledging offers advantages over real estate mortgages, as stocks, unlike real estate, do not depreciate and can be held long-term, potentially allowing for &ldquo;borrowing without repayment or interest&rdquo; (specific instructions are available in related videos).</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Flawed Rebalancing Strategies:</strong> Avoid a 50% principal + 50% leveraged ETF rebalancing strategy, as it carries high risk and can easily deplete cash reserves during market downturns.</li>
<li><strong>Estate Planning and Stock Pledging:</strong> When engaging in stock pledging, it is advisable to diversify assets across multiple brokerage firms, pledging a portion and keeping the rest as cash to facilitate estate handling for inheritors.  Cat supplemented this with a detailed explanation of the stock pledging inheritance process, emphasizing the importance of advance planning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Other Important Matters:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Warning and Disclaimer:</strong>  The content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.  Do not remit funds to unknown accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Program Format Adjustment:</strong>  The presentation content will be expanded to include material previously covered in short videos.</li>
<li><strong>QQQ Stock Selection Mechanism:</strong>  Addresses audience questions regarding the QQQ stock selection mechanism, explaining the advantages of the Nasdaq exchange and why technology companies prefer listing on Nasdaq.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging for Non-US Residents:</strong> Explains the regulations for non-US residents engaging in stock pledging with US brokers.</li>
<li><strong>Learning to Spend:</strong> Shares the philosophy of spending after achieving investment success, emphasizing the importance of focusing on future wealth growth and utilizing financial leverage for consumption.  Don&rsquo;t let wealth sit idle; learn how to use it.  This point is illustrated with the example of a listener who has $4 million but doesn&rsquo;t know how to spend it, calculating their potential wealth growth over 40 years and a reasonable spending level.</li>

<p><strong>IAM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Expressed confusion about different types of economic crises and how the 2020-2023 pandemic period compares to previous bubbles after reading a book about economic crises.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  Which historical economic crisis is most similar to the economic downturn during the 2020-2023 pandemic?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The 2020-2023 pandemic was an economic shock caused by an external event, distinct from previous bubble economies. The 2000 dot-com bubble was an industry bubble with limited impact; the 2008 financial crisis resembled the 1929 Great Depression, both being asset bubble bursts, but the 2008 crisis recovered faster due to quantitative easing. The 2022 market decline was not a bubble burst, but a revaluation caused by central bank interest rate hikes.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> What did the US do to stimulate the economy that other countries couldn&rsquo;t replicate?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The US is less constrained by fiscal discipline and is willing to borrow and issue debt, allocating funds to social welfare programs for the elderly, children, and healthcare, while guiding domestic capital towards overseas investment to mitigate inflation.  Taiwan&rsquo;s government was advised to learn from the US&rsquo;s fiscal spending approach and guide capital towards investment, while also focusing on efficient capital utilization and building a social safety net.</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> Why are Chinese people so keen on buying houses?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> This is a vestige of the agrarian &ldquo;land is wealth&rdquo; mentality, which is no longer applicable today.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eason (Doctor):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Points to consider for Chinese investors buying Nasdaq ETFs:
<ul>
<li>Different brokerage firms have different fee policies and financing rates; careful comparison is necessary.</li>
<li>Domestic Nasdaq ETFs have premiums; buying during periods of low or negative premiums is recommended.  There are no limits for buying ETFs on the exchange, but there are limits for off-exchange subscriptions.</li>
<li>Recommends allocating a portion of assets to USD-denominated investments like QQQ, which can be purchased by opening brokerage accounts in Singapore or Hong Kong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Added:</strong>  Chinese residents have a $50,000 annual foreign exchange quota for overseas investments.  Hong Kong and mainland China identities have different withholding tax rates on US stock investments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dave:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Will the Nasdaq 100 index become stagnant like the Dow Jones index?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Currently, the Nasdaq 100 is the most competitive; excessive worry about the future is unnecessary.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> Is it feasible to only buy the top 10 companies in the Nasdaq 100 index?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The top ten companies change frequently; individual stock selection and portfolio adjustments are too cumbersome, and returns may not be higher.  Investing directly in index funds is more efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> How do VGT and XLK compare to QQQ?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> VGT and XLK track different indices than QQQ, with different constituent stocks and concentration. QQQ is more robust and has broader coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jiawen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Can an 80% leveraged ETF + 10% cash + 10% bond portfolio be directly pledged? How is this done?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, but a small-scale trial is recommended, for instance, borrowing $200,000 against $5 million in principal, or borrowing within $1 million against $10 million. Long-term borrowing strategies should be adjusted according to circumstances. It&rsquo;s possible to pledge only a portion of the stocks, leaving the remainder for additional purchases or other uses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Personal investment journey, transitioning from real estate to stocks, learning about stock pledging and asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Is there synergy between real estate and stock investment? How can real estate cash flow be used for stock investment?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  Buying a house is not recommended for young people. Real estate investment returns are lower than stocks and come with various risks (e.g., natural disasters, property taxes).  Even with positive cash flow, opportunity costs should be considered; investing that capital in stocks might yield higher returns.  Used Texas real estate as an example to illustrate the drawbacks of real estate investment.</li>

<p><strong>Qiu Xiao:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  What are the Canadian equivalents of US retirement accounts like IRA, Roth IRA, and 401k? Which account should cash be held in?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Roth IRA corresponds to Canada&rsquo;s TFSA, Traditional IRA to RRSP, and 401k to DCPP. The choice of retirement account for cash depends on the individual&rsquo;s balance between taxable and tax-free accounts and their asset allocation strategy.  One should choose to place cash in either a tax-free or taxable account based on their specific circumstances for tax optimization.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2 (Related to Eason&rsquo;s question):</strong> How can one invest in Nasdaq ETFs in China, and how can quota limitations be addressed?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Off-exchange subscriptions have quota limits, while on-exchange ETF purchases do not, but premiums should be considered.  Opening multiple brokerage accounts or opening an account in Hong Kong for US stock investment can be considered.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Question:</strong> How can we address the challenge of youth unemployment in the AI era?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  Young people need to acquire AI skills to adapt to the future job market.  Recommends that schools incorporate AI courses into their core curriculum, cultivating AI talent from a young age. Philosophy is an important foundational subject but should not be a primary career focus.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Discussed the changing times and the need for young people to adapt, sharing observations about the youthful demographics of Xiamen. Mentioned the importance of aligning investments with the times and shared some common misunderstandings about investing he had encountered.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What are your views on index fund investing? Is the long-term return of 0050 sufficient? What are your thoughts on individual stock investing (e.g., TSMC)?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Index fund investing is a method accessible to the general public, but many don&rsquo;t understand it and require time and experience to appreciate it. In the long run, QQQ and SPY offer higher returns and are more suitable for long-term investment. Individual stock picking demands specialized knowledge and skills and carries higher risks; it is difficult for average investors to select and hold high-quality stocks like TSMC for the long term.  The key to investing is finding investment targets that can be held long-term and sticking with them.</li>
