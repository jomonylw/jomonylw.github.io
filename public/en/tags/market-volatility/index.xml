      <description>In this lecture, James emphasizes that long-term investors need not pay excessive attention to short-term market volatility, international affairs, financial statements, or economic conditions. The core strategy is to buy and hold high-quality index funds (such as the Nasdaq 100) and maintain a long-term holding period (10-20 years or more), aiming for returns of several times the initial investment. The lecture focuses on the importance of risk management, including holding sufficient cash, understanding and accepting the possibility of significant market declines (such as 50% or more), and avoiding leverage or market timing. It also addresses questions from students regarding asset allocation (433, 442), annual rebalancing, investing new funds, the Canadian ETF (HXQ), managing mindset during market downturns, handling differing investment views among family members, and opinions on current market events (such as tariffs).</description>

<p>The core theme of this lecture is <strong>the mindset and strategies of long-term investors</strong>: adhering to a long-term hold of index funds in the face of market volatility and uncertainty, ignoring short-term fluctuations, and emphasizing the importance of risk management and maintaining sufficient cash.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market Volatility Irrelevance:</strong> For investors preparing to hold assets for 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, or even longer (such as for retirement), short-term market price fluctuations (&ldquo;market price&rdquo;) are irrelevant because they are not selling at this moment. The focus should be on long-term (10-20 years later) multiple (4x, 5x, 10x) growth.</li>
<li><strong>Information Noise Filtering:</strong> Short-term information such as market analysis, financial statements, economic conditions, and international affairs are all noise for long-term investors who are not selling, and should be ignored. Don&rsquo;t listen, don&rsquo;t watch, don&rsquo;t pay attention, and short-term problems will not exist.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Staying Alive&rdquo; is Paramount:</strong> The primary principle of investing is being able to withstand extreme market declines (such as a 50% drop or even more) and &ldquo;stay alive.&rdquo; Those who cannot tolerate volatility are not suitable for investing and should stay away from the market.</li>
<li><strong>Risk is Ubiquitous:</strong> Risk can happen at any time (an earthquake next second, a company going bankrupt, etc.). Recognize, understand, and control risk. Be prepared to deal with the worst-case scenarios (such as the market going to zero, unemployment), ensuring basic living necessities are met.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Cash:</strong> Allocating sufficient cash (such as 20% or more) is key to risk control, ensuring the ability to maintain living standards during a market crash.</li>
<li><strong>Investor Optimism:</strong> Investing is like starting a business, requiring extreme optimism and belief that the market will eventually rise (&ldquo;always towards the sunlight&rdquo;).</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Greed and Fear:</strong> Do not try to &ldquo;buy the dip&rdquo; (&ldquo;touching the bottom might lead to touching a great white shark&rdquo;), &ldquo;the more greedy, the poorer.&rdquo; The market has no bottom, only lower. Maintain a peaceful mindset, not panicking due to declines.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on Index Funds:</strong> Primarily invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ and its local versions, such as Taiwan 00662, Canada HXQ). Investing in individual stocks is not recommended because the risk of individual stocks far exceeds that of indexes (greater volatility, risk of disappearing).</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Never Sell&rdquo; Only Applies to Indexes:</strong> The strategy of &ldquo;buy and hold, never sell&rdquo; applies to index funds because they have a self-elimination and update mechanism. Individual stocks cannot guarantee long-term existence (such as Kodak, BlackBerry), requiring timing the sale or switching stocks. Buffett&rsquo;s holding of Coca-Cola is also not absolutely eternal.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation and Rebalancing:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Allocation Ratio:</strong> Mentioned allocation methods such as 433 (40% original + 30% leverage + 30% cash) and 442 (40% original + 40% leverage + 20% cash).</li>
<li><strong>Investing New Funds:</strong> Invest according to the allocation ratio. For example, under the 433 allocation, a monthly salary can be invested with 6 months in the original, 3 months in leverage, and 3 months in cash. For 442, invest with 4 months in the original, 4 months in leverage, and 4 months in cash (or 5/5/2 or other approximately correct methods).</li>
<li><strong>Annual Rebalancing:</strong> Rebalance once a year at the end of the year. No need to be too precise with monthly investments. Frequent rebalancing (such as based on price points) is incorrect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Canadian ETF HXQ:</strong> Specifically mentioned Canada&rsquo;s HXQ, because it does not pay dividends, avoiding withholding tax, making it an alternative to QC.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Independent Learning:</strong> Emphasized the importance of independent learning and thinking, recommending watching specific series of videos (e.g., newcomers watch 451, then start from 398 and watch in order to the latest).</li>
<li><strong>Community Selection:</strong> Be wary of noisy investment groups lacking effective answers, or even containing &ldquo;deviant&rdquo; viewpoints. It&rsquo;s better to ask James directly. Mentioned that a certain mainland group has become frivolous and started charging fees, discouraging participation.</li>
<li><strong>Understand the Spirit, Not the Letter:</strong> When taking advice (such as &ldquo;never sell&rdquo;), understand its core spirit (long-term holding philosophy), rather than nitpicking (such as questioning whether rebalancing counts as selling).</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Predict the Market:</strong> It&rsquo;s impossible to predict market highs and lows. Don&rsquo;t try to buy the dip or sell high and buy low. Most people can&rsquo;t do it. CC&rsquo;s example illustrates the consequences of failed selling high and buying low.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage Risk:</strong> <strong>Absolutely prohibit</strong> using funds from stock pledging or margin to reinvest and increase positions. Market declines can far exceed expectations (halving again after halving). Leverage will amplify risk, leading to liquidation (&ldquo;being carried out&rdquo;). Even top investors like Buffett and Howard Marks cannot predict the absolute bottom.
<ul>
<li><strong>Distinguish Safe Leverage:</strong> 理财型 mortgage (such as in Taiwan) used for investment is feasible if the interest can be afforded. Its risk nature is different from stock pledging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bottom Signals:</strong> True market bottoms are usually accompanied by extreme panic, with no one daring to buy and bulls in despair. When people still want to buy the dip and add leverage, it&rsquo;s usually not the real bottom.</li>
<li><strong>Different Perspectives:</strong> Understand that the views of different people (e.g., Musk vs. Buffett) stem from their different positions and experiences. No need to argue about right or wrong, the focus is on understanding their logic.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: The market is fluctuating, and friends are reacting strongly, but the teacher and myself remain calm. Shared a &ldquo;psychological stability card&rdquo; made by a friend, available on their social media.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Narrated the story of a friend who trusted her teacher in 2018, when the US-China trade war caused a sharp 20% market drop, and insisted on selling stocks because they couldn&rsquo;t handle the pressure. Emphasized the importance of mental state, and that &ldquo;leaving the market&rdquo; is a greater risk than market declines, like jumping off a speeding train.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: Leaving the market is indeed a greater risk than the market decline itself, and it is difficult to recover.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Which videos should beginners watch? (Didn&rsquo;t remember the series the teacher mentioned earlier)
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Look at the links in the handout. Beginners should first watch <strong>00451</strong>, then start from <strong>00398</strong> and watch in order to the latest (about 100).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: How exactly do you do rebalancing once a year?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Watch the videos to learn (e.g., 00451 and subsequent series).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: Are index funds passively managed and will automatically change their constituent stocks?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Yes, for example, QQQ will automatically adjust, maintaining the top 100 Nasdaq companies by market capitalization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 4: After experiencing market volatility, should I sell one-third after the stock price rises by 30% to lock in profits, and then buy back when there is a correction?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: The idea is good, but in practice, almost no one can do it. If you could do it, you wouldn&rsquo;t need to come to learn. Market timing is very difficult and not recommended. Suggested that she could try it and then come back to share the results. Historically, if this method worked, many people would be richer than Buffett.</li>

<li>Question 1: As a new member attending for the first time, how should I start learning? Should I start with the earliest videos, or are there specific recommendations?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: First watch the <strong>00451</strong> video. After watching, you can start investing a portion of your funds (beginners are advised to invest up to 50% at first). Then start from <strong>00398</strong> and watch in order to the latest (about 100). When investing, be sure to keep at least 20% cash.

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: Shared personal experience: Came into contact with the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy in 2020, established a position at the high point in 2021 (cost about 340), and did not sell when it fell to 259. When it returned to breakeven in August 2023, she was worried about another decline and sold, wanting to buy back at a lower position. As a result, the market did not fall below and went all the way up, eventually chasing back at a higher position (cost 409). Realized the difficulty of market timing and the importance of holding faith. Now has a peaceful mindset in the face of declines.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: Ordinary investors have no valuation ability and cannot judge highs and lows, so they should not time the market. Accepting the long-term return of the index (annualized 10-12%) is a realistic and effective strategy.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: Learned about the teacher&rsquo;s method through his aunt and cut off individual stocks, switching to QQQ/00662.</li>
<li>Question 1: Previously, borrowed NT$2 million when QQQ was about 500 and invested it all at once (believing in not guessing highs and lows). Now the market is falling, and there is no extra cash. Can I continue to increase positions through stock pledge loans?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: <strong>Absolutely not!</strong> The market may fall even deeper (halving again after halving). Pledging and reinvesting carries the risk of being forcibly liquidated to zero (&ldquo;being carried out&rdquo;). Risk is unpredictable (such as a major earthquake destroying a technology park). Don&rsquo;t do anything that could lead to &ldquo;death&rdquo; (the end of your investment career), even if the probability is small. Being stuck won&rsquo;t kill you, but adding leverage might.</li>
<li>Kate&rsquo;s Comment: The market often reverses after washing out leveraged investors, and borrowing money to buy the dip is very dangerous.</li>

<li>Question 1: Should I invest in batches now that I have money? The teacher said not to buy the dip, so should I invest now?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: &ldquo;Depends.&rdquo; It depends on the individual&rsquo;s existing investment size, cash ratio, and risk tolerance. Relative to an existing large investment portfolio, a small amount of new funds (such as salary surplus) can be invested all at once. If the new funds account for a relatively large proportion, or the investor&rsquo;s mindset is tense, then it should be invested in batches, or adopt right-side trading (wait for the market to confirm the rise before buying). The key is to let yourself &ldquo;eat well and sleep well.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Sharing 1: The current market situation is similar to the trade war period during Trump&rsquo;s first term. The teacher&rsquo;s previous teachings (cash is the best medicine against human nature, human nature oscillates between greed and fear, annual rebalancing, not buying the dip) provide the answers. Now is a good time to review and learn.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: Agreed. Investing does not need to pursue exorbitant profits. An annualized return of 10-12% is enough to get rich. The key is to survive. Quoting Munger(?): &ldquo;Newbies die on the mountaintop, experts die halfway up the mountain, and veterans die at the bottom of the valley (being scared away).&rdquo; We need a safe and sustainable method, not luck.</li>

<li>Sharing 2: Shared personal lessons: After the pandemic, I did not believe the teacher. During the big drop in 2022, I liquidated my stocks and switched to US dollar fixed deposits with 5% interest, and missed the sharp rebound in 2023. The return was far less than holding the index. Now fully follows the teacher&rsquo;s strategy, and my mindset is calm.</li>
<li>Sharing 3: Plans to use the 理财型 mortgage (home equity line of credit) on the house to increase investment when the market falls.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: A <strong>理财型 mortgage</strong> (if the interest can be afforded) is different from <strong>stock pledging</strong>. The former has controllable risk, while the latter has extremely high risk. Yin&rsquo;s approach is wise (Smart).</li>

<li>Sharing 1: Reviewed six years of learning history, once took detours (such as playing TQQQ), but stopped after Munger&rsquo;s warning about leverage. Realized the subtlety of the teacher&rsquo;s method and wealth growth (2% of living expenses has doubled). Admitted that he did not fully follow the annual rebalancing principle (once operated according to price points) and realized the mistake.</li>
<li>Question 1: The USADCOK website shows that the total value of the US stock market is still 50T after the market decline, and has not decreased. What is the reason?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: I don&rsquo;t know the specific calculation method of the website, and it may not fully reflect the change in market value in real time. Further research is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: How do you view Musk&rsquo;s criticism of Buffett-style investing (unearned income)?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Understand Musk&rsquo;s perspective (creating value through real industry). But Buffett also has his contributions (effectively allocating funds and supporting the development of enterprises). The two represent different perspectives, with no absolute right or wrong. The important thing is to understand why they say so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: Regarding the risk comparison between Taiwan 0050 (Taiwan Top 50) and 00662 (Fubon Nasdaq) (due to concerns about the risk of the top seven technology stocks).
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: (Mentioned in the subsequent chat records) QQQ (similar to 00662) is already sufficiently diversified, and the return is usually the highest. Global markets are highly correlated, and diversification into other markets is not very meaningful.</li>

<li>Question 1: I invested the proceeds from selling my house at the end of last year into 00662 all at once, at a relatively high point, and now I regret not investing in batches. Currently, I have a 433 configuration, but not much cash. Can I adjust to 442 and transfer some money market funds into the leveraged fund (00670L) to buy the dip?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: <strong>It is not recommended</strong> to reduce the cash ratio (from 30% to 20%) when the market is falling and you feel uneasy. Maintain the existing configuration and wait until the end of the year to re-evaluate. Holding 30% cash safely is more stable than taking the risk of increasing positions. Suggest deleting the APP, out of sight, out of mind, and focus on the cash held.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: How do you view the potential impact of Trump&rsquo;s possible global tariffs on the future?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Believes it is a short-term disruption, with a smaller impact than the trade freeze during the pandemic. The market and businessmen are highly adaptable and will quickly find a balance, eventually &ldquo;passing water leaves no trace.&rdquo; No need to worry too much.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: Gleaned a philosophy of life from the teacher&rsquo;s investment philosophy (observing, listening, and understanding from multiple perspectives).</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Difficulty in trying to teach investing to friends around me: friends don&rsquo;t understand indexes and prefer low-priced stocks; have low expectations for returns (3-5%); have weak savings ability. Discovered that the key problem is the habit of saving rather than the investment return itself.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: It is difficult to teach others, because people only accept what they want to accept. Knowledge requires practice. Listening without practice is like the blind touching an elephant. Encourage taking action (such as going to the bank in person to handle pledging to understand the process) rather than asking endless questions.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: Explained and apologized for the potential noise, poor management, and fee-charging group issues in the mainland WeChat group he manages. Explained the challenges of WeChat group restrictions, complex member backgrounds, and network restrictions. The fee-charging group is for discussing sensitive strategies under domestic policies in a smaller range (such as using financing to achieve a pledge effect), which is voluntary and refundable. Emphasized that he answers questions from group members privately seriously.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Shared personal lessons: When using stock financing to achieve a pledge effect, it is easy to &ldquo;get carried away&rdquo; beyond the predetermined proportion (such as 10%), and failed to promptly convert the obtained funds into cash, but continued to invest, amplifying the risk. Warned about the human challenge of leverage operations.</li>
<li>Sharing 3: Reminded domestic investors that although transferring funds to Hong Kong to purchase US dollar money market funds has higher returns, the difficulty of returning funds under foreign exchange control must be considered.

<li>Question 1: If you have 1 million in cash (regardless of the source), how would James invest in the current &ldquo;bear market&rdquo; atmosphere?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Emphasized again &ldquo;Depends.&rdquo; It depends on the existing asset size, cash ratio, and risk tolerance. Small funds relative to a large portfolio can be invested all at once. Large funds or beginners/people with unstable mindsets should invest in batches, or wait for the market to recover (right-side trading). The key is to find a way that makes you comfortable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Another approach is to wait for the stock price to return to the buying point (such as 500) before buying. What kind of people is this suitable for?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Suitable for people who cannot tolerate book losses, and losses will seriously affect their mentality and even lead to selling at the bottom. This approach sacrifices some potential returns, but preserves the mindset and the possibility of continued investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: QQQ has risen from a high point of 408 at the end of 2021 to about 423 in April 2025. The return has not been high in the past four years (about 15/3.5 years?). How do you view this?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Three or four years is still short-term. Citing historical data (S&amp;P 500), investing for 5 years may still result in losses (annualized -2.58% is the historical worst). The focus is on the long term. There is a high probability of profit for <strong>15 years or more</strong>. Even in the worst 15-year period in history, the annualized return is about 4.21%. It is calculated that even if you buy at the highest point of 408 in 2021, after 15 years (2036), the stock price should reach about 742 even under the worst-case scenario. Looking back from 2036, today&rsquo;s 422 is an enviable low point.</li>

<li>Question 1: My nephew (24-year-old soldier) borrowed NT$2 million at a high point (QQQ around 500) and invested it all at once. Previously had a dollar-cost averaging foundation. Now faces enormous pressure from a strong mother (who only believes in real estate) who demands that he sell the stocks. The nephew himself is also under pressure, and even asked whether he could finance to increase positions. How to help the nephew cope with the pressure and persuade/appease the elders?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Unable to change the elders&rsquo; views, it is recommended to <strong>&ldquo;pay lip service&rdquo;</strong> to the mother (tell her that you have sold and stop sharing information) to protect the nephew from interference. Encourage the nephew to persist in long-term investment (hoping to be financially free after 15 years), emphasizing that he is very young and time is his greatest advantage. Any&rsquo;s support as an aunt is very important and can provide spiritual and necessary emergency financial support (although the nephew said he doesn&rsquo;t need it).</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Market fluctuations have nothing to do with us&hellip; short-term fluctuations should be ignored&hellip; just wait 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, we&rsquo;re talking about four times, five times, ten times.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Explains why long-term investors do not need to pay attention to short-term market fluctuations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The investment market will still decline in the short term. Lose more than 50% of your assets, so you must be able to survive. No matter how the market falls, you must survive. Survival is the key.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Emphasizes that risk awareness and survival ability are the top priorities of investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Buying and holding and never selling can only be done by people who invest in indexes&hellip; individual stock friends can&rsquo;t do it&hellip; who can guarantee that Moutai will still exist in 100 years&hellip; only index funds can&hellip; be sold at any time.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Distinguishes the differences in holding strategies between index funds and individual stocks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t keep buying and buying and buying while the market is falling, the more greedy you are, the more&hellip; the market has no bottom, only lower&hellip; In the end, investing should be about survival. Who can survive?
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Warns about the risk of blindly increasing positions and buying the dip in a falling market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything can happen with any risk&hellip; Absolutely do not do anything that will kill you, even if it&rsquo;s a one in a million thing&hellip; If you reinvest with financing or pledge and reinvest, you may die, so why would you go that way?
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Strongly opposes using leverage (financing, pledging) for investment, emphasizing its potential destructive risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leaving the market is a very risky behavior&hellip; When the train is running, if you leave the market, how can you chase the train&hellip; You want to jump around in it&hellip; impossible.

</blockquote>
<p>Background: Illustrates the extreme difficulty of seizing opportunities after exiting the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I want to tell everyone is that there must be a formal and safe way. This is what I have learned in 40 years&hellip; Don&rsquo;t rely on luck in the market. You won&rsquo;t be able to survive.

</blockquote>
<p>Background: Summarizes forty years of investment experience, emphasizing the importance of safe and compliant methods, rather than relying on luck.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Newbies die on the mountaintop, experts die halfway up the mountain, and veterans die at the bottom of the valley.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Describes the common causes of failure for investors of different experience levels, emphasizing the ruthlessness of the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Funds are not effective, so we must effectively allocate funds like Buffett to promote the development of these small and medium-sized enterprises. This is his contribution&hellip; It&rsquo;s just that Elon (Musk) can&rsquo;t see it from his perspective, because they are on different mountain tops.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Explains the social value of Buffett&rsquo;s investment model (effective allocation of capital), responding to Musk&rsquo;s criticism and pointing out the existence of different perspectives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to look at it from a long-term perspective&hellip; After 15 years, it should be&hellip; a minimum of 742&hellip; People in 2036 will look back and be very envious that we can have a stock price of 422 to buy.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Using the worst historical 15-year return to predict the lowest point in the future, emphasizing the attractiveness of the current price from a long-term perspective.</p>

<p>This lecture, against the backdrop of market volatility, once again reaffirmed the core concept of long-term investment. James repeatedly emphasized that for investors with a cycle of more than ten years, ignoring short-term noise and adhering to holding high-quality index funds such as the Nasdaq 100 is key. Of particular importance is risk management, including maintaining sufficient cash, deeply understanding and accepting the possibility of significant market fluctuations, and <strong>absolutely prohibiting</strong> the use of leverage or stock pledges for reinvestment. The Q&amp;A session explored asset allocation, handling new funds, specific ETFs, mindset adjustments to cope with market downturns, handling different investment views among family members, and how to view poor short-term returns from a long-term perspective, among other practical issues, in depth. The core message is: maintain discipline, manage risk, believe in the long term, and you can &ldquo;stay alive&rdquo; on the road to investment and ultimately achieve your wealth goals.</p>

<p>The market is always fluctuating; this is normal. Investors should have a long-term perspective, ignoring short-term volatility and market noise (such as international situations, economic analysis, financial reports, etc.). The core strategy is to hold high-quality index funds (such as QQQ) for the long term, and to make reasonable asset allocation (including cash reserves) based on individual risk tolerance, while overcoming the greed and fear of human nature. Learning and building a firm belief are essential.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market volatility is normal</strong>: A 10% market drop is normal, 20% happens about every two or three years, and 50% may happen every five to ten years. This is like the tides, wind, rain, and earthquakes in nature; it&rsquo;s an inevitable natural phenomenon. Don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;this year is different&rdquo;; every year is the same.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of a long-term perspective</strong>: As long as you stay in the market long enough, you will understand that there is nothing new in the market. The core laws of the market are &ldquo;always rising&rdquo; and &ldquo;always fluctuating.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Ignore the noise</strong>: Market fluctuations, international situations, market analysis, financial reports, and economic situations are all irrelevant to the decisions of long-term investors.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended strategy</strong>: Hold the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ) for the long term; it can be bought worldwide. This is the simplest and most effective strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive request</strong>: Hope everyone likes, leaves comments, and most importantly, subscribes on various platforms (Podcast, Bilibili, YouTube).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learning to build belief</strong>: Investing is simple (buy index funds), but there are many external distractions (monsters and ghosts). You need to build firm belief and willpower through learning, so that you will not be easily swayed by other people&rsquo;s opinions.</li>
<li><strong>Overcoming human weaknesses</strong>: Greed and fear are the biggest enemies of investment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Manifestations of greed</strong>: Chasing high when the market rises, thinking that the opportunity to &ldquo;buy the dip&rdquo; has come when the market falls, and using up all cash too early (e.g., constantly adding positions when the market has just fallen 5%-13%).</li>
<li><strong>Manifestations of fear</strong>: Not daring to buy when the market rises, only FOMOing (fear of missing out) All-in when it has risen too much; panicking when the market falls and selling at a loss at the bottom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Importance of cash</strong>: Ample cash is a magic weapon to overcome human nature (especially fear), as important as air. It makes you feel comfortable and secure when the market falls. Don&rsquo;t exhaust your cash when the market just starts to fall.</li>
<li><strong>Living in the present</strong>: Don&rsquo;t dwell on past mistakes (such as losses in real estate investment), don&rsquo;t worry too much about future uncertainties, focus on the present, and do your current investment and learning well.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finding the comfort zone</strong>: Everyone has a different risk tolerance. You need to find your comfortable asset allocation ratio through market fluctuations (such as 442, 433, 523, 514, 505, etc.), and the cash ratio is very important. If you feel uncomfortable when the market falls, you should adjust to a configuration that you can hold with peace of mind during rebounds.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage risk</strong>: Few people can withstand fluctuations of more than 1.2 times Beta. When the market falls, many people will not be able to stand it and reduce leverage. Don&rsquo;t be overconfident in adding leverage when the market is good.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Some people went from 442 to 0.9x leverage or even lower.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rebalancing</strong>: It is recommended to do rebalancing once a year. Only use a small amount of cash (e.g., 2% per year) to buy if the market is down at the end of the year. Don&rsquo;t operate frequently or exhaust your cash due to monthly or short-term declines.</li>
<li><strong>About full-position leverage</strong>: It is not recommended for young people to use &ldquo;full-position two-times leverage,&rdquo; because there will always be a big bubble in life. High leverage may lead to a significant asset drawdown (e.g., falling to 0.1), which is difficult to recover, and you may reach your goal later than with a stable investment.</li>
<li><strong>Tortoise and hare</strong>: A stable configuration (tortoise) will outperform an aggressive high-leverage strategy (hare) in the long run. Even if the Beta is lower than 1, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose of secured borrowing</strong>: The purpose of secured borrowing is not to pursue extreme returns, but to meet living needs or make better configurations while holding high-quality assets for the long term. The risk lies in the ability to repay the principal, not the interest burden.</li>

<li><strong>US Debt Clock Update</strong>: The website has been updated, adding data such as DoJ Waste Recovery of federal wasted funds and U.S. Hidden Wealth Assets (including gold, minerals, real estate, land, stocks, Recaptured Assets, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>U.S. Balance Sheet</strong> (as of March 27, 2025, approximate numbers):
<ul>
<li>Total Assets: Approximately 168 Trillion (T)</li>
<li>Federal Government Debt (in bond form): Approximately 36 T</li>
<li>Total Liabilities (including credit represented by cash M1/M2, etc.): Approximately 102 T</li>
<li>Annual Income (GDP): Approximately 28 T</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interpretation</strong>: It&rsquo;s like a person having 1.68 million in assets (and the assets are growing at a rate of about 10%), 1.02 million in debt (of which 360,000 is core debt), and an annual salary of 280,000 (which is also growing). The debt is controllable, and the risk of bankruptcy is very low. U.S. dollar cash itself is also a liability, but it will depreciate with inflation, reducing the actual repayment pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Interest problem</strong>: Federal debt interest expenditure is about 1T, which is controllable relative to federal tax revenue (about 4.9T + state tax) and GDP (28T). There is no need to worry too much about the so-called interest exceeding defense spending (about 0.9T), as this comparison is not meaningful.</li>
<li><strong>Clarification of Musk&rsquo;s views</strong>: Musk mainly criticized the <strong>inefficiency and waste</strong> of the U.S. government&rsquo;s spending, rather than the debt itself being unsustainable.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of tariffs</strong>: Raising tariffs essentially shifts costs to consumers, leading to rising prices, which is equivalent to a disguised tax. This is just a different form from directly collecting federal taxes (paying in installments in daily consumption vs. paying once a year). The impact on the overall economy is complex, but for individuals, it may just be &ldquo;shifting from the left pocket to the right pocket.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Threshold: May require assets equivalent to HK$1 million to avoid monthly fees (approximately HK$380).</li>
<li>Transaction fee: Relatively high, but has little impact on long-term holders.</li>
<li>Stock pledge interest rate: HIBOR + 1.2%, currently about 4.92%, which is acceptable.</li>

<li>Conclusion: Houses are &ldquo;invisible cages&rdquo; and tools for governments, the financial industry, and capitalism to bind labor.

<li><strong>Retirement Planning Case (Student Question)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>NT$15 million in funds + NT$5 million in financial-type mortgage.</li>
<li>Suggestion: For the part that needs cash flow, consider buying ETFs such as 0050/0056 that provide dividends, but be aware that their dividends may include principal (selling component stocks).</li>
<li>Investment of NT$15 million: If you don&rsquo;t need to withdraw money from it, you can consider leveraged allocation (such as 433); if you need to withdraw money, you cannot use leverage. Choose the allocation based on the withdrawal rate (the amount needed after deducting Social Security benefits) (e.g., 2% withdrawal with 80/20 QQQ/cash; 3% withdrawal with SPY). The withdrawal rate is key, not the traditional 4% rule.</li>

<li>FSD has a certain &ldquo;perception&rdquo; ability and can judge the intentions of other vehicles/pedestrians and make intelligent reactions.</li>
<li>Value: The teacher believes that FSD is worth the money (willing to spend $100,000 to buy it), improves safety (saves lives), improves the driving experience (reduces family quarrels), and may even reduce insurance premiums (using Tesla Insurance). Strongly recommends buying a Tesla car with FSD (the new Model Y comes standard). Use the teacher&rsquo;s referral code for discounts.</li>

<li><strong>Consumption Concepts and Family (Student Question)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Problem: Family members (such as spouses, parents) continue to demand new car replacements and other consumption due to &ldquo;laborer thinking&rdquo; or material needs, which conflicts with their own goals of accumulating wealth, and they feel annoyed.</li>
<li>Teacher&rsquo;s suggestion:
<ul>
<li>Understand the needs and feelings of family members (love what they love).</li>
<li>Learn to &ldquo;consume smartly,&rdquo; using financial tools (such as secured loans, adjusting allocation ratios) to meet some reasonable needs without excessively affecting the growth of core investments. For example, sell 100,000 QQQ, exchange it for 50,000 QLD (keeping some exposure) + 50,000 cash to buy a car.</li>
<li>The goal of capitalists is to make money generate money and ultimately use it to improve the quality of life, not just to save money. Find a balance between accumulation and consumption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Technology Product Consumption</strong>: The teacher shared that buying high-quality displays (Nano-texture display) and AirPods Pro 2 (with hearing aid function, about $249) is to protect health and improve the quality of life. These investments are worthwhile, and financial operations (such as secured loans, credit card rebates reinvestment) can be used to make them feel like &ldquo;no money is spent.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Defining Purchasing Power</strong>: True purchasing power means that when the purchased items (such as houses and cars) are accidentally damaged, you have the ability to easily buy another one without feeling financial pressure or heartache. Otherwise, you are exceeding your consumption capacity.</li>

<li>Sharing: Reviewed his 16-year investment journey: early purchases of 0050/0056 -&gt; chasing biotech stocks (heavy losses) -&gt; starting to invest in U.S. stocks (VOO/VTI/bonds, diversified) after the pandemic -&gt; epiphany after listening to the course, and is now concentrating assets into QQQ. Realized that dividends (0056) are not as good as total return (0050), paying off the mortgage too early was a wrong decision, and the cost of time is terrible.</li>
<li>Question 1: Should asset allocation (such as 442/433) be achieved on all accounts (Taiwan, US Brokerage, IRA, Roth 401k, etc.) as a whole, or should each account follow?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: All accounts should be regarded as a whole for allocation. Leveraged funds (such as QLD) can only be placed in tax-free growth Roth accounts. Cash can be placed in Brokerage or Traditional IRA/401k (doing so can slow down the growth of pre-tax accounts, which is beneficial for future taxes). The final Beta value will be limited by the size of the Roth account. Even if the Beta is lower than 1, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Stability (tortoise) may outperform aggression (hare).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: There are historical contributions in Traditional 401k (mutual funds have been converted to QQQ), and now it is a mix of Roth and Traditional. Should the Traditional portion be converted to Roth?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Whether to convert depends on the amount and current tax rate. If the amount is not large, you can convert it all at once. If the amount is large (e.g., 500,000), in order to avoid high tax burdens, it should be converted over many years. You can use the Investment Calculator to calculate how much amount to convert each year to reduce the Traditional balance to zero within a set period (e.g., 10 years) while controlling the annual tax burden. Fidelity clearly distinguishes the shares of Roth and Traditional internally.</li>

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Understanding and love</strong>: Understand the needs of family members and love them (love what they love). Meeting reasonable needs is part of maintaining family harmony.</li>
<li><strong>Smart consumption</strong>: Capitalists don&rsquo;t not consume, but consume smartly. Use financial tools (secured loans, adjusting investment portfolios such as selling QQQ for QLD + cash) to meet consumption needs as much as possible without affecting the compound growth of core assets.</li>
<li><strong>Balance</strong>: Find a balance between wealth accumulation and enjoyment of life. It is not necessary to meet all requirements, but it is not possible to completely reject them. It is necessary to meet one or two needs that family members value every year or every few years.</li>

Also shared how to use credit card payments to get 0% interest installments and then use the money to buy 00864B for arbitrage.</li>
<li>Question: Is this operation feasible? Does it conform to the 442 configuration idea?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Not 442</strong>: What you described is an arbitrage strategy, not the 442 asset allocation based on long-term growth that we discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Arbitrage efficiency</strong>: Putting borrowed money (cost 2.8%) into a NTD account with 2% interest is losing money. All of it should be put into 00864B with higher returns (about 4.5%) and matching currencies (USD) for arbitrage. Exchange rate fluctuations are not important.</li>
<li><strong>Credit card arbitrage</strong>: It is feasible to use 0% interest installments for arbitrage, but it is a &ldquo;sesame green bean&rdquo; small trick and should not be distracted too much.</li>

<li>Sharing: Experienced the 2008 financial crisis, assets were halved, and since then has attached importance to cash, maintaining 30-40% cash all year round. Dared to buy in when the market fell sharply in 2022 and made a profit at the end of the year.</li>
<li>Question 1: Made considerable profits last year and early this year and wanted to sell some at a high level to avoid a callback, but her husband prevented it because of concerns about high taxes (believing that it would push the tax bracket to 50%). How to deal with it?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Her husband&rsquo;s understanding of tax law is wrong. Long-term Capital Gain Tax is calculated separately from ordinary income tax. Its tax rate is tiered (usually 0%, 15%, 20%), and the highest is 20% (plus a possible 3.8% NIIT). Selling capital gains will not push ordinary income to an extremely high tax bracket (such as 50%). The tax rate for selling a lot of LTCG is basically fixed (it is 20% after reaching a certain amount). However, it is not recommended to time the market to sell. If you really want to operate, you should prioritize doing so in retirement accounts (such as IRA/401k). Selling has no immediate tax impact, and you can even buy reverse ETFs (such as SQQQ) for hedging in retirement accounts (advanced operation, not recommended).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Is it better to buy dividend-paying stocks or other things with the cash (Money Market) held? Worried about the tax on dividend-paying stocks.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Don&rsquo;t use dividend-paying stocks to hold cash, the tax efficiency is low. You should use money market funds. If you want to avoid both federal and state taxes, you can consider municipal bond funds (Muni Bond Fund, such as Vanguard&rsquo;s VOOX). If you only consider federal tax, you can use U.S. Treasury money market funds (such as SGOV, BIL). There is a capital gains tax problem only when selling.</li>

<li>Question 3: I want to anonymously sponsor a talented child (a friend&rsquo;s child, with decent family conditions), but I don&rsquo;t want the other party to know now, how to operate? Worried about tax issues.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Anonymous operation is difficult, especially involving opening an account. And the other party&rsquo;s family may not need sponsorship. A safer way is to write this child (providing name, address, and other information) into your own trust file as a beneficiary of future inheritance. This operation is simple and usually tax-free.</li>

<li>Question 1: In the United States, in addition to mortgage loans and stock pledges, what other similar low-cost sources of funds can be used like &ldquo;Han Xin counting soldiers&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: The U.S. financial market is highly efficient and has a lot of &ldquo;smart money,&rdquo; so the interest rate on unsecured personal loans is usually higher (such as 8% +). Unlike Taiwan, which has a large amount of low-cost funds (due to export-oriented currency abundance), there are indeed not many other low-cost, flexible sources of funds besides stock pledges (Pledge Loan). If you have channels in Taiwan to borrow low-interest NTD funds, you can consider it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Regarding children&rsquo;s college tuition fees, is it better for them to apply for student loans themselves (and we will use the pledged money to pay them back after graduation), or to pay directly with the pledged money? Which is better?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: There is no absolute right or wrong, it depends on the child&rsquo;s personality and feelings. If the child feels stressed about debt, pay directly. If the child understands financial leverage and the student loan conditions are favorable (such as interest only after graduation), you can let them take out the loan and the parents will pay it back later. The key is to communicate well with the child. The teacher shared his experience of paying his daughter&rsquo;s tuition fees directly.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Concerns about U.S. Treasury bonds (such as the debt-to-GDP ratio, interest burden), is it possible that the world will stop buying U.S. bonds?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: U.S. assets (168T) far exceed debt (federal debt 36T). The interest burden is controllable relative to fiscal revenue and GDP. Countries around the world hold a large amount of USD reserves and must purchase USD assets (government bonds, treasury bills, money market funds, etc.) to store them. There are no other large-scale options to replace them. Therefore, the world will not stop buying U.S. bonds. A strong U.S. dollar is in the best interest of the United States.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: The price of SGOV (short-term treasury bond ETF) is rising slightly every day, while the price of TLT (long-term treasury bond ETF) has been falling recently, why?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: SGOV tracks short-term interest rates. Its mechanism is to accrue interest accumulation daily and the net value returns after dividends, showing a step-like slight oscillation. TLT represents long-term treasury bonds, and its price (yield) mainly reflects the market&rsquo;s <strong>expectations for future long-term inflation</strong>. If the market expects inflation to rise in the future (for example, worrying about tariffs leading to inflation), the yield on long-term treasury bonds will rise and the price of TLT will fall. This has little to do with the Fed&rsquo;s current short-term interest rate policy.</li>

<p>In this CLEC investment and financial management sharing session, James reiterated the core philosophy of long-term investment: embrace market volatility, adhere to holding index funds represented by QQQ, and build firm belief through continuous learning. The teacher analyzed the real situation of U.S. Treasury bonds in detail, believing that there is no need to worry too much, and clarified the misunderstanding about its interest burden and Musk&rsquo;s criticism. At the same time, it discussed the rational use of leverage, the importance of cash reserves (like air and magic weapons), and how to overcome psychological biases in investment. The Q&amp;A session involved asset allocation across accounts, Roth conversion, real estate processing (including Canadian non-resident tax issues and personal experience), children&rsquo;s education funding planning, the excellent value and experience of Tesla FSD, consumption concept balance (smart consumption vs. laborer thinking), the limited sources of low-cost funds in the United States, the driving factor differences between long-term and short-term treasury bond ETFs, and the correct understanding of U.S. long-term capital gains tax and other practical issues, providing specific operational suggestions and thinking frameworks. The core message is to maintain a long-term perspective, make rational decisions, use financial tools to achieve a balance between wealth growth and quality of life, while understanding and respecting the needs of the people around you.</p>

<p>This session centers around the importance of psychological resilience in investing. James&rsquo;s core message is that mental strength is the key to investment success, while other skills and calculations are secondary. Investors need to maintain a highly optimistic mindset, viewing market fluctuations as opportunities rather than crises in the long run. Long-term investing, rational analysis, and maintaining a healthy mindset are more crucial than striving for precise calculations.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Correction on 401(k) and IRA:</strong> James corrects a statement from the previous session regarding 401(k) and IRA contribution limits, clarifying that the limits for each are independent, but that IRAs have income restrictions. He provides further explanations about the Backdoor Roth IRA conversion, advising listeners to manage pre-tax and after-tax funds carefully to avoid account confusion and complications during tax filing.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation Strategy:</strong> He emphasizes the significance of asset allocation and suggests listeners refer to existing articles and Excel spreadsheets for simulations, discouraging impulsive decision-making. He offers various asset allocation plans catering to different risk tolerances and retirement stages, stressing the concept of &ldquo;fuzzy accuracy&rdquo; – that it is not necessary to pursue overly precise ratios, but ensuring sufficient cash reserves is crucial. Example: A listener proposes an allocation of 60% QQQ and 40% cash, which James believes carries a risk of bankruptcy and advises them to consult the provided asset allocation plans.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraged ETFs and Rebalancing:</strong> Using QQQ&rsquo;s beta value of 1.0 as a benchmark, he simplifies beta calculations for leveraged ETFs, for instance, QLD is considered 2.0. He recommends a gradual approach when adjusting beta during rebalancing, advising against drastic changes. For investors with earned income, the frequency and ratio of rebalancing can be more flexible. Example: He suggests that young investors can rotate investments among QQQ, QLD, and TQQQ every six months, then rebalance at the end of the year.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Investing and Market Volatility:</strong> James reiterates the importance of long-term investing, using the dot-com bubble of 2000 as an example to demonstrate that long-term investors ultimately profit, even after enduring prolonged market downturns. Market dips are opportunities, and investors should remain optimistic, buying whenever they have funds available. He refutes the notion that &ldquo;investments in 2000 took 15 years to break even,&rdquo; emphasizing that the market always recovers in the long run. Example: An investment of $5 million at the peak of the market in 2000, despite experiencing the burst of the internet bubble, would still have grown to $32.375 million by 2024.</li>
<li><strong>Brokerage Selection:</strong> He advises choosing brokerages with physical branch offices and understanding how stocks and cash are held in custody to ensure asset security. Example: He explains the risks of nominee accounts and recommends selecting brokerages that allow for direct ownership of stocks, encouraging listeners to inquire about the brokerage&rsquo;s custodian banks for stocks and cash.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose of Holding Cash:</strong> He underlines that cash holdings are meant for emergencies and to seize buying opportunities during market downturns, not for pursuing interest income. Example: He suggests maintaining a 20% cash position, a portion of which can be utilized for adding to leveraged ETFs during dips.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Target Selection:</strong> He recommends selecting suitable investment targets based on individual circumstances. For instance, retirees or individuals with limited funds may consider high-dividend ETFs, while younger individuals or those with ample funds should focus on growth-oriented ETFs like QQQ. Example: Addressing a listener holding SCH, James advises them to assess whether high-dividend ETFs are appropriate based on their asset level and annual expenses.</li>

<p><strong>Danny:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shares: He has been following James&rsquo;s investment strategy for three years and achieved a return of approximately 35%.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chang&rsquo;an:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Brokerage security and recommendations in Hong Kong.</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Choose brokerages with physical branch offices in the region, understand the custodian banks for stocks and cash, and avoid easily dissolved online brokerages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shares: He began investing during the pandemic, experienced the hardships of short-term trading, and eventually recognized the importance of long-term investing and psychological control. He uses the example of Jesse Livermore to illustrate the risks of trading.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jessie:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shares: Both she and her husband are nearing 60 years old, and a portion of their investment funds comes from a mortgage loan. She expresses concerns about a potential market crash and the risk of USD devaluation.</li>
<li>Questions:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>How to cope with a possible future market crash, especially with a mortgage due before retirement?</li>
<li>What about USD devaluation?</li>
<li>Are there risks associated with concentrating large sums of money in a single brokerage account?</li>
<li>Is it feasible to refinance the mortgage in five years or repay it early with funds from the investment account?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The market is unlikely to experience losses within a 15-year timeframe. Ensure you can comfortably handle mortgage payments for the next 13 years; the most secure approach is to sell the house and repay the loan.</li>
<li>He declines to answer hypothetical questions.</li>
<li>Stocks are registered under the investor&rsquo;s name, hence the risk of brokerage failure is manageable.</li>
<li>Refinancing or early repayment is not recommended. Excessive focus on short-term interest gains is akin to &ldquo;penny wise, pound foolish,&rdquo; and ultimately increases risk.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shares: He went all-in on QQQ, but after some short-term trading, realized it wasn&rsquo;t suitable for him and experienced psychological pressure due to large position fluctuations.</li>
<li>Question: How to overcome the psychological pressure brought about by fluctuations in a large portfolio?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Focus on realized gains rather than unrealized gains.</li>
<li>Maintain 20% cash and 20% leveraged ETFs to stabilize your mindset.</li>
<li>Exercise caution with short-term trading, as it may not be sustainable in the long run.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Haoqing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shares: He uses examples of friends gambling and raising children to illustrate the importance of moderate expectations and nurturing interests. He compares and contrasts education philosophies and Nobel Prize achievements between China and the US, emphasizing the significance of financial freedom for the next generation.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Mental fortitude is the equipment for investing, it determines whether you will succeed.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Investment skills and calculations are undoubtedly important, but psychological resilience is the ultimate factor that decides investment success. Even for simple index fund investing, a sound mental state is needed to navigate market volatility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A market downturn is not a disaster, it&rsquo;s an opportunity.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a long-term investment perspective, market downturns provide excellent opportunities to acquire high-quality assets.  Maintain a long-term outlook and don&rsquo;t be intimidated by short-term fluctuations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There should be a limit to human pessimism.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excessive pessimism and worry are detrimental to investments. One should rationally analyze risks and develop sensible coping strategies. Do not let extreme scenarios or low-probability events unduly influence investment decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Parents sometimes have these expectations for their children, don&rsquo;t impose your unfulfilled aspirations on them.
&ndash; Haoqing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Parents should respect their children&rsquo;s individuality and interests and refrain from forcing their own unaccomplished goals onto them. Allowing children to have a joyful childhood and the autonomy to choose their own paths in life is more important than chasing conventional success.</p>
