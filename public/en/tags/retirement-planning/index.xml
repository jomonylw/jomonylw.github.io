      <description>In this episode, Teacher James first shares his personal health experience in treating sleep apnea, followed by another strong warning about the huge risks for non-US tax residents investing in the US, including the 40% estate tax and account freezing issues. The teacher provides a detailed analysis of the dividend composition of the high-dividend ETF QQQI, and expounds on the rebalancing strategy for the 433 asset allocation after asset growth, emphasizing the core principle of &amp;#39;borrowing without repaying&amp;#39; in stock pledging. The Q&amp;amp;A session delves into asset allocation, investment mindset shifts, and the impact of the AI era on social structure.</description>

<p>The core of this classroom session lies in reiterating and deepening the channel&rsquo;s highest guiding principle of investment: &ldquo;Buy whenever you have money, never sell.&rdquo; Through specific cases and analyses, Teacher James emphasizes the inevitability of long-term holding of high-quality assets represented by the Nasdaq 100 Index. At the same time, he dissects in detail the potential huge risks for non-US residents investing in the US, and provides clear strategic guidance on how to use stock pledging and high-dividend ETFs to build a stable retirement cash flow, aiming to help investors establish a financial system that allows them to enjoy life with peace of mind without being anxious about market fluctuations.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Problem &amp; Harm</strong>: Teacher James had long been troubled by snoring problems and later realized their severity. Snoring (Sleep Apnea) leads to reduced blood oxygen concentration at night (he personally dropped as low as 83%). Long-term effects can trigger health risks such as insulin resistance, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, and even dementia.</li>
<li><strong>Treatment Plan</strong>: Through a dentist specializing in sleep therapy (Dr. Hsu at Caipin Dental Clinic), he underwent corrective treatment using a customized oral appliance (mouthpiece). The cost was about 50,000 to 60,000 TWD. This method does not require surgery and is suitable for moderate-level problems.</li>
<li><strong>Significant Results</strong>: After treatment, sleep quality improved drastically, and snoring almost completely disappeared. Comparing data from the <code>SnoreLab</code> App and <code>Apple Watch</code>: before treatment, snoring time accounted for 17% of sleep time with frequent awakenings; after treatment, the snoring ratio dropped to 0-1%, with continuous and deep sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Advice</strong>: The teacher suggests that friends with similar troubles take this issue seriously. You can use apps like <code>SnoreLab</code> for preliminary detection and consult professional sleep specialists; dental correction might be a relatively simple initial solution.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Core Warning</strong>: Teacher James, in a very serious tone, emphasized again that <strong>Non-US tax residents (those without US citizenship or Green Card) must absolutely not open accounts with US brokerages (such as Schwab, IBKR, Fidelity, etc.) to invest or buy real estate in their personal names.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Three Core Risks</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>High Estate Tax</strong>: Once the asset owner passes away, their assets in the US will face an estate tax of up to 40%.</li>
<li><strong>Account Freezing Risk</strong>: US financial regulation is very strict, and accounts can be frozen at any time for various reasons. For example:
<ul>
<li>The bank cannot contact the person (emails bounced, phone numbers invalid).</li>
<li>The actual flow of funds in the account does not match the purpose declared at opening (e.g., large investment sums moving in and out of an account declared for living expenses).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Extremely Complex Inheritance Procedures</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The inheritance process is cumbersome, requiring a large number of documents like death certificates and household registers, which need notarization and English translation, and finally authentication by the US Consulate in the local area.</li>
<li>Inheritance requires going through the US court&rsquo;s &ldquo;Probate&rdquo; process, taking at least six months or more.</li>
<li>Heirs usually need to hire US lawyers to handle it, which is costly and complex, potentially leading family members to give up inheritance, resulting in the assets vanishing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is absolutely no need to take this risk. Investors should buy ETF products tracking the Nasdaq 100 Index through local brokerages in their own country or region.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dividend Source Structure</strong>: QQQI&rsquo;s dividends do not rely entirely on profit distributions from constituent companies. Its composition is relatively complex and stable, coming mainly from three aspects:
<ol>
<li><strong>Actual Dividends</strong>: Dividends distributed by the 80% QQQ it holds.</li>
<li><strong>Option Strategy Income</strong>: Income (premiums) generated by selling Covered Calls and Call Spreads. This part of the income is usually correlated with central bank interest rate levels.</li>
<li><strong>Rebalancing &amp; Stabilization Fund</strong>: When the held QQQ appreciates significantly due to market rise, fund managers will sell a portion of the stocks to convert profits into cash, used to distribute dividends stably, acting similarly to a stabilization fund.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Purpose &amp; Trade-off</strong>: The goal of QQQI is to provide investors with stable, predictable cash flow. To achieve this, it sacrifices some capital appreciation (since it only holds 80% of QQQ, its Beta is about 0.8). Its total return will be slightly lower than QQQ, but for retirees who need stable living expenses, this is worth it.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rebalancing After Asset Appreciation</strong>: When assets using the 433 allocation grow significantly (e.g., from $1 million to $5 million), the &ldquo;autopilot system&rdquo; can be reset to improve quality of life.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Assets at 5 million, existing loan at 250k. You can take 500k (twice the loan amount) from the 5 million and put it into a Money Market Fund as a new cash reserve. The remaining 4.5 million is then allocated via 433. This way, annual disposable living expenses can be calculated at 2% of the new total asset value, i.e., $100,000 (5M * 2%), significantly improving quality of life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Core Principle of Stock Pledging: Borrow But Do Not Repay</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Wrong Operation</strong>: <strong>Absolutely do not use your cash reserves (Money Market Fund) to repay the stock pledge loan.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reason</strong>: Once you use cash to repay, your asset allocation ratio is destroyed. The reduction in the cash portion causes the risk (Beta) of the entire portfolio to rise from the original 0.9 to 1.11, significantly increasing volatility and violating the original intention of asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Mindset</strong>: People who pledge stocks should &ldquo;ignore interest.&rdquo; Because the interest generated by your cash portion (e.g., 3%) and the returns generated by the investment portion (e.g., 15%) are far higher than the loan interest you pay (e.g., 6-7%). The core function of cash reserves is for rebalancing during market downturns, not for repayment.</li>

<li><strong>Share</strong>: Previously, her husband was very conflicted about how to build a position, but recently finally allocated all funds. After completion, the whole person became calm and reassured. Family financial anxiety disappeared, and they felt unprecedented freedom. They no longer feel guilty about spending, nor do they feel the need to sell more physical labor (like part-time jobs) to make money. Quality of life and mindset have improved greatly.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Comment</strong>: This is exactly the goal of our channel—to let everyone have peace of mind and not be trapped by money. The purpose of life is not to work, but to enjoy life.

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: After retirement, there are still individual stocks with high profits accounting for about ten-plus percent of total assets (such as Tesla, Google, Microsoft) in the account. How should they be handled?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: There are two options.
<ol>
<li><strong>Sell Immediately</strong>: Sell it all at once and pay the 15% long-term capital gains tax. The advantage is it&rsquo;s simple and done once and for all.</li>
<li><strong>Sell in Batches</strong>: Wait until the Roth Conversion is fully completed in 7-8 years. When personal income decreases, sell stocks in batches annually utilizing the tax-free allowance for long-term capital gains (about $60,000 for singles, deducting Social Security and other income) to save on taxes. But this method is more troublesome. The teacher leans towards the first option for simplicity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Due to high taxes and health insurance payments after retirement, annual expenses have increased, causing total assets to be slightly lower than 33 times annual expenses. Can stock pledging still be done?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: Absolutely. You can still borrow via pledging to pay taxes and living expenses. If the required withdrawal ratio is higher than the standard 2% of the 433 allocation, you can adjust the asset allocation appropriately. For example, increase the proportion of high-dividend QQQI in the retirement account. QQQI will generate stable cash flow to replenish your cash pool, which effectively lowers the risk (Beta) of the entire portfolio, thereby allowing you to safely increase the borrowing ratio (e.g., up to 3%).</li>

<li><strong>Share</strong>: After learning investment concepts, her mindset underwent a huge shift. She no longer bargains when buying things but feels grateful to merchants, practicing the mindset of a &ldquo;rich person.&rdquo; She started teaching her children to save from a young age and invest in 00662 (Nasdaq 100 ETF in Taiwan stocks), using incentives to encourage them to save. She also shared her experience of spreading these concepts to friends, realizing that everyone&rsquo;s timing for &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo; is different, but insisting on planting seeds always brings hope.

<li><strong>Share</strong>: As a doctor, he provided professional supplementation on the sleep apnea mentioned by Teacher James. He explained the three types: obstructive, central, and mixed, emphasized long-term harms (such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s), and introduced different treatment methods, including oral appliances, CPAP machines, surgery, etc. He advised people with symptoms to see a doctor.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Comment</strong>: Thanks to Dr. Henry for the professional addition, and emphasized again that everyone should take this issue seriously and seek professional medical help.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong> (Asked by Su): A friend used a CPAP machine for a year and the problem was solved, but recently the doctor asked him to use it again. Why?
<ul>
<li><strong>Dr. Henry&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: CPAP is assisted breathing and usually cannot cure the disease itself unless the problem was caused by obesity and weight loss was successful. If weight rebounds, the problem may recur. If symptoms persist, continuous use or other treatment options like surgery are needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong> (Asked by Houqin): If surgery is needed, what specific part is treated?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: (Answering briefly on behalf) Generally, it involves removing excess soft tissue in the throat to widen the airway. However, the specific situation is very professional, and it is recommended to consult a specialist directly.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: As a new investor from mainland China, with total assets of about 700k RMB dispersed across IB, domestic brokerages, and HSBC Hong Kong. Since the asset amount is small, is asset allocation necessary? How should the leverage part be operated?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Account Adjustment</strong>: You should transfer assets from IB to HSBC Hong Kong as soon as possible to avoid US estate tax and account risks.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation</strong>: You can buy the Nasdaq 100 2x Leveraged ETF listed in Hong Kong via HSBC, but the leveraged position should not exceed 20% of total assets. Before starting to pledge for living expenses, there is no need to frequently rebalance the leverage part.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Position</strong>: For the cash part in the Hong Kong account, you can consult HSBC to see which money market funds (such as CSOP US Dollar Money Market Fund, 9096 or 3096) are eligible for pledging.</li>

<li><strong>Share</strong>: Shared a story about a Cuban contractor friend who brought his entire family of 27 to the US, bearing all expenses alone, facing huge financial pressure, reflecting the complexity of immigration issues.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: Since the investment portfolio (QQQ, QLD, Cash) itself generates dividends and interest, and these cash flows might already be enough for living, why not use this money directly instead of borrowing and paying interest?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: This is a core conceptual error. <strong>Absolutely do not spend your own money (including dividends and interest)!</strong> Your money is a &ldquo;Golden Goose&rdquo; that can generate money and should be continuously invested in the market to obtain an annualized return of about 15%. The cost of borrowing is only 6-7%. Spending your own dividends is equivalent to giving up higher returns, which is not cost-effective at all.</li>

<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: After entering the AI society, with a large population unemployed, how will they consume without income? How will society function?

A large unemployed population will be &ldquo;kept/fed&rdquo; (like in a zoo), with basic food, clothing, housing, and transportation guaranteed by surplus products created by AI, but they will have no right to choose. Capitalists who own assets (us investors) can use wealth to buy scarce resources and services, living a life of free choice. From a grander philosophical level, humanity&rsquo;s historical mission might be to nurture AI, a higher species, as our &ldquo;next generation.&rdquo;</li>

<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: This is indeed unusual. According to passive index rules, the company with the smallest market cap is usually removed. Removing a company with a high market cap ranking might involve human judgment, which contradicts the concept of a passive index. The teacher stated that further research into the specific reasons is needed, but this does not affect our long-term confidence in the index.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Share 1</strong>: Shared the experience of his friend within the &ldquo;system&rdquo; in China. Because this friend could not bypass the firewall to get outside information, he listened to his wife and invested in Chinese real estate, resulting in assets falling from a peak of nearly 60 million RMB to less than 20 million; meanwhile, the portion invested in 513100 (A-share Nasdaq ETF) following Mike&rsquo;s advice performed excellently, forming a sharp contrast. This highlights the importance of accessing correct information and cognition.</li>
<li><strong>Share 2</strong>: Shared that his doctor friend was skeptical about Google AlphaFold (protein folding prediction), arguing that &ldquo;humans can&rsquo;t even synthesize artificial starch, how can they analyze all proteins.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: These are two completely unrelated things. One cannot use a bottleneck in one field to negate a breakthrough in another.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Investing makes you wealthy, but borrowing makes you a tycoon.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When answering student Lily&rsquo;s question about &ldquo;what he would say to his younger self if he could go back,&rdquo; the teacher emphasized the huge amplifying effect of using leverage early on for wealth growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have stock pledging, don&rsquo;t spend a single dime of your own assets. Why spend your own money? Your money can be invested for a 15% return, while borrowing only costs you 6% or 7%.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: In response to student Houqin&rsquo;s question about &ldquo;why not live off dividends instead of borrowing,&rdquo; the teacher hit the nail on the head regarding the opportunity cost of spending dividends, which is the core logic of the stock pledging strategy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not borrowing is where the risk lies; borrowing is actually lower risk.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Re-emphasizing that borrowing (pledging) under reasonable allocation carries lower risk than using principal (including dividends), because the latter destroys asset allocation and increases portfolio volatility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We rely on the 100 strongest companies in the US; there is no investment more stable than this.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When commenting on student Laurence&rsquo;s share, the teacher explained the source of confidence in investing in the Nasdaq 100 Index: trusting the long-term creativity of the top tier of human enterprises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are not a US tax resident; do not open an account with a US brokerage to invest, and do not buy assets in the US. Understood?
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: The teacher used an extremely serious and repetitive tone to emphasize the severe risks of direct investment in the US for non-US residents. This is an important reminder for all overseas investors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, after putting all my funds into QQQ with these asset allocations, I have &lsquo;done what had to be done, subject to no further becoming&rsquo; (所作已办，不受后有). That is, there will be no more troubles of greed, anger, and ignorance following me.
&ndash; Lily</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Lily shared her understanding of the teacher&rsquo;s &ldquo;Formless Investment&rdquo; philosophy, combining it with the Buddhist state of liberation from afflictions, vividly describing the inner peace brought by index investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We humans are not born to work&hellip; slowly let money work for us, so we can retire with stability and live what we call freedom.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: The teacher encouraged the student couple, explaining that the true meaning of financial freedom is liberating time and life to do what one truly wants, rather than being burdened by work for a lifetime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I am old, when I become a grandmother&hellip; I want to be a rich grandma.
&ndash; Shu</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Shu shared her beautiful vision for the future, hoping that through investment, she will not only make herself wealthy but also benefit her descendants, becoming a generous elder with financial confidence.</p>

<p>This episode, ranging from personal health to global macroeconomics, from practical investment to philosophy of life, once again builds a complete and firm investment worldview for us. Teacher James&rsquo; core message remains consistent: find and stick to the simplest and most essential investment truth—<strong>long-term holding and complete trust in index funds composed of top enterprises.</strong> He not only provided the methodology of &ldquo;what to do&rdquo; (buy indices) and &ldquo;how to do it&rdquo; (asset allocation and pledging) but, more importantly, by repeatedly emphasizing the investment risks for non-US residents and the importance of mindset construction, he cleared the most dangerous traps and common ideological obstacles on our investment path. Whether new investors or senior students, everyone can find the guidance and confidence needed for their current stage in this episode, eventually walking towards the path of financial freedom with peace of mind.</p>

      <description>This episode marks the first class of 2026. Teacher James first emphasized the importance of positive thinking and positive language for life and investing, believing that human intention combines with cosmic fluctuations to create one&amp;#39;s reality. He then detailed a major update to the backtesting tool, specifically changing the calculation benchmark from &amp;#39;monthly closing price&amp;#39; to &amp;#39;monthly lowest price,&amp;#39; and explained the impact of this on leverage ratios for US market asset allocation. The sharing session covered various topics including investment mindset, asset allocation strategies, retirement planning (retiring with 15x annual expenses), overseas asset selection, and coping with geopolitical risks. The content is rich and practical.</description>

<p>The core of this episode focuses on two main areas: First, emphasizing <strong>mindset building for investment and life</strong>, specifically shaping one&rsquo;s wealth and happiness through &ldquo;positive affirmations&rdquo; and extreme optimism. Second, sharing <strong>updates on investment tools and strategy optimization</strong>, particularly the algorithm modification of the backtesting tool and its impact on leverage allocation. It also deeply explores the feasibility of achieving early retirement (15x annual expenses) by combining high-dividend products (like QQQI) with growth assets (like QQQ).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Power of Positive Intention</strong>: Teacher James opened by emphasizing that our lives and the world are created by our thoughts (brainwaves). One must say positive things to oneself daily, such as &ldquo;I am the best,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am rich,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am happy.&rdquo; By irrigating the subconscious, we attract positive energy, thereby transforming the external environment into what we desire. This applies not only to investing but to life as a whole.</li>
<li><strong>No-Brainer Investing</strong>: Investing in index funds should adopt a &ldquo;no-brainer investment method,&rdquo; ignoring short-term market turbulence, international situations, economic analysis, and financial reports. Admitting one&rsquo;s &ldquo;incompetence&rdquo; in predicting the market allows one to easily obtain long-term market returns.</li>
<li><strong>Information Channels</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Given the excessive ads in some YouTube videos (like 00451), it is suggested that students switch to <strong>Podcast</strong> or <strong>Himalaya</strong> platforms for listening.</li>
<li>A friend from China (Tree Kevin/Da Shu Kevin) has migrated the audio content to Himalaya, making it convenient for students in mainland China to listen.</li>
<li>All important information and links have been summarized in the &ldquo;<strong>Newcomer&rsquo;s Sunflower Bible</strong>&rdquo; for easy reference.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Major Update to Backtesting Tool</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Logic Modification</strong>: When calculating the maintenance ratio, the backtesting tool has changed the data benchmark from the previous &ldquo;<strong>monthly closing price</strong>&rdquo; to the &ldquo;<strong>monthly lowest price</strong>.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Reason for Modification</strong>: In the actual market, asset prices may hit a low point mid-month (e.g., on the 8th or 15th), triggering a Margin Call (liquidation), without waiting for the month-end close. Therefore, using the lowest price for backtesting aligns better with realistic risks.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Asset Allocation</strong>: This change does not affect the 80/20 allocation in Taiwan, but it impacts <strong>US market asset allocation</strong>. The previous 2.0x leverage (pledge loan accounting for 20% of total assets) would fail in worst-case scenarios and <strong>needs to be lowered to 1.9x</strong> (i.e., borrowing a maximum of $19,000 against $100,000 in assets).</li>
<li><strong>Tool Access and Usage</strong>: New tool instructions, engine explanations, and GitHub source code links have been provided. Users in mainland China who cannot access Vercel can download the source code via GitHub and use it offline in a local Docker environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rebalancing Strategy Details</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart Rebalancing</strong>: Switching between Cash and QLD.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Rebalancing</strong>: Divided into two scenarios.
<ol>
<li><strong>Insufficient Cash</strong>: During a decline, transfer a portion of QQQ to QLD without consuming cash.</li>
<li><strong>Sufficient Cash</strong>: Further divided into two modes:
<ul>
<li><strong>Defensive</strong>: Buy with cash when the market falls; switch between Cash and QLD when the market rises.</li>
<li><strong>Aggressive</strong>: Buy with cash when the market falls; when the market rises, sell QLD and convert directly to QQQ instead of cash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cash Management Strategy</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Teacher James personally holds <strong>almost zero cash</strong>. Daily expenses are covered by pledge loans borrowed only when needed (e.g., the day before credit card payments).</li>
<li>Idle cash should be invested in cash-equivalent assets, such as US BOX (BIL/SGOV/SHV) or Taiwan&rsquo;s 00865B, and sold only when money is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Critique of Insurance</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The teacher believes that buying insurance is a form of laziness and inertia, an attempt to transfer risk to insurance companies. He refers to insurance companies as &ldquo;<strong>poverty manufacturing machines</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>viruses of society</strong>,&rdquo; considering the financial industry to be &ldquo;licensed scam groups&rdquo; that investors should not rely on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Asset and ETF Information</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-US Assets</strong>: Provided XNAS, CNDX, EQAC, EQQQ, etc., as references, which may not be subject to US estate tax.</li>
<li><strong>Hong Kong High-Dividend Alternatives</strong>: 3451 or 9451 can serve as alternatives to QQQI; 3416 can also be considered.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: As a young person in Japan, if I use a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) and credit to invest in a Japanese Nasdaq 100 index fund, what should I do if the Yen appreciates significantly later (e.g., from 157 to 100)?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: Absolutely no problem. Your income is in Yen, and your loan is in Yen. As long as your salary is sufficient to cover the monthly loan payments, there is no need to worry. Stock and exchange rate fluctuations are irrelevant to you because you do not need to sell stocks to repay the debt. Even if there is a 30% loss in exchange rates, two years of stock market gains will be enough to cover it, so there is no need for concern.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: She began living a retirement life in July 2025 using the method taught by the teacher (about 25x annual expenses), traveling everywhere. She found that the &ldquo;two-track parallel&rdquo; approach (part high-dividend + part growth) she adopted at the time coincides with the teacher&rsquo;s recently shared strategy of &ldquo;retiring with 15-20x annual expenses.&rdquo; She personally verified that this retirement lifestyle is very comfortable and free, and that assets continue to grow while being withdrawn, truly experiencing the feeling of &ldquo;endless money.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Comment</strong>: Excellent! Lulin has reached the highest realm of financial and personal freedom, able to go anywhere she pleases. This proves the feasibility of the 15x annual expense retirement plan.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Share 1</strong>: Regarding purchasing Nasdaq funds in Hong Kong to avoid US estate tax, he summarized from personal experience that iShares <strong>2834</strong> is the best choice. It is registered in Hong Kong and adopts a dividend reinvestment strategy (has never paid dividends since listing in 2016), effectively avoiding CRS tax issues. In contrast, KQQM carries estate tax risks, and 3086 pays dividends which trigger CRS reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Share 2</strong>: He has helped many Clubhouse students gratuitously by sharing information on Hong Kong investments.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: He has an undeveloped idea: Can he take a portion of assets to buy QQQI to cover all living expenses with its dividends, then put all remaining assets into QQQ (2834), keeping no cash, and handling emergencies via pledge loans?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: No. This approach is very high risk. Apart from QQQI, the other portion of growth assets <strong>still needs to maintain a cash position</strong> (e.g., a 70% QQQ + 30% Cash allocation). There are two reasons: 1. Psychological stability; having cash prevents panic when the market drops 80%. 2. Dealing with emergencies. If a large sum of money is suddenly needed while the market is falling, taking out a pledge loan at that time is very dangerous. Without a cash buffer, you might be forced to sell assets at a low point or face the risk of liquidation. Keeping 30% cash, whether to use directly or as backing for a pledge, is much safer.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: She hasn&rsquo;t retired yet and doesn&rsquo;t need cash flow. She found through software backtesting that a 4-3-3 allocation (Beta 1.0) performs better than 8:2. Can she adopt the 4-3-3 allocation and open the pledge function at the bank, but temporarily not borrow money (incurring no interest), solely for use when she retires in the future?
<ul>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: Plans to move to Las Vegas (no state tax) after retirement. Her current state has a 6.8% state tax. Considering the federal tax rate might rise from 35% to 37% after retirement, should she do a Roth Conversion now or wait until after moving?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: <strong>Convert as early as possible.</strong> Because money in the IRA will continue to grow; 100k not converted this year might become 120k next year, increasing both the total amount to convert and the tax due in the future. The state tax saved by waiting is far less than the future tax burden brought by asset growth within the account. Additionally, it is suggested she sell her current car, take the cash to Las Vegas, and buy a new Tesla with a loan, allowing the cash to be used for investment.</li>

<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: <strong>You must fix the house up before you can sell it quickly.</strong> Especially for major flaws like leaks; no one wants to buy without repairs. Selling a house is not about selling for a &ldquo;high price,&rdquo; but being able to &ldquo;sell it.&rdquo; The price is determined by the market, not the seller. Repairs should be done immediately, and it should be sold upon receiving the first reasonable offer, because the time cost of delay is high. That money can create more returns once invested in the market sooner.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: Due to business needs, he borrowed a high-interest (11-12%) Margin Loan from a brokerage. He went to Schwab to switch to a lower-interest Pledge Loan (PAL) but was told he could only choose one. However, the financial specialist helped him significantly lower the Margin rate to &ldquo;Federal Rate + 2.25%&rdquo; (approx. 6%). He asks, in this situation, is it better to use the high-flexibility but high-risk Margin Loan, or apply for PAL?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: This is correct information. Margin Loans come from brokers, PALs come from Bankers; the risk mechanisms differ. A Margin Call can happen instantly and sell at the lowest point, whereas PAL has a certain buffer time. Money borrowed via Margin can be reinvested in stocks, while PAL funds usually cannot. Therefore, Margin is more flexible but also carries higher risk.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: He runs his own business and has 100k TWD in monthly passive rental income, basically covering living expenses and mortgage. He just obtained a 5 million TWD credit line (interest approx. 2.5%) in Taiwan and applied for a 200k USD loan in Singapore (also approx. 2.5%, but with the condition of purchasing the bank&rsquo;s wealth management products). How should he use these funds? Put a lump sum into QQQ/QQQI, or invest in his own business?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: 1. <strong>Do not take the Singapore loan</strong>, avoid any loan that comes with conditions to buy their wealth management products. 2. The 5 million TWD credit should be <strong>fully invested in the stock market (e.g., 00662)</strong> and absolutely not invested in your own business, to diversify risk and avoid putting all eggs in one basket. 3. The prerequisite for borrowing is that repayment must come from stable business cash flow, not the already occupied rental income. 4. As a young person in the asset accumulation phase, you should invest in <strong>growth assets (00662)</strong>, not dividend-paying types like QQQI.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: Does the &ldquo;15-year living expense retirement method&rdquo; (10 years expenses in QQQI, 5 years expenses in 4-3-3 allocation) mentioned by the teacher only apply to retirees? Can those still accumulating assets allocate based on this ratio (e.g., 2/3 QQQI, 1/3 Growth)?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: <strong>Young people in the asset accumulation phase must absolutely not touch high-dividend products like QQQI.</strong> Your goal is to pursue maximized growth. QQQI is prepared for retirees who need cash flow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Her family is afraid of QQQ volatility and feels safer with QQQI&rsquo;s monthly dividends. What should she do?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: If the money belongs to the family and investing in QQQI is the only way they can accept, then so be it. At least it&rsquo;s better than not investing, though it&rsquo;s not the optimal strategy. QQQI&rsquo;s own volatility (Beta 1.0) is as high as QQQ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: Does QQQI have tax issues in Taiwan?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: It falls under overseas income. Within 1 million TWD annual income requires no filing; over 1 million requires filing, but the basic exemption is very high (7.5 million), so average people don&rsquo;t need to worry about paying taxes.</li>

Trading risk is high, and you should <strong>absolutely never use Market Orders</strong>. Unless there is an extremely urgent reason, avoid trading after hours.

<p>This viewpoint emphasizes the creative power of thought and language, believing that one can actively shape their reality and financial status through positive self-suggestion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Buying insurance is laziness, it is inertia. You are essentially trying to transfer risk to the insurance company&hellip; Insurance companies are poverty manufacturing machines, viruses of society.

<p>The teacher criticizes the role of traditional insurance in financial management with very sharp language, believing it is not an effective tool for wealth growth and may instead erode assets.</p>
<blockquote>

&ndash; Meihao &amp; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This dialogue highlights how individuals should assess their actions when facing macro, uncontrollable risks. Instead of over-planning and agonizing over low-probability events, it is better to make the most basic and practical preparations (such as keeping passports valid).</p>

      <description>In this episode, Teacher James proposes a more achievable retirement plan, suggesting that assets equal to 15 times annual expenses are sufficient for retirement. He explains in detail how to use high-dividend products (such as QQQI) and traditional index portfolios to achieve this goal, and updates the asset allocation simulation tool, sharing simulation results for investors in Taiwan and the US. Additionally, the content covers cash management and ETF selection options for non-US tax residents in mainland China, Hong Kong, and elsewhere. The Q&amp;amp;A session delves into hot topics such as financial education for children, stock pledging strategies, and local investment practices.</description>

<p>The core theme of this episode is <strong>&ldquo;Redefining the Retirement Threshold.&rdquo;</strong> Teacher James overturns the traditional notion that one needs assets equal to 50 times their annual expenses to retire. Instead, he proposes a more positive and feasible plan: <strong>Retirement is possible with assets equal to just 15 times your annual expenses.</strong> The core of this plan lies in cleverly combining the stable cash flow provided by high-dividend ETFs with the appreciation potential of growth-oriented index investing. This significantly lowers the financial threshold for retirement, opening up the possibility of early retirement for more people. At the same time, the course updates the practical asset allocation simulation tool and provides specific investment tool recommendations for investors in different regions.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Core Strategy</strong>: Divide assets equivalent to 15 times annual expenses into two parts:
<ol>
<li><strong>10x Annual Expenses</strong>: Invest in high-dividend products to generate an annualized dividend of approximately 12% as stable cash flow to cover living expenses.</li>
<li><strong>5x Annual Expenses</strong>: Invest in a growth-oriented investment portfolio (such as the 433 allocation) to allow assets to continue growing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>High-Dividend Tool Recommendations</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>USA</strong>: QQQI, with an annualized dividend yield of about 12%.</li>
<li><strong>Taiwan</strong>: Can purchase QQQI via sub-brokerage (复委托).</li>
<li><strong>China</strong>: CSOP Huatai-PineBridge CSI Dividend Low Volatility ETF (008163).</li>
<li><strong>Hong Kong</strong>: Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (3416.HK), currently with a dividend yield as high as 16%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advantages</strong>: This plan makes retirement goals feel less distant, as investors don&rsquo;t need to wait until they accumulate 30 or 50 times their annual expenses. Fund managers handle the professional operations (such as selling stocks or utilizing options to generate income), providing investors with stable cash flow and shielding them from the direct psychological impact of market volatility.</li>

<ul>
<li>Can withdraw a maximum of <strong>2.5%</strong> for living expenses annually without margin calls (liquidation).</li>

<li><strong>US Investors (Pledging LTV ~80%)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Can withdraw a maximum of <strong>2.1%</strong> for living expenses annually.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Non-Pledgers (80/20 Allocation)</strong>:

<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Distinguish Consumption Types</strong>: Teach children from a young age to distinguish between &ldquo;spiritual consumption&rdquo; (e.g., travel, experiences) and &ldquo;material consumption&rdquo; (e.g., toys, brand names). Encourage the former, moderate the latter.</li>
<li><strong>Define Ownership</strong>: Clearly tell children that the money belongs to the parents, not them. Parents have the right to decide whether to meet their material demands. Do not let them take things for granted.</li>
<li><strong>Example is Better than Precept</strong>: Parents&rsquo; own spending habits are the best role model. If parents are thrifty and do not pursue material comparison (e.g., a car is fine as long as it drives; no need to chase the latest model), children will naturally be influenced.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q2</strong>: For Taiwan investors, QQQI tax refunds are delayed. Are there other local similar high-dividend funds as alternatives?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: I haven&rsquo;t specifically researched local funds in Taiwan. If you want to compare, you need to look at a few key indicators: 1. <strong>Max Drawdown</strong>, especially performance during the 2022 bear market; 2. <strong>Total Return</strong>, which is the sum of capital gains plus dividends. Compare these with QQQI to see which suits your needs better.</li>

<li><strong>Share 1</strong>: His middle school child spends all pocket money on game points, refuses to save, and even half-jokingly called his father &ldquo;shabby&rdquo; (stingy).
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Do Not Reward Grades with Money</strong>: Studying is the child&rsquo;s own responsibility. Using money as an incentive may distort their values.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Improper Speech Immediately</strong>: When a child says disrespectful words like &ldquo;shabby,&rdquo; you must correct them immediately and seriously. Make them understand that this is the parents&rsquo; money, and they have no right to judge it like that. Some jokes are not to be made. You must set clear boundaries and rules for the child.</li>

<li><strong>Q1</strong>: As a Taiwanese working in the mainland, how to safely transfer funds back to Taiwan after exceeding the annual foreign exchange quota of $50,000 USD for RMB income?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: This is a difficult problem; I don&rsquo;t have a perfect solution. Apart from carrying cash personally, official channels are indeed limited. Operating through company accounts is also very complex and requires trusted relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q2</strong>: For RMB that cannot be brought back to Taiwan for the time being, should I buy short-term products like government bonds or invest directly in Chinese index funds (like 513100)?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: Directly investing in index funds is also a good choice. Since the funds cannot be moved out for now, it is better to let them continue to appreciate in the local market. There is always a possibility that China&rsquo;s foreign exchange controls will loosen in the future.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Q3</strong>: Should I put all assets (including the cash portion) into the pledge account to keep them &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: I do not recommend doing this. You should keep a portion of assets in a regular account to maintain flexibility. In case of brokerage policy changes (e.g., increased interest rates, account freezes), you have other assets as bargaining chips or emergency funds, so you won&rsquo;t be completely passive.</li>

<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: Mainly three points: 1. <strong>Overcoming Human Weakness</strong>: Operating it yourself makes you susceptible to market emotions, chasing highs and selling lows. Fund managers can execute strategies more rationally. 2. <strong>Providing Downside Protection</strong>: For example, in 2022, QQQ fell nearly 40%, while QQQI only fell about 30%. 3. <strong>Unique Income Source</strong>: QQQI earns extra premiums (about 4-5%) by selling covered call options, which is a stable cash flow source difficult for ordinary investors to replicate, ensuring dividends can be paid even in a bear market.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: In the second year, the total debt is 1.2 million. You need to ensure the total market value of the assets pledged inside is maintained at 6 million (5 times 1.2 million). You can check how much the 3 million pledged in the first year has appreciated (e.g., to 4 million), and then just make up the difference (pledge another 2 million). There is no need to repay the principal after the loan expires; just pay the interest and handle the &ldquo;renewal,&rdquo; provided the maintenance rate is higher than the bank&rsquo;s minimum requirement (recommended above 167%).</li>

      <description>In this session, Teacher James introduces and demonstrates a portfolio backtesting App developed by community member Martin. By simulating stock pledging strategies under different market conditions in Taiwan and the US, the session explores the impact of different withdrawal rates (1.5% vs. 2.7%) on asset growth. The course emphasizes that while pledging can amplify long-term assets, it comes with higher risks and requires strict spending control. During the Q&amp;amp;A, students shared their journeys from anxiety to peace of mind, once again proving the power of long-term investing.</description>

<p>The core of this session is the introduction of a new portfolio backtesting simulation App, used to deeply analyze and compare the differences between <strong>stock pledging</strong> and <strong>non-pledging</strong> retirement withdrawal strategies. Through live demonstrations, Teacher James shows the maximum safe withdrawal rates (approx. 1.5%-1.8%) and risks of pledging strategies under different markets (Taiwan vs. US), interest rates, and LTV (Loan-to-Value) ratios. The core takeaway is: while pledging can significantly increase total terminal assets over the long term, it demands extremely high cash flow stability and very conservative withdrawal rates. Conversely, non-pledging strategies allow for a higher withdrawal rate (approx. 2.7%) but sacrifice asset growth for greater flexibility.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore Market Noise</strong>: Teacher James began by emphasizing that daily market fluctuations, international tensions, central bank rate changes, economic data, and financial reports are irrelevant to our long-term investment strategy. Investors should focus on holding for the long term and moving forward.</li>
<li><strong>The Logic Behind Choosing QQQ</strong>: We invest in indices like QQQ not by &ldquo;looking in the rearview mirror&rdquo; at past performance, but based on a belief in the future—<strong>belief in human growth, technological progress, and the development of the United States.</strong> QQQ is the purest representation of these three beliefs.</li>
<li><strong>Scam Warning</strong>: Students are reminded again to beware of fake accounts (often with suffixes like &lsquo;N&rsquo; or &lsquo;M&rsquo; added to the ID). Teacher James has only one account on Clubhouse; please verify carefully.</li>

<p>Developed by community member Martin, this App simulates long-term returns and risks under various asset allocations, pledging conditions, and withdrawal strategies.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Taiwan Scenario (40% QQQ, 30% QLD, 30% Cash)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parameters</strong>: Initial principal of 1 million, 3% interest rate, 60% LTV.</li>
<li><strong>Withdrawal Testing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Annual withdrawal of 1.5% (15,000): Results show assets survive safely from 2000 to 2025.</li>
<li>Annual withdrawal of 1.6% (16,000): Results show the portfolio is liquidated (fails) in 2009.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Under Taiwan&rsquo;s pledging conditions, the upper limit for a safe withdrawal rate is very strict at <strong>1.5%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>US Scenario (40% QQQ, 30% QLD, 30% Cash)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parameters</strong>: 6.5% interest rate, higher LTV (70% for QQQ, 95% for Cash, but QLD cannot be pledged).</li>
<li><strong>Withdrawal Testing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Annual withdrawal of 1.8%: Safely survives.</li>
<li>Annual withdrawal of 1.9%: Results in failure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Due to more relaxed LTV conditions in the US, the safe withdrawal rate can reach <strong>1.8%</strong>, showing slightly higher risk tolerance than in Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Interest Rates</strong>: When Teacher James lowered the US interest rate to 5% (the setting used in early Excel simulations), the safe withdrawal rate rose to <strong>2.1%</strong>, proving that interest rates are a critical variable in pledging safety.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-Pledging Strategy (80% QQQ, 20% Cash)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximum Withdrawal Rate</strong>: <strong>2.7%</strong> of assets annually.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome</strong>: While it safely survives 25 years, by 2025, the total asset value has barely grown, returning to its 2000 initial level. This strategy sacrifices capital appreciation for higher immediate cash flow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Comparison at Equal Withdrawal Rates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assume both strategies withdraw only 1.5% (15,000) annually.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Pledger</strong>: Assets grow to 1.61 million by 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Pledger (Taiwan Plan)</strong>: Assets grow to 4.75 million by 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Given the same low expenses, the pledging strategy can result in several times more asset growth. Investors must weigh &ldquo;higher asset growth&rdquo; against &ldquo;higher current cash flow.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pledging Risks are High</strong>: A 1.5% withdrawal rate means your total assets must be 66 times your annual expenses, a high bar for most people.</li>
<li><strong>Combine with High-Dividend ETFs</strong>: Retirees might consider allocating a small portion (e.g., 10%-20%) to high-dividend products (like QYI) to generate stable cash flow, reducing the amount and pressure of pledged loans.</li>
<li><strong>For Those Still Working</strong>: You can experiment with pledging while continuing monthly contributions, which makes the outlook much more optimistic.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Based on his own Excel models, he believed a 2% or even 2.2% withdrawal rate should be safe. He questioned the strict 1.5% result from the App and offered to help verify the source code.</li>
<li>Shared a Taiwan-version &ldquo;Buy vs. Rent&rdquo; spreadsheet, proving with data that over the long term, those who rent and invest will end up with assets vastly exceeding those who buy, with the gap reaching the &ldquo;hundreds of millions&rdquo; level.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Comment</strong>: James adjusted the simulation interest rate from 6.5% down to 5% on the spot, showing that a 2.1% withdrawal rate then became viable.

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He pointed out that from 1999 to 2006, there was no real trading data for QLD. Different simulated extrapolation methods used by various platforms lead to differences in backtesting results. This may explain the discrepancies between models.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Comment</strong>: James agreed and explained that the QLD backtesting data used in the App originated from his early Excel files, which indeed affects precision. However, he emphasized that the primary purpose of this tool is to help everyone grasp the &ldquo;vague correctness&rdquo; of different strategies rather than pursuing absolute numerical precision.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: When doing a Roth Conversion after retirement, if one does not use stock pledging, how should taxes be paid?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: There are two ways. One is paying with cash from your Brokerage Account, which is the best way as it maximizes the funds moved into the Roth. The second is having the broker withhold taxes during the conversion (e.g., convert 200k, withhold 20k for tax), but this reduces the principal entering the Roth.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Q1</strong>: In worst-case simulations (like the year 2000), cash positions and debt get very close. Is this safe enough?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: Yes, the simulation result is a &ldquo;narrow escape.&rdquo; In an extreme market crash of 85%, the assets just barely avoid liquidation. This illustrates why the withdrawal rate cannot be higher—2% is the tipping point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q2</strong>: When markets crash and cash is tight, should one be more cautious with &ldquo;Smart Rebalancing,&rdquo; such as reducing or pausing cash injections?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: Excellent question. We are indeed exploring more conservative approaches. One principle: if your cash reserve is lower than 15 (or even 20) years of living expenses, you should not touch it for rebalancing. An alternative is to sell some QQQ to buy QLD for rebalancing instead of using cash, preserving your safety net.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q3</strong>: When should company-issued semiconductor stocks be sold? Given tax issues, is it worth waiting or using complex Exchange Funds?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: As long as you have held them for over a year, a fixed long-term capital gains tax applies, which is independent of your personal income. Don&rsquo;t wait; sell after one year to diversify risk early. Avoid complex financial products like Exchange Funds—simple is best.</li>

<p><em>Context: Responding to Min&rsquo;s story, James explained the importance of financial literacy for individuals and families, comparing manual labor alone to the outdated tactics of the Boxers Rebellion.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Although it may take some time—maybe five, seven, or even ten years—knowing that there is an end goal allows a person&rsquo;s entire life to relax. They find true peace of mind.&rdquo;
&ndash; <strong>Teacher James</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><em>Context: Responding to Andy, James noted that the channel&rsquo;s greatest value isn&rsquo;t instant wealth, but providing a clear future to eliminate current anxiety.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A profession will not make you wealthy; only investing will. Your job can be taken away by others, but your investments are yours.&rdquo;
&ndash; <strong>Teacher James</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><em>Context: Responding to Clark, James highlighted the fundamental difference between earned income and invested assets; the former is &ldquo;passive&rdquo; (at the mercy of others), while the latter is one&rsquo;s true engine for wealth.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For a person earning minimum wage to end up with 1 billion&hellip; wealth is a natural, beautiful gift, but we haven&rsquo;t been educated on it.&rdquo;
&ndash; <strong>Teacher James</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><em>Context: After hearing Wu Li Yun&rsquo;s story of growing 1M to 5M on a basic salary, James remarked on the power of capitalism and how proper education enables regular people to reach once-unimaginable levels of wealth.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you want a class reversal, a class migration, you must awaken&hellip; Once you become the &lsquo;big tree&rsquo; of the family, you can flip the fate of the entire lineage.&rdquo;
&ndash; <strong>Teacher James</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><em>Context: Encouraging Min, James emphasized that young people should prioritize investing in themselves as the only way to achieve a leap in family wealth.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Finance is finance; you must stand on the side of rationality, never on the side of emotion.&rdquo;
&ndash; <strong>Min</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><em>Context: Min sharing how he convinced his girlfriend to invest rather than spending money on an emotionally satisfying but economically unproductive countryside house.</em></p>

<p>This session, through a practical backtesting App, turned the abstract concept of stock pledging into something concrete. Teacher James not only demonstrated the tool but, more importantly, revealed the trade-offs between risk and reward in different strategies. Pledging can significantly amplify wealth but requires extreme discipline; non-pledging is more flexible and suits those with higher cash flow needs. Most movingly, the real stories of students—especially Wu Li Yun from a grassroots background and Min&rsquo;s hardworking girlfriend—vividly illustrated the core philosophy: &ldquo;Investing can change your destiny.&rdquo; This was not just a technical analysis class, but a deep exchange about hope, peace, and life awakening, reaffirming the community&rsquo;s belief in long-term holding and simple investing.</p>

      <description>In this episode, Teacher James first emphasizes the risk of community scams and reiterates his core investment philosophy: ignore all market noise and persist in buying and holding index funds. He analyzes in detail the drawbacks of treating real estate as a primary investment, viewing it as a &amp;#39;prison,&amp;#39; and proposes strategies for achieving financial freedom through asset activation (such as selling property to invest in QQQYI to cover rent). The content also covers how to use credit and stock pledging correctly and safely, provides in-depth answers on asset allocation and tax issues for students in different investment stages and regions (Taiwan, China, US, Canada, Australia), and explores views on financial intelligence and life education for the next generation.</description>

<p>The core theme of this episode revolves around adhering to the &ldquo;buy and do not sell&rdquo; index investment discipline and applying it to financial decisions in real life. Teacher James emphasizes that investors should completely ignore all external noise such as market fluctuations, macroeconomics, and corporate earnings reports. He focuses on arguing that young people should prioritize increasing liquid assets rather than purchasing real estate, and shares how to solve housing and living cash flow problems by activating assets (such as selling a house to invest), thereby avoiding the trap of being &ldquo;house rich, cash poor&rdquo; (poor until only a room is left). In addition, the course delves into principles for the safe use of leverage and loans, and how to conduct robust asset allocation based on individual circumstances.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Beware of Scams</strong>: Teacher James first reminded everyone that scam accounts imitating his identity have appeared in the community (e.g., ID <code>clecchermannn</code>). His real ID is <code>cleccherman</code>, and he will never actively contact students privately to recommend investments. Students should contact him through the official Email channel.</li>
<li><strong>The Investor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ignorance&rdquo; Principle</strong>: For index investors, market volatility, international situations, central bank policies, market analysis, corporate earnings, and economic data are irrelevant. The core strategy is to buy the index, hold for the long term, and ignore market ups and downs.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Disclaimer</strong>: All content is for education and experience sharing, not investment advice. Investment risks are extremely high; everyone must self-assess whether they can withstand extreme scenarios where assets may continue to fall for 10 years with a depth of up to 85%.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Governments and Banks Sell Fear</strong>: They often use concepts like &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t buy now, you won&rsquo;t be able to afford it&rdquo; or &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t have a place to live when you&rsquo;re old&rdquo; to create anxiety, urging people to take on mortgages prematurely.</li>
<li><strong>Increase Liquid Assets First, Then Buy a House with Ease</strong>: One should first increase liquid assets through investment. When assets are substantial, buying a house is as simple as buying slippers, and one can even use stock pledging to borrow money for the purchase (&ldquo;empty-handed white wolf&rdquo; strategy) instead of draining one&rsquo;s own cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>A House is a &ldquo;Prison,&rdquo; Not an Asset</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Mindset Trap</strong>: Ordinary people buying a home for self-use is different from a developer&rsquo;s high-turnover business model. Living in it for decades locks up the asset completely, eventually leading to being &ldquo;poor until only a room is left.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty in Liquidation</strong>: Even if the house price rises, it cannot be easily liquidated for living expenses. Transaction costs are high (taxes, agency fees), and the turnover rate is extremely slow.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance Costs</strong>: Old houses face various maintenance issues like leaks, termites, and burst pipes, consuming mental energy.</li>

<li><strong>Case Study: Sell House to Rent, Activate Million-Dollar Assets</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Taking the US as an example, a retiree with a $1 million property should not live a frugal life guarding the house.</li>
<li><strong>Solution</strong>: Sell the $1 million house.
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1 (Solve Housing)</strong>: Take $300,000 and invest in high-dividend products (like QQQYI, 12% annualized yield), generating $36,000 in cash flow annually, sufficient to pay a monthly rent of $3,000. The remaining $700,000 can be used for investment and living.</li>
<li><strong>Option 2 (Solve Housing + Living)</strong>: Take $600,000 to invest in QQQYI, generating $72,000 annually. This not only covers rent but provides an extra $3,000 monthly for living expenses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Core Point</strong>: Why use assets worth $1 million or even $3 million to lock down a problem that can be solved with $300,000? This is the meaning of asset activation.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Correct Use of Credit</strong>: Any loan (credit, mortgage) must be based on &ldquo;stable salary income.&rdquo; After deducting all living expenses, there must still be spare capacity to repay principal and interest. Borrowing limits must never be determined based on how much cash reserve you have.</li>
<li><strong>Be Wary of Loan Models in Different Regions</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Taiwan</strong>: Most credit loans require repayment of principal and interest together, clearing the debt at maturity. This is relatively sound.</li>
<li><strong>Mainland China</strong>: Some credit products are &ldquo;interest-only first, principal repayment at maturity.&rdquo; This is extremely risky during market downturns. If the market is at a low point when the loan matures and is not renewed, investors may be forced to sell assets at a low point to repay, causing huge losses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledge the Unknown, Remain Humble</strong>: In front of the market, admit that you &ldquo;know nothing.&rdquo; Avoid overconfidence and attempts to predict the market; this is the foundation for long-term survival in the market.</li>

<li><strong>Temporarily Closing New Memberships</strong>: To let the community return to its original intention of helping newcomers and to improve discussion quality, it was decided to temporarily close new member joins and reorganize internally.</li>
<li><strong>Improving Discussion Methods</strong>: Future newcomers will be guided to use the &ldquo;Threads&rdquo; function for questions, facilitating concentrated and in-depth answers from seniors and preventing chat flooding.</li>

At that time, consider gradually introducing newcomers for teaching.</li>

<li>Question: A new student of two weeks in Taiwan, currently investing in high-dividend and market-cap ETFs (ratio 3:2). Has a mortgage but enough funds to pay it off. To retire within 10 years, considering a &ldquo;financial mortgage&rdquo; (interest-only, 7-10 year term) to cash out more funds for investment. Worried that the 10-year loan term is shorter than the 15-year &ldquo;guaranteed profit&rdquo; cycle mentioned by the teacher. If the market drops 85% at maturity and the bank pulls funding leading to bankruptcy, how to resolve this?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Do not recommend financial mortgages</strong>: This type of short-term loan with non-renewal risk is very dangerous. Once unemployed or if the market falls for a long time, you face bankruptcy risk.</li>
<li><strong>Suggest Traditional Mortgage</strong>: Suggest converting the mortgage to a 30-year principal and interest repayment loan. Extend the term as much as possible to lower monthly payments, thereby releasing more cash flow for investment.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Allocation Suggestion</strong>: For funds of 6 million TWD, start with a robust allocation, such as 70% 00662 (tracking Nasdaq 100) and 30% 00865B (Short-term Treasury/Cash). Do not rush into leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Gradually Adapt to Leverage</strong>: Since she previously invested in high-dividend products, her volatility tolerance is unknown. Suggests starting with a 10% position if trying leveraged funds (like 00670L) to personally experience the feeling of a 30%-60% market drop, then adjust gradually.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Sufficient Cash</strong>: Must reserve 2-3 years of living expenses as cash. Overall, a 6:1:3 (60% Market Cap, 10% Leverage, 30% Cash) allocation is a suitable starting point for now.</li>

<li>Question 1: Father has dizziness issues, similar to what the teacher once shared about his own father (carotid artery issue). Asking for the contact of the doctor who performed the stent procedure for the teacher&rsquo;s father.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is experience sharing, not medical advice. He pointed out that such issues should consult &ldquo;Cardiovascular Surgery&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cardiology,&rdquo; not the intuitive &ldquo;Neurology.&rdquo; He found Dr. <strong>Shih Chun-che</strong> (Cardiovascular Surgery) at Taipei Medical University, and the surgery was performed by his brother, Superintendent <strong>Shih Chun-min</strong>, at Wan Fang Hospital. Suggests consulting relevant departments at large teaching hospitals (e.g., NTU, Veterans General, Chang Gung).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: How to educate the next generation (4 years old)? He told his child he doesn&rsquo;t like his job as an engineer and encourages the child to learn arts (piano, dance) or become a dentist, hoping the child won&rsquo;t become a &ldquo;laborer&rdquo; like him and fall into class reproduction.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Correcting &ldquo;Laborer Thinking&rdquo;</strong>: The teacher pointed out sharply that the father&rsquo;s educational method is essentially still &ldquo;laborer thinking&rdquo; because he links interests directly to &ldquo;finding a job that won&rsquo;t be replaced&rdquo; and income.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Should Not equate to Income</strong>: The core of education is guiding children to explore and find what they truly love and want to do as soon as they wake up, not for making a living. Things you like don&rsquo;t necessarily have to have a salary.</li>
<li><strong>Parents are the Backup</strong>: The parents&rsquo; responsibility is to be the safety net during the child&rsquo;s life adventure, providing basic food and shelter.</li>
<li><strong>Cultivate Independence</strong>: After adulthood, children must learn to be responsible for their extra desires (like new phones, travel) and earn money to satisfy them.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Guidance</strong>: Parents should take children to experience the world, not instill concepts of &ldquo;what job is good/bad,&rdquo; and definitely not pass on their own negative emotions about work.</li>

Used this to add a point on child education: The most important role for parents is &ldquo;accompaniment,&rdquo; ensuring the child keeps up with daily learning, especially basics. Once the foundation (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) is not laid well, failing to keep up with later courses leads to a loss of interest in learning, which is more serious than sending them to any cram school.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Taxes</strong>: She remains a US tax resident and only needs to file US taxes as usual. Since there is no income in Taiwan, Taiwan tax is not involved.</li>
<li><strong>Residency</strong>: Can use visa-free entry for several months, then apply for an extension or do a &ldquo;visa run&rdquo; (travel to a nearby country and return).</li>
<li><strong>Travel Advice</strong>: Weather is best from November to January.

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Non-US tax residents buying through US brokers will have 30% tax withheld on dividends, discounting actual returns. Although theoretically one can apply for a tax refund, the process is extremely tedious. He suggests checking if the Hong Kong broker offers services to apply for refunds on your behalf. Meanwhile, he recommended a Mainland China OTC high-dividend fund, <strong>Southern Dividend Low Volatility 50 ETF (Code 008163)</strong>, with an annualized yield of about 10%, as a local alternative.</li>

<li>Question: Why recommend investing in QQQ (Nasdaq 100) instead of S&amp;P 500? Isn&rsquo;t QQQ more volatile?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Because QQQ has a higher long-term return rate. A portfolio of 500 companies is too diversified, affecting overall performance; 100 companies are diversified enough. For &ldquo;buy and hold&rdquo; investors, volatility during the process is not risk and can be completely ignored. Whenever there is money, one should buy.</li>

<li>Question 1: Misunderstood stock pledging. She thought her 4:3:3 combination (400k QQQ, 300k QLD, 300k Cash) allowed her to borrow $540k based on the broker&rsquo;s limit, asking how to use this money.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is an extremely dangerous misunderstanding. Borrowing such a high ratio means immediate bankruptcy if the market drops 80%. <strong>The principle of safe pledging is: borrow at most 2% of total assets annually.</strong> For $1 million in assets, the safe borrowing limit is only $20,000 per year for consumption or reinvestment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: For a retired person, if the 30% cash is only enough for 10 years of living expenses, and part of it is spent when the market falls, is there extra money to &ldquo;buy the dip&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>Non-retirees should not live off investment principal.</li>
<li>For retirees, ideal cash reserves should cover <strong>15 years</strong> of expenses (corresponding to total assets being 50 times annual expenses). If cash only covers 10 years, it means total assets are insufficient to support a leveraged configuration like 4:3:3, and high-dividend ETFs should be added to supplement cash flow.</li>
<li>The 15 years of living expenses used for safety <strong>must never</strong> be used to buy the dip, as this is for survival. Only &ldquo;extra&rdquo; cash beyond 15 years of expenses can be considered for investment during market drops.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is the reality of the financial services industry. The first step in financial management is to stay away from financial advisors and insurance agents. Although they seem to make easy money, they also face pressure from client complaints when the market falls. If Haoqing wants to enter this industry, it is feasible, but he must obtain relevant licenses (like CFA) to operate legally.</li>

<li>Question 1: If one has a separate stable cash reserve, can the investment portfolio be allocated as 60% QQQ and 40% QLD?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You cannot view the investment portfolio in isolation like this. You must calculate the ratio with all assets (including that &ldquo;separate&rdquo; cash) together. For example, if total assets are 1.4 million (of which 400k is cash), then a 700k QQQ and 300k QLD allocation is actually <strong>50% QQQ : 21% QLD : 29% Cash</strong>. This 5:2:3 ratio is reasonable because the leveraged fund (21%) does not exceed cash (29%) or the prototype fund (50%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: In the long run, is QLD&rsquo;s return guaranteed to be better than QQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>Absolutely not.</strong> After a deep bear market, leveraged funds may take decades to recover, while QQQ recovers much faster. The purpose of holding leveraged funds is to harvest profits into QQQ or cash through &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; during bull markets; it is not an asset to be held mindlessly forever. If the position becomes too high, it must be adjusted <strong>immediately</strong>; you cannot wait even one day.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Primary Risk</strong>: Sternly warned not to use US brokers because inheritance issues for non-US residents are extremely complex, and family members may not be able to retrieve the assets in the future. Strongly recommended moving to a <strong>Hong Kong broker</strong>.</li>

<p>This episode began with a warning about community scams, reinforcing the cornerstones of CLEC investment philosophy—discipline and mindset. Through a profound analysis of the concept of &ldquo;real estate,&rdquo; which is deeply rooted in Chinese society, Teacher James guided everyone to step out of traditional thinking frameworks, truly understand the value of &ldquo;liquid assets,&rdquo; and provided concrete and feasible asset activation plans. The Q&amp;A session covered multiple levels from asset allocation, leverage use, tax planning to children&rsquo;s education. The teacher&rsquo;s replies not only offered operational advice but also conveyed the underlying philosophy of life and risk management thoughts. The entire sharing session warns us that true financial freedom stems from correct cognition, strict discipline, and reverence for risk, rather than chasing or predicting the market.</p>

      <description>In this session, Teacher James shares his optimistic forecast for the December market, emphasizing that investors should get in as soon as possible. The core idea is &amp;#39;survival first, profit later,&amp;#39; meaning long-term returns are contingent on being able to withstand market volatility without being liquidated. This session highlights QQQI as a retirement cash flow tool and delves into the concept of real estate as a consumer good rather than an investment. Additionally, James provides updates on Canadian tax regulations, market capital flow (end of QT), and reiterates the importance of fraud prevention and the compliance of US stock pledging.</description>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market Outlook &amp; Capital Flow</strong>: The market is poised for a breakout to new highs. A strong rally is expected in December. An important backdrop is that QT (Quantitative Tightening) ended on December 1st. The central bank will now inject about $15 billion into the market weekly, totaling around $50 billion per month. This will create a massive capital flow, driving the market upward.</li>
<li><strong>The First Principle of Investing: Survive</strong>:
<ul>
<li>An annualized return of 15% is predicated on being able to stay invested for over 30 years without being liquidated due to fear or excessive leverage. If you exit midway, even the highest returns are irrelevant to you.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s better to choose a stable asset allocation that can survive any risk, even if the annualized return is only 7%. The key is to survive for 30 years or even longer.</li>
<li>The core of investing is <strong>doing the right thing</strong>. Regardless of the market&rsquo;s current state, you should always be buying. Be happy when it goes up, and don&rsquo;t panic when it goes down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Coping with Market Sentiment</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The principle of &ldquo;be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy&rdquo; is hard to execute. The simplest way to practice it is to <strong>resolutely not sell</strong>.</li>
<li>Investors need to admit that they &ldquo;know nothing&rdquo; and cannot predict market highs or lows. This allows them to respect the market and hold for the long term.</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s channel teaches only one thing: buy bravely and consistently, never sell, and you will succeed.</li>

<li><strong>Background</strong>: To provide a new option for retirees who need a stable cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Ticker Introduction</strong>: QQQI (Nasdaq-100 Enhanced Opt &amp; Growth ETF).</li>
<li><strong>Features &amp; Advantages</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>High Dividend</strong>: The dividend yield can reach 12%. For example, an investment of $1 million can generate $120,000 in cash flow per year ($10,000 per month); an investment of $5 million can yield $600,000 per year ($50,000 per month).</li>
<li><strong>Lowers the Retirement Threshold</strong>: For retirees who haven&rsquo;t prepared 25-30 times their annual expenses, investing just 8-10 times their annual expenses in QQQI can generate enough cash flow to cover living costs.</li>
<li><strong>Operational &amp; Tax Advantages</strong>: QQQI distributes dividends derived from a portion of capital gains (from selling appreciated stocks) and income from selling covered call options (about 4-5% annually). For Taiwanese investors using a brokerage with QI (Qualified Intermediary) status (like E.Sun, Yuanta, Cathay, SinoPac, etc.), most of the dividend income, being sourced from capital gains, is eligible for a tax refund. Approximately 96% of the dividends can be refunded.</li>

<li><strong>Act Decisively</strong>: Investors who are still hesitating and haven&rsquo;t entered the market should stop &ldquo;daydreaming.&rdquo; Be &ldquo;ruthless&rdquo; in your actions—immediately sell what you shouldn&rsquo;t hold, buy the correct asset allocation, and then &ldquo;get on the bus and go to sleep.&rdquo; Financial freedom won&rsquo;t be far off.</li>
<li><strong>A House is a Consumer Good, Not an Investment</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve reached a level of wealth where &ldquo;buying a house is like buying a pair of slippers,&rdquo; then buying a luxury home to enjoy life is perfectly fine.</li>
<li>But beware of becoming &ldquo;high-income but exquisitely poor,&rdquo; where your cash flow is extremely tight just to maintain a lavish home. This is akin to buying yourself a giant &ldquo;cage.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>The Correct Sequence</strong>: You should invest first and let your money make money. For example, <strong>if you have $1 million now, first invest it to grow into $200 million, and only then take out $100 million to buy a house.</strong> This way, you can truly enjoy the pleasure of living without being shackled by your property.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Subconscious and Manifestation</strong>: It is recommended to watch a video in the presentation notes that teaches how to connect your subconscious with universal energy. The core principle is to &ldquo;believe&rdquo; first, then meditate in a state of peace, happiness, and love, which makes it easier to manifest your desires.</li>

<li><strong>Regarding QQQI Tax Refund</strong>: Taiwanese investors need to confirm if their brokerage has &ldquo;QI status.&rdquo; If so, they can get a tax refund on their QQQI investment. The method may vary; some brokerages don&rsquo;t withhold tax upfront, while others withhold and then refund it. Most medium to large brokerages have QI status.</li>
<li><strong>The Ease and Persistence of Investing</strong>: Any diligent investment method can make money, but Teacher James&rsquo;s method is the most effortless and worry-free.

<li>Question: With the development of AI, will countries like Vietnam and Indonesia lose the opportunity to transition from labor-intensive to tech-based economies, as Taiwan and South Korea did, and thus be permanently locked at the bottom of the value chain?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This issue is more severe than imagined. The impact of AI is global, not just limited to developing countries. Taiwan&rsquo;s semiconductor industry could also be replaced by fully automated AI factories. The future society will be divided into a tiny minority of capitalists (about 0.1%) and a vast majority of ordinary people (99.9%) dependent on social welfare. The only way out is to become a capitalist—get on board (invest) as soon as possible to enjoy the dividends of this technological revolution. Otherwise, everyone could be left behind by the times.</li>

You can use the NT$6 million loan to invest for yourself, and the returns can be used to support your mother in the future.

<li>Question 1: I have initial capital and a monthly salary. Should I DCA monthly, or accumulate for a year and then rebalance according to the 433 strategy?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Buy whenever you have money each month. Don&rsquo;t wait a year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Using the 433 allocation, what should I do with the money borrowed from a stock pledge if I don&rsquo;t need it immediately?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>(Extremely Important Warning!)</strong> If you are in the United States, money borrowed from a pledge <strong>absolutely cannot</strong> be put back into a securities account. The fund flow must be clearly for consumption. A friend has already been asked by Schwab to close their pledge account for this reason, or face a forced sale of stocks to repay the loan. The consequences are severe. If you are not in the US, this amount (at most 2% of assets borrowed annually) is small, so reinvesting it won&rsquo;t have a major impact.</li>

<li><strong>Stocks vs. Real Estate</strong>: After some thought, she concluded that stocks grow through compounding, while real estate&rsquo;s advantage is leverage. However, due to the growth rate difference between stocks (~10%) and real estate (~6%), plus loan interest, the leverage advantage of real estate is depleted after about 7-8 years. After that, the growth curve of stocks will far surpass that of real estate.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>The 159509 she bought before is a technology fund, not a Nasdaq-100 index. It&rsquo;s recommended to choose the tickers we suggest.</li>
<li>Since you can tolerate high volatility, you can use a very aggressive allocation: <strong>85% QQQ + 10% QLD + 5% TQQQ</strong>, and rebalance once a year.</li>
<li><strong>Transfer immediately!</strong> Your brokerage&rsquo;s fees are extremely high and it&rsquo;s not safe. Schwab is the best choice—it&rsquo;s secure and commission-free.</li>

<li>Sharing: From mainland China, he just discovered the channel last week and felt a sense of &ldquo;sudden enlightenment,&rdquo; with hope for his future. He and his wife had followed the traditional path of buying a house and taking on a mortgage, leading to immense pressure. After listening to the teacher&rsquo;s classes, his mindset completely changed. He no longer frets over grievances at work because he knows he will be wealthy in the future.</li>
<li>Question 1: I have a mortgage (covered by the Housing Provident Fund) and a personal loan. How should I handle them?</li>
<li>Question 2: I have 100,000 RMB available for investment (after setting aside six months of living expenses). Should I allocate it as 80% index / 20% cash?</li>
<li>Question 3: I&rsquo;ve opened a Schwab account and plan to open an account in Hong Kong in the future for pledging. Is this plan feasible?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>Continue to use the Provident Fund for the mortgage. For the personal loan, don&rsquo;t rush to pay off the principal; just pay the interest and use it as a revolving line of credit.</li>
<li>Yes, apply an 80/20 allocation to all your investable assets. The 20% cash can be put into a money market fund.</li>
<li>The plan is excellent. Start transferring some funds to Hong Kong annually now. Once the capital reaches a certain size, you can start pledging. This is a correct ten-year plan. Also, don&rsquo;t be afraid to have a second child because of financial pressure. You will be very wealthy in the future, and having more children will make your family happier.</li>

<p>This session began with a very optimistic market forecast (end of QT, influx of capital) and reinforced CLEC&rsquo;s core investment philosophy: <strong>simple, persistent, and brave</strong>. Teacher James not only gave clear instructions—&ldquo;keep buying, don&rsquo;t sell&rdquo;—but also built a solid theoretical foundation from both psychological and strategic standpoints. Whether it was emphasizing the importance of &ldquo;survival,&rdquo; introducing the powerful retirement cash flow tool QQQI, or subverting the traditional concept that &ldquo;a house is a cage,&rdquo; the goal was to help investors establish a correct view of wealth, break free from anxiety, and embark on a relaxed yet firm path to financial freedom. The enthusiastic sharing and questions from the students also provided vivid interpretations and applications of these concepts in real-life situations.</p>

      <description>In this session, Teacher James delves into the core of successful investing: &amp;#39;inaction,&amp;#39; emphasizing that investors should ignore market noise, buy, and hold for the long term. At the same time, he highlights the potential extreme risks of the market, namely a possible 85% drop lasting for ten years, and points out that only through proper asset allocation and holding sufficient cash can one withstand such risks. Additionally, the teacher shares profound reflections on the capitalist system and, combined with Munger&amp;#39;s wisdom, answers several student questions regarding leverage, consumer attitudes, wealth succession, and high-dividend investment strategies.</description>

<p>The core message of this lecture is that <strong>&ldquo;The Key to Successful Investing is Inaction.&rdquo;</strong> Teacher James emphasizes that investors should minimize decision-making and ignore all market noise, such as economic data, international situations, and interest rate hikes or cuts, as these are irrelevant to long-term investing. The correct approach is to do nothing after buying quality assets. However, the prerequisite for &ldquo;inaction&rdquo; is a deep understanding of market risks. One must prepare for the worst-case scenario (e.g., an 85% asset decline lasting for ten years). Only through rigorous asset allocation and maintaining sufficient cash flow can one ensure survival in this prolonged test.</p>

<li><strong>Scam Alert</strong>: The teacher once again called out a scam account (ID changed to <code>James.James.1</code>), reminding everyone that he would never engage in any form of proxy trading, charge fees, or ask for money transfers. Anyone doing so in his name is a scammer.</li>
<li><strong>Munger Wisdom Video Recommendation</strong>: The teacher highly recommended a video (1 hour and 23 minutes) about Charlie Munger&rsquo;s life wisdom. The video focuses more on interpersonal, family, and marital relationships and life philosophy rather than just investing, and the teacher found its content to be very accurate and profound.</li>
<li><strong>Encouraging Content Creation</strong>: The teacher shared the example of a student, &ldquo;Wen Yan,&rdquo; who used an AI tool (notebooklm) to turn a two-hour lecture video into a ten-minute short, which achieved excellent reach on Xiaohongshu and Bilibili. The teacher encouraged everyone to use the channel&rsquo;s public materials for secondary creation and dissemination to promote correct investment philosophies.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Fewer Decisions, the Better</strong>: In investing, the most successful strategy is to &ldquo;make no decisions.&rdquo; When the market panics and everyone is discussing various macroeconomic issues, the best response is to ignore them.</li>
<li><strong>The Core of Investing</strong>: The most important and difficult thing in investing is to &ldquo;stay put&rdquo; after buying, which requires immense discipline. Any attempt to operate, change, or predict the market is almost destined to lower final investment performance.</li>
<li><strong>Practicing &ldquo;Inaction&rdquo;</strong>: The core skill to practice in investing is &ldquo;inaction.&rdquo; Your feelings are worthless in the face of the market, even &ldquo;garbage.&rdquo; You must be emotionless to invest successfully.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Duality of the Market</strong>: In the long run, the market will inevitably hit new highs (there is no highest, only higher), which is a natural consequence of human societal development. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean the market won&rsquo;t fall.</li>
<li><strong>The Inevitability of Extreme Risk</strong>: In an investor&rsquo;s lifetime, they will inevitably encounter an extreme situation where the market drops 85% from its peak, and this downturn could last as long as ten years.</li>
<li><strong>Qualification for Investing</strong>: You are only truly qualified to invest when you can face an 85% drop in your assets without a rebound for ten years, still adhere to the principle of &ldquo;never sell,&rdquo; and live a normal life. If you cannot accept the decline, you should not invest.</li>
<li><strong>The Only Antidote to Risk</strong>: The only way to combat this extreme risk is <strong>asset allocation</strong>. You must assume the worst-case scenario will happen tomorrow and allocate your assets accordingly, ensuring you have enough cash (e.g., enough to live on for ten years) to get through the crisis.</li>

<li><strong>Designed Laborers</strong>: Teacher James pointed out that the entire capitalist society educates the public to be diligent laborers, not capitalists.

<li><strong>The Trap of Traditional Financial Advice</strong>: Following the traditional path of &ldquo;work hard, save in the bank, buy insurance&rdquo; will ultimately lead to poverty. Savings are eroded by inflation, and money earned through labor and time can never achieve true financial freedom.</li>
<li><strong>A Shift in Mindset</strong>: The purpose of this channel is not just to teach how to get rich, but to awaken a &ldquo;capitalist consciousness.&rdquo; Once you establish a capitalist mindset, even without great wealth at present, you are already on the path to riches and can achieve inner liberation and happiness.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He has recently been studying Charlie Munger&rsquo;s wisdom in depth and advises everyone to listen to the views of wise people rather than getting caught up in whether the market is at a high point. He believes that in a bull market, investors should examine their own capabilities and risk control to avoid excessive borrowing.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Charlie Munger repeatedly warns against using leverage and borrowing money to invest. This seems to differ from the channel&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;pledging assets for a loan to invest.&rdquo; How does the teacher view this difference?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: What Munger opposes is the kind of leverage that could cause you to <strong>lose your freedom or go bankrupt</strong>. For example, a property developer who bets everything and goes bankrupt due to soaring interest rates, or an ordinary person who takes out a loan for a luxury house beyond their means to save face, ending up trapped by the loan and losing the freedom to quit their job. Munger&rsquo;s core idea is &ldquo;don&rsquo;t lose your freedom because of debt.&rdquo; The borrowing we advocate is based on extremely strict risk control: you must be able to assume that the stock market could drop to zero and stay there for 15 years, and you would still be fine. Only then can you borrow that money. This requires investors to have adequate asset allocation and cash flow and is not suitable for those nearing retirement. Therefore, the core spirit of both views is consistent: emphasizing survival and freedom in the worst-case scenario.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He mentioned that a legislator in Taiwan is recently promoting an investment plan for infants aged 0-10, where the government and parents would each contribute 4,000 TWD/month into an ETF.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This direction is correct, but requiring parents to contribute places a huge burden on young families, which is a flaw. He suggested a better way would be for all listed companies to increase their capital by 1% annually, inject these shares into a &ldquo;Taiwan ETF pool,&rdquo; and then distribute them to newborns. This way, neither the government nor the parents have to pay; the capitalists invest in the country&rsquo;s future, which would face less resistance.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: He believes the current AI development is just the beginning of a great era, far from being a bubble. He is willing to endure short-term fluctuations of 20-30% in exchange for potentially 10x returns in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: He shared his transformation from an &ldquo;employee mindset&rdquo; to a &ldquo;capitalist mindset.&rdquo; In the past, society taught us to pursue high income, then buy a nice car and a nice house, but this is actually a trap that keeps you working for capitalists. He shared how he once sold a luxury car and invested the 2 million TWD into an index fund, a decision that became one of the best of his life.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: There&rsquo;s recent discussion in Taiwan about calculating the supplementary health insurance premium based on total annual dividend income. How does this affect investors in high-dividend ETFs like 0056? What are the teacher&rsquo;s suggestions?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: First, he criticized the unfairness of this tax system, as it specifically targets vulnerable groups who rely on dividends, while capital gains are not taxed. He believes all income should be taxed fairly. Second, he proposed a solution: where there&rsquo;s a policy, there&rsquo;s a countermeasure. If dividend taxes or premiums become too high, investors can consider investing in US-listed high-dividend ETFs, such as <strong>JEPQ</strong> or <strong>QQQI</strong>, through a &ldquo;sub-brokerage&rdquo; service. The income from these would be considered overseas income, which has a high tax exemption threshold in Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>Follow-up Discussion</strong>: A student pointed out that dividends from products like JEPQ purchased through a sub-brokerage might be subject to a 30% withholding tax, and some brokers (like Cathay) do not assist with tax refunds. Therefore, the teacher emphasized that before undertaking such an operation, one <strong>must</strong> confirm the tax policies with their broker. If the tax is withheld and cannot be refunded, it is not a suitable investment.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He started investing in 2021, experienced a 20-30% paper loss but held on, and has now not only recovered but also seen good returns. This has built his confidence in long-term investing.

He also successfully shared this philosophy with his family, who have started buying 00662.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Helping those around you is great, but you must also know when to &ldquo;let go.&rdquo; For those who cannot be persuaded, don&rsquo;t force it.

<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: He has seen families turn against each other over inheritance. He is puzzled why wealth can harm families and asked for the teacher&rsquo;s perspective on the phenomenon where the first generation strives, the second is harmonious, but by the third, disagreements and conflicts arise in wealth succession.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Property disputes usually happen when the heirs are in dire need of money. For them, any slight injustice is magnified. The most troublesome assets are illiquid ones like real estate. For elders who wish to distribute their assets according to their will, they must plan ahead while alive through <strong>trusts</strong> or <strong>gifts</strong>. Once a person passes away, everything can only be distributed according to the law. As children, the best approach is to follow legal procedures to avoid disputes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: He observed that even business owners work like laborers, constantly working and expanding. Others who are financially free dare not stop, feeling useless without work. Is this the result of capitalist indoctrination?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: As long as a person needs to go to work every day, even if it&rsquo;s their own company, they are still a &ldquo;laborer,&rdquo; and they even bear the risk of their own capital, which is a double risk. A true capitalist has no responsibilities and lets money work for them. This &ldquo;workaholic&rdquo; mindset is shaped by decades of education and work environment and is indeed hard to change. Munger also reminds us not to neglect family for the sake of making money, or you might win wealth but lose at life.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He shared the story of his 78-year-old American landlord. The landlord placed all 13 properties he built into a family trust, managed jointly by his descendants, to maintain family cohesion and wealth. He compared this model to the teacher&rsquo;s preferred QQQ model and marveled at how wise his decision was to sell his property and switch to QQQ, which has freed him from excitement or fear over market fluctuations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The landlord&rsquo;s approach was one of &ldquo;necessity.&rdquo; Holding a large amount of real estate presents problems like difficulty in division and high inheritance taxes. Setting up a trust for descendants to manage essentially turns them into &ldquo;laborers,&rdquo; bound by these properties for generations. If he had held QQQ, wealth succession would be much simpler, easily done through annual gifts, and his descendants wouldn&rsquo;t have to toil to manage the assets, allowing them to truly enjoy the freedom that wealth brings.</li>

<p>&ldquo;To succeed in investing, the fewer decisions you make, the better. Making no decision is the best decision.&rdquo;

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You must assume that the market will start falling tomorrow, that it will fall by 85%, and that it will last for 10 years. Only if you can still make your investments and asset allocations under this assumption&hellip; are you qualified to invest.&rdquo;

<p><strong>Context</strong>: When discussing risk control, the teacher proposed an extremely harsh psychological and financial test. Only investors who can pass this &ldquo;stress test&rdquo; are truly prepared.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Your feelings are garbage as far as the market is concerned. So in the market, don&rsquo;t talk about feelings. You should have no feelings to be able to invest.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The teacher sharply pointed out that investing is a rational domain, and any judgment based on personal feelings or emotions is worthless, or even has negative value, in the face of Mr. Market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In a capitalist society, everyone is educated to become a diligent laborer. The banks and the government essentially want to empty your pockets so you can work hard for the country.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The teacher offered a profound critique of the current socioeconomic system, arguing that it encourages people to become laborers who are then systematically &ldquo;harvested.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What Munger is talking about with borrowing is that you will lose your freedom&hellip; You must not lose your freedom because of borrowing, this is very important.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: In explaining Munger&rsquo;s opposition to leverage, the teacher grasped its core message—the biggest risk of leverage is not financial loss, but the potential loss of personal freedom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Saving is a very bad thing. So if you put your money in the bank, it gets thinner and thinner with inflation. How can you possibly become rich? It&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The teacher challenged conventional wisdom, pointing out that in an era of inflation, keeping money in a bank is tantamount to asset depreciation and is a major obstacle to wealth creation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As long as you need to get up and go to work every day, even if it&rsquo;s your own company, you are a laborer.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: When answering a student&rsquo;s question about whether a boss is a capitalist, the teacher gave a clear definition: a true capitalist makes money work for them, not the other way around.</p>

<p>This lecture, starting from the core investment philosophy of &ldquo;inaction,&rdquo; builds a complete system of investment thought. Teacher James not only emphasized the importance of long-term holding and ignoring noise but also spent a significant amount of time analyzing the most critical and often overlooked aspect of investing—risk awareness. He demanded that every investor confront the market&rsquo;s cruelest possibilities and build their investment portfolio based on that benchmark. In the Q&amp;A session, through in-depth interaction with students, the lecture&rsquo;s content was greatly enriched and deepened. Whether it was the interpretation of Munger&rsquo;s &ldquo;no borrowing&rdquo; wisdom, or discussions on wealth succession and tax planning, the session was full of practical guidance and thought-provoking philosophy. Ultimately, the lecture returned to a fundamental question: we invest and manage our finances to achieve true freedom, not to be enslaved by wealth.</p>

      <description>In this session, Teacher James details the &amp;#39;Flexible Smart Rebalancing&amp;#39; strategy developed by student Peng, an enhanced version of the traditional smart rebalancing aimed at improving asset allocation security. The core of the strategy is to set a cash-year threshold, flexibly adjusting the funding source for rebalancing. Additionally, James discusses withdrawal rates corresponding to different Beta values and introduces high-dividend ETFs like JEPQ as a solution for retirees with insufficient cash flow.</description>

<p>This session delves into the &ldquo;Flexible Smart Rebalancing&rdquo; optimization strategy. Its core idea is to add a &ldquo;cash years&rdquo; criterion to the traditional smart rebalancing framework. When cash reserves fall below a preset number of years (e.g., 15 years), market downturns will no longer deplete cash. Instead, the underlying fund (e.g., QQQ) will be used to buy more of the leveraged fund to protect cash flow and enhance the portfolio&rsquo;s security. Concurrently, for retirees with higher cash flow needs, an alternative solution of allocating to high-dividend ETFs (such as JEPQ) is proposed.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strategy Background</strong>: This strategy was optimized and back-tested by student Peng, based on Teacher James&rsquo;s smart rebalancing concept, with the goal of increasing the maintenance rate (security).</li>
<li><strong>Core Mechanism</strong>: It introduces a customizable &ldquo;cash years&rdquo; variable (e.g., 15 years) as a threshold for switching strategies.
<ol>
<li><strong>When Cash Level is Below 15 Years</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>During a Market Upturn</strong>: Profits from the leveraged fund are moved into cash, with the goal of replenishing cash reserves to over 15 years as quickly as possible. Consider transferring 30%, 40%, or 50% of the profitable portion to accelerate cash accumulation.</li>
<li><strong>During a Market Downturn</strong>: <strong>Do not use cash</strong>. Instead, sell the underlying fund (e.g., QQQ) to buy the leveraged fund (e.g., TQQQ) to maintain the Beta value while protecting precious cash reserves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>When Cash Level is Above 15 Years</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The strategy reverts to traditional smart rebalancing. During a market downturn, cash can be used to buy more of the leveraged fund.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Strategy Version Evolution (1.0 vs. 2.0)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Version 1.0</strong>: The core is to reduce downside risk. During upturns, profits from the leveraged fund are converted to cash.</li>
<li><strong>Version 2.0</strong>: With sufficient cash (above the threshold), it increases upside potential. During upturns, profits from the leveraged fund can be moved into the underlying fund (QQQ) instead of cash. This slows down the decrease in Beta, allowing for the capture of more upside opportunities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Back-testing Conclusion</strong>: Data shows that under different Beta settings, the &ldquo;Flexible Rebalancing&rdquo; strategy, especially when using the appropriate version for different Beta values, generally provides a higher minimum maintenance rate than traditional smart rebalancing, meaning higher security.</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationship Between Beta and Withdrawal Rate</strong>: The recommended annual withdrawal rate varies with the portfolio&rsquo;s volatility (Beta):
<ul>
<li>Beta 1.0: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.0%</li>
<li>Beta 0.9: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.2%</li>
<li>Beta 0.8: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.4%</li>
<li>Beta 0.7: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.8%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Solution for High Withdrawal Rates</strong>: When the required withdrawal rate <strong>exceeds 3%</strong>, traditional asset allocation becomes riskier. It is recommended to introduce high-dividend assets to supplement cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Introduction to High-Dividend ETFs (JEPQ &amp; JEPI)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>JEPQ</strong>: Annualized dividend yield of about 10%. Approximately 80% of its assets are in QQQ, with the other 20% generating cash flow by selling covered calls. Its Beta is about 0.78, making it less volatile than QQQ and suitable for retirees needing high cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>JEPI</strong>: Annualized dividend yield of about 8.37%. It operates based on SPY and has a lower Beta of about 0.57.</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: These ETFs are primarily suitable for investors who are <strong>already retired, have insufficient principal, and are highly dependent on stable cash flow</strong>. They are not recommended for young investors still in the asset accumulation phase, as their long-term capital appreciation potential is far lower than QQQ.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Principles</strong>: Even if you don&rsquo;t understand the complex strategy details, grasp these key principles:
<ol>
<li><strong>Cash is King</strong>: If using a stock pledge loan, maintain a cash position of at least 30%.</li>
<li><strong>15-Year Cash Goal</strong>: Strive to maintain cash reserves equivalent to at least 15 years of living expenses as an important safety buffer.</li>
<li><strong>Beta Control</strong>: Keep the overall portfolio Beta below 1.0 to navigate market fluctuations smoothly.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Assets and Inflation</strong>: Stocks are real assets, and their intrinsic value is not eroded by inflation. When currency depreciates, the price of assets (stock prices) will rise to reflect their value. Therefore, do not sell quality assets (like QQQ) due to fears of inflation or short-term market volatility. Selling at any time is a mistake.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing:
<ol>
<li><strong>Inspiration for Flexible Rebalancing 1.0</strong>: It originated from Teacher James&rsquo;s mention that when cash is less than 15 years, one should not use cash to buy leveraged funds during a down year. Based on this, he conducted quantitative back-testing and tested different cash-year thresholds (13, 14, 15, 16 years) and the effect of transferring different percentages (30%, 40%, 50%) of profits to cash during upturns.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration for Flexible Rebalancing 2.0</strong>: Inspired by a strategy shared by student Lin. He pondered whether, when the cash position is sufficient, profits from the leveraged fund could be moved to the underlying fund (instead of cash) to slow the decline in Beta, thereby capturing more future upside potential.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Version 1.0 aims to &ldquo;reduce downside risk,&rdquo; while Version 2.0 builds on this to &ldquo;increase upside potential.&rdquo; He emphasized that the current back-testing period is limited and this is still his personal exploration, not to be taken as a final conclusion. However, the general direction is that a higher cash position leads to a higher maintenance rate.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: Why do you recommend withdrawing 2% annually instead of borrowing the full 20% of the pledge limit from the start?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a critical risk control issue. If you borrow 20% at once and the market experiences a major crash like in 2000 (an 85% drop), your assets would fall from $1 million to $150,000, but your debt would still be $200,000. you would go bankrupt immediately. By withdrawing 2% annually, even if the market declines for three or four consecutive years, you would have only used 8% of your total assets, and your assets would still be far greater than your liabilities, allowing you to survive the crisis safely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing: He observed that QQQ&rsquo;s annual return (23.29%) has surpassed VT&rsquo;s (19.92%), refuting an influencer&rsquo;s previous claim that VT would crush QQQ.

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Two things are especially important in investing: first, clarifying your investment Purpose, and second, setting a matching Target. The most dangerous situation is a mismatch between purpose and target. For example, investing with a mindset of entertainment (gambling) but expecting a stable cash flow or high returns will inevitably lead to disaster. Many friends around her made this mistake by engaging in all sorts of frantic trading during a bull market.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Very well said. It&rsquo;s like someone who does drugs and stays up all night but expects to be healthy—an impossible task. The actions of most people are contrary to their ultimate goals, but they don&rsquo;t realize it themselves. This is a lifelong tragedy.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your situation is excellent. Since your basic living expenses are covered by this $100,000 stable cash flow, you don&rsquo;t need to reserve that many years of cash. Depending on your comfort level, you can keep, for instance, 5 years of cash or 10% of your total assets in cash as a backup. The rest of your funds can be confidently invested in QQQ and leveraged funds.</li>

<li>Question 1: Most of her funds are in a US retirement account (a Rollover IRA from a 401k) and she was told she cannot use them for a stock pledge loan. This might prevent her from retiring early. How should she handle this?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a common trap. He does not recommend over-contributing to retirement accounts (like the Mega Backdoor Roth). The remedy now is: immediately stop contributing more money to the retirement account and focus all your efforts on building a personal brokerage account. At the same time, you should start converting funds from your Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA annually as soon as possible. Within the IRA, you can also allocate: put a small amount in a Roth IRA to buy TQQQ, so the high-growth portion is tax-free; keep the majority in the Traditional IRA holding QQQ or cash, which will reduce the tax burden during conversion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Are JEPQ and JEPI meant to be replacements for QQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Not replacements. They are tools for a specific group of people (retired, insufficient principal, need high cash flow). Those still in the asset accumulation phase should not touch them. The funding allocation order for retirees should be: 1. Meet cash flow needs (JEPQ), 2. Set aside an emergency fund, 3. Only if there is money left over, consider investing in QQQ for growth.</li>

<li>Sharing: She bought QQQ in 2021 after listening to the teacher&rsquo;s class but sold in a panic during the 2022 market downturn. This year, she rebuilt her confidence, consolidated her assets, and followed the teacher&rsquo;s method. She is now up over 30% and feels more confident about her future retirement.</li>
<li>Question 1: In the event of future hyperinflation, which is a better store of value, real estate or stocks? Can the stock market withstand the test?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Stocks are assets. Inflation means money is worthless, but the value of the asset remains. At that time, the price of the asset (stock price) will rise to reflect its real value. Short-term market drops are due to human fear, not value destruction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Is the 10% dividend from JEPQ fixed? If the principal drops from $500,000 to $300,000, will the dividend also decrease proportionally?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Its dividend amount is relatively stable; it does not fluctuate strictly as a percentage of the principal. It&rsquo;s more like an annuity, designed to provide a steady stream of cash flow. So even if the market value drops, the dividend amount you receive will not decrease proportionally.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You can&rsquo;t save them; this is their &ldquo;fate.&rdquo; Not everyone can become wealthy; 99.99% of people are destined to be poor.

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: It was because of a specific case: a 72-year-old student with only $600,000 in principal who needs $40,000 a year for living expenses. To help solve his problem, I researched high-dividend products and found JEPQ and JEPI to be relatively stable options. This is because they are not purely derivatives; they hold a large amount of real assets (80% index components), so they can be considered. This is to solve the cash flow problem for seniors, not a recommendation for the average investor.</li>

<li>Sharing: He shared the story of a 78-year-old relative in his family who is in financial difficulty due to kidney failure, requiring dialysis three times a week. He advised the relative to sell a piece of ancestral land that generated no cash flow and invest the funds into Taiwan&rsquo;s high-dividend ETF 0056. This would generate nearly 600,000 TWD in annual cash flow (50,000 TWD per month), completely solving her living expenses and allowing her to live with more dignity. He believes that the form of an asset can be changed; converting land into a stock asset that continuously generates cash flow can also be passed down to future generations.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: There is much suffering in the world, but the number of people we can help is limited. You gave excellent advice, but if she is unwilling to sell the land, that is her choice. We can only help those who are willing to be helped. At the same time, he also reminded everyone to protect their kidney health, drink more water, and stay away from junk food and sugary drinks.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>You think what you&rsquo;re doing is moving you towards your goal, but in reality, you&rsquo;re just moving further away from it, and you still think you&rsquo;re heading towards your goal. This is the most frightening thing.
&ndash; Lin</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote profoundly points out the disconnect between the actions and goals of many investors. They engage in speculative, trend-chasing, and other entertainment-like operations, yet expect to achieve long-term, stable financial objectives. Ultimately, they often end up going in the opposite direction, wasting precious time and capital.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stocks are assets&hellip; How much they sell for is determined by you, the asset owner&hellip; As long as you sell (QQQ), you are wrong. Selling at any time is wrong because you are selling too low.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to concerns about inflation, Teacher James emphasized the nature of quality stocks as real assets. Their long-term value will continuously grow, and short-term price fluctuations should not affect the determination to hold. Selling quality assets is equivalent to giving away huge future potential at a low price.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can&rsquo;t save the poor&hellip; 99.99% of people are fated to be poor, it can&rsquo;t be helped. So you should just&hellip; let go.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>While this statement may sound blunt, it reflects a reality in investment education: we can only influence those who are willing to accept and change. For family or friends who are stubborn and dominated by fear, it is better to let go and focus on one&rsquo;s own growth than to persuade them in vain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When people get old, if you don&rsquo;t have money, others might see you as a kind of &rsquo;lower-class elderly&rsquo;.
&ndash; Haoqing</p></blockquote>
<p>This point raised by Haoqing in his sharing very realistically highlights the importance of financial independence in old age. Having a stable cash flow is not just for survival, but for maintaining dignity, avoiding dependency on others, and being at their mercy in one&rsquo;s later years.</p>

<p>This session provided a significant optimization to the smart rebalancing strategy from a more refined and secure perspective, introducing the concept of &ldquo;Flexible Rebalancing.&rdquo; The core idea is to protect cash as a lifeline, preferring to exchange underlying assets for leveraged assets rather than easily tapping into cash reserves when they are insufficient. At the same time, the course demonstrated strong practicality by offering concrete and viable solutions, such as allocating to high-dividend products like JEPQ, for groups facing real-life difficulties (like insufficient retirement funds). Overall, this session not only deepened the theory of asset allocation but also closely integrated the practical financial needs of different life stages, once again emphasizing the core investment principles of long-term holding, risk control, and cash is king.</p>

      <description>In this session, Teacher James delves into the concept of &amp;#39;antifragility&amp;#39; in investing, emphasizing the importance of holding for the long term and being fearless of market volatility. By contrasting the vast difference between borrowing for consumption versus spending principal, he explains the wealth-magnifying effect of using leverage wisely. Additionally, for retirees and near-retirees, he stresses the core role of maintaining a cash flow reserve for over 15 years. Through two real-life family financial case studies, he analyzes the pitfalls of bank-offered wealth management products and how to make safer, smarter asset allocations for elders and oneself.</description>

<p>The core of this session is to build an <strong>&ldquo;antifragile&rdquo;</strong> investment system. Teacher James points out that true financial freedom comes not from predicting the market, but from establishing a robust structure that can withstand and even benefit from market changes. This includes cultivating a long-term mindset that &ldquo;the market has no top, it will only go higher,&rdquo; and understanding that the permanent loss of missing out on gains is far greater than the risk of temporary downturns. Through specific examples and calculations, the teacher demonstrates the immense impact of using leverage wisely (such as credit loans, stock pledges) versus spending down principal on long-term wealth. He also provides clear guidance on cash reserves and asset allocation for different life stages, especially for those approaching retirement, aiming to help everyone evolve their investment cognition and achieve true financial security and freedom.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fearlessness Towards Market Volatility</strong>: Market shocks and international situations are irrelevant to long-term investors. The market has no peak; it will continuously set new highs. The biggest risk for an investor is not a short-term decline, but missing out on long-term growth due to hesitation, the latter being a permanent loss.</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Snowball Effect&rdquo; of Investing</strong>: The essence of Warren Buffett&rsquo;s &ldquo;long runway and thick snow&rdquo; is persistence. The initial years of investing (the first 4-5 years) may not show significant results, which is the most difficult stage. But once the asset &ldquo;snowball&rdquo; grows larger, the subsequent growth is astonishing. The key is to adhere to the principle of &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, and never sell,&rdquo; regardless of market conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of Scams</strong>: The teacher once again called out a scam account with the ID &ldquo;Pan,&rdquo; which impersonates him to contact students privately and has very few subscribers (35). The teacher emphasized that he would never initiate private contact with anyone, and any unsolicited contact offering managed account services is a scam.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Definition of &ldquo;Antifragility&rdquo;</strong>: Antifragility refers to a system&rsquo;s ability not only to withstand risks but also to benefit from drastic environmental changes and disasters.</li>
<li><strong>The Fragility of Professions</strong>: Many seemingly stable, high-paying professions, such as engineers and doctors, are actually fragile. The more specialized a profession, the harder it is to transition. Once a disruptive change occurs in the industry (like the emergence of AI), they may face the risk of unemployment.</li>
<li><strong>Investing is the Ultimate Antifragility</strong>: In contrast, capital is antifragile. It works 24/7 and cannot be fired. Therefore, everyone should evolve through investing to possess the ability to withstand unknown risks. The biggest risk in investing is &ldquo;the risk of not knowing that risk exists.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Thought Experiment</strong>: Assume you have a principal of $5 million with an 18% annualized return over 40 years.
<ol>
<li><strong>Borrowing for Consumption Model</strong>: Borrow $100,000 annually for living expenses at a 6% interest rate. After 40 years, the $5 million principal will grow to $375 million, while the total debt will be approximately $16 million. The final net worth would be a staggering <strong>$359 million</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Spending Principal Model</strong>: Spend $100,000 from the principal each year. After 40 years, the assets will only grow to <strong>$189 million</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In the long run, those who borrow to spend have nearly double the assets of those who spend their principal. The longer the time frame, the larger the gap. This reflects the hierarchical difference between being &ldquo;tycoon-level rich&rdquo; and merely &ldquo;wealthy.&rdquo; For young people, using credit to invest (like &ldquo;Han Xin gathering his troops&rdquo;) could add an extra hundred million to their future assets.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Case One: The Trap of a NT$300 Million Land Plot</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: Land inherited from an elder appreciated to NT$300 million, but the family had no cash flow. A bank stepped in and designed a complex financial plan: mortgage the land for a NT$170 million loan, use part of the funds to buy high-risk bonds from an Arabian oil company, then pledge the bonds, set up a trust, have the brothers take out another NT$30 million loan, etc., in a layered structure.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: The entire family was trapped by the bank&rsquo;s scheme, burdened with huge debts, yet still generated no cash flow. Their assets faced a massive risk of being hollowed out by the bank.</li>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Advice</strong>: Immediately terminate the cooperation with the bank and redeem everything. The simplest and most direct method is for the elder to sell the land to a developer and get NT$300 million in cash. After taxes, there would still be about NT$200 million in liquid assets. This money could be allocated as 70% stocks and 30% cash. This would not only generate cash flow but also allow for easy handling of inheritance tax in the future through &ldquo;in-kind payment,&rdquo; avoiding being exploited by the bank layer by layer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Case Two: Financial Planning for a Near-Retiree</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: A 62-year-old friend with a mortgage-free house, NT$40 million in cash (later clarified to have total assets of NT$60 million), and annual expenses of NT$1 million, was considering a &ldquo;Wealth Management Mortgage&rdquo; (Home Equity Loan) for investment.</li>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Advice</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Strongly Opposed</strong>: For those near or in retirement, borrowing with a short-term wealth management mortgage (e.g., renewed every 2-5 years) is extremely risky. If the bank refuses to renew the loan and demands repayment during a market downturn, it would lead to catastrophic consequences.</li>
<li><strong>The Only Exception</strong>: If you must take out a loan, it must be a long-term one with a contract period of at least 15 years (for example, some banks like DBS offer loans until age 75). This is because a 15-year cycle is long enough for the market to recover from any low point.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion for This Case</strong>: The friend has NT$60 million in assets and annual expenses of NT$1 million, resulting in a withdrawal rate of only 1.67%. This is entirely sufficient for living; there is absolutely no need to take the risk of borrowing. If you have enough money, don&rsquo;t borrow. If you don&rsquo;t have enough, you shouldn&rsquo;t borrow either. Older individuals should prioritize being conservative.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing:
<ol>
<li>As a 30-year-old, she shared her journey from having no concept of financial management to a complete mindset shift after reading and watching the teacher&rsquo;s videos. A project suspension last year gave her a lot of free time, during which she began exploring personal and spiritual growth and was introduced to basic financial knowledge.</li>
<li>She believes the biggest change was a &ldquo;shift in thought.&rdquo; Teacher James&rsquo;s philosophy, &ldquo;Wealth is a birthright, happiness is a human right,&rdquo; first requires establishing a new belief system. Many people don&rsquo;t believe ordinary individuals can achieve financial freedom because their old beliefs limit them.</li>
<li>She observed that the mentality of seeking quick results through short-term trading is rooted in the same &ldquo;sense of scarcity&rdquo; as the anxiety of rushing to find a job and being unable to tolerate career gaps. Stepping back and slowing down, however, can lead to more valuable methods.</li>
<li>After accepting the mindset that &ldquo;I am already a millionaire,&rdquo; she found her words and actions became more composed, and she no longer felt a sense of material lack. She believes that before learning the specific operational details, it is crucial to first mentally accept that one can be &ldquo;both wealthy and free.&rdquo;</li>

<li>He started following the teacher&rsquo;s lessons around 2019-2020. At the time, he believed in the philosophy but didn&rsquo;t have much capital. He owned three rental properties in the US, which had low cash flow and soaring maintenance costs after the pandemic.</li>
<li>Inspired by the teacher&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;selling the houses,&rdquo; he made a firm decision and sold all three properties within 22 months. Although he paid a substantial amount in capital gains tax, he viewed tax as a cost and felt a sense of relief after selling.</li>
<li>He invested the proceeds into a brokerage account, not getting bogged down in precise calculations but following the principle of being &ldquo;vaguely right.&rdquo; Last December, while traveling, he casually checked his account and was astonished to find his assets had reached 50 times his annual expenses. He decided to officially retire this year.</li>
<li>His takeaways are: be patient, as the market is generous; dare to sell rental properties; and continue learning, because the teacher&rsquo;s instruction is also constantly evolving.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: The market is very generous. For someone like Li with a solid foundation, five years of serious investing can be enough to retire. For young people starting from scratch, they can be well-off in ten years, wealthy in twenty, and tycoons in thirty. Real estate is like being a &ldquo;slave in a shell&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s a shackle that shouldn&rsquo;t be carried.</li>

<li>Question: He shared backtesting data on an &ldquo;elastic rebalancing&rdquo; strategy. The strategy involves, when cash reserves are less than 15 years, not using cash in a down year but instead converting a portion of a standard ETF (like QQQ) into a leveraged ETF. In an up year, a portion of the leveraged ETF is converted back to cash. His conclusion was that the backtest didn&rsquo;t reveal a single optimal parameter. The most stable strategy remains, at the start of retirement for a given Beta value, to allocate the highest possible percentage to cash.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The conclusion is correct. For the same Beta value, always choose the allocation with the higher cash percentage. Rebalancing should be &ldquo;vaguely right,&rdquo; not overly precise. When the market is doing well, move more profits into cash to &ldquo;build your fortress walls higher&rdquo; to defend against future risks.</li>

<li>At the time, her husband was day-trading in his retirement account, resulting in a $200,000 loss. He refused to sell, believing &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a real loss until you sell.&rdquo;</li>
<li>She eventually took matters into her own hands, sold all the stocks that were down 80%, and invested the entire amount into QQQ and TQQQ. In just one year, she not only recovered the $200,000 loss but also made an additional $80,000.</li>

<li>He has been practicing &ldquo;Han Xin gathering his troops&rdquo; by investing with credit loans and is currently approaching the credit limit in Taiwan.</li>

<li>Question: His mother is expected to have about NT$10 million after selling her house. Her annual expenses are not high, but the amount isn&rsquo;t sufficient to support living off a pledged loan. How should this money be allocated for his mother&rsquo;s living expenses? Is it feasible to invest it all in a high-dividend ETF like 0056?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I recommend keeping NT$1 million as an emergency fund and investing the remaining NT$9 million entirely into 0056. Assuming a 6% dividend yield, that&rsquo;s NT$540,000 a year, or NT$45,000 a month, which is much higher than rental income. This way, the elder has money to spend, feels secure, and will be happier and live longer. Moreover, converting real estate into liquid assets will make handling inheritance much simpler in the future.</li>

<li>Question: A 60-year-old friend has NT$7.5 million in cash and NT$18 million in high-dividend ETFs (yielding NT$1.6 million annually). Annual living expenses are NT$2 million. They are considering a 70/30 or 433 allocation and using a NT$7 million line of credit from a wealth management mortgage.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Absolutely not. First, your assets are insufficient to support NT$2 million in annual spending. At a 6% dividend yield, you would need a NT$33 million principal to generate NT$2 million in cash flow; your total assets are only NT$25.5 million. Second, you are already 60 years old; you absolutely must not use a wealth management mortgage, the risk is too high. Your only option is to keep about NT$1.5 million in cash and invest the remaining NT$24 million entirely into a high-dividend ETF like 0056. Live off the dividends, and spend only what you have.</li>

<li>Question: He finds leveraged fund rebalancing strategies a bit complex and worries if he can execute them strictly in his old age, or if he can teach them clearly to the next generation. Furthermore, when he does rebalance, he feels internal conflict, thinking, &ldquo;What if the market keeps going up?&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This method is not complex at all; what&rsquo;s complex is your mind. You struggle because &ldquo;your mind abides in something&rdquo; (心有所住), clinging to potential outcomes, which &ldquo;gives rise to inner demons&rdquo; (心生魔障). The solution is spiritual practice, to achieve a state where you can &ldquo;let the mind arise without abiding anywhere.&rdquo; This is just simple arithmetic; do what needs to be done.</li>

<p>&ldquo;Downturns are always temporary; only uptrends are forever. So your loss might be momentary&hellip; but if you miss out on the gains, that&rsquo;s a permanent loss.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This view emphasizes that in long-term investing, the opportunity cost (missing the upside) is far more detrimental than the paper losses from short-term market corrections.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The more specialized your profession, the more fragile you are&hellip; The only thing that is antifragile is investing.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This view explains the concept of &ldquo;antifragility,&rdquo; pointing out that highly specialized careers are very risky in the face of industry disruption, whereas capital investment has the inherent ability to continuously adapt to change.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The unfolding of our lives is actually based on our own mindset. Whatever you believe the world to be, that is what it will become for you.&rdquo;
&ndash; Mao Mao</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This insight shares the importance of personal mindset transformation, suggesting that believing you can be wealthy is the first step toward achieving financial freedom.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay in a broken elevator. We need to find a good one.&rdquo;
&ndash; TBOS (quoting Teacher James)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This metaphor illustrates that in investing, one should decisively abandon underperforming individual stocks (the broken elevator) and move to index funds with long-term upward trends (the good elevator).</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Tax is not the point. The point is that the assets should be able to appreciate, and the elders should be able to spend the money.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This point, made when discussing how to handle elders&rsquo; assets, suggests that the core goals should be increasing asset value and improving the elders&rsquo; quality of life, rather than being overly fixated on potential future inheritance taxes.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Because your mind abides in something, your mind is attached, and thus demons will arise.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This view responds to a student&rsquo;s concern about strategy complexity from a philosophical perspective, pointing out that fear and indecision in investing stem from internal attachments, not from the strategy itself.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The house collapses, but the mortgage payments continue.&rdquo;
&ndash; Fu You Shi Tian Fu &amp; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This statement, drawn from a real disaster case, reveals the immense risk of real estate as an asset. Not only can its value drop to zero, but the associated debt does not disappear with it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Usually, people who say they don&rsquo;t keep cash are the poor ones&hellip; Cash is air.&rdquo;
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This vivid analogy emphasizes the critical importance of cash reserves for investment survival, especially in retirement planning, where it serves as a lifeline against risk.</p></blockquote>

<p>This gathering provided a deep dive into the core elements of building an &ldquo;antifragile&rdquo; investment system. From macro-level mindset to specific operational tactics, Teacher James once again stressed the belief and discipline required for long-term investing. By comparing the case of borrowing for consumption versus spending principal, he clearly illustrated the vast difference in wealth growth paths. For investors at different stages, especially near-retirees, the teacher offered prudent advice on cash reserves and loan risks, using two vivid family financial cases to expose the traps and enlightened paths in the financial market. The students&rsquo; sharings were also exceptionally insightful, ranging from transformations in personal journeys and the practical application of selling property to invest, to the integration of Zen meditation with investment philosophy, fully demonstrating the community members&rsquo; shared growth in both wealth and spirit. The entire discussion was not just a lesson in investment strategy but a profound exchange on life planning and spiritual cultivation.</p>

      <description>In this session, Teacher James elaborates on the core strategies of asset allocation and withdrawal rates for those who are retired or nearing retirement, emphasizing that &amp;#39;survival&amp;#39; is more important than chasing high returns. The content covers portfolio construction with different cash ratios (30%, 40%, 50%), maximum Beta value limits, and corresponding safe withdrawal rates. It also delves into topics like stock pledging, investment mindset, and the outlook for the AI era. The student sharing segment is rich with content, ranging from the joy of financial growth through practice to discussions on specific financial decisions (like buying a car or investing with a loan).</description>

<p>The core theme of this session is <strong>constructing a robust asset allocation strategy for retired or near-retired individuals with &lsquo;survival&rsquo; as the primary goal</strong>. The central idea is that financial planning in retirement should prioritize the stability and longevity of cash flow over maximizing investment returns. Teacher James explains in detail how to set the portfolio&rsquo;s risk exposure (Beta value) based on different levels of cash reserves (30%, 40%, 50%) and, accordingly, determine a safe annual withdrawal rate. The aim is to ensure one can weather even extreme market conditions, such as a 15-year-long bear market.</p>

<p>Teacher James proposed three cash-based asset allocation models for retirees with different financial situations and risk tolerances:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>30% Cash Allocation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highest Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 1.0)</strong>: The remaining 70% of assets can be allocated as 40% in an index fund (like QQQ) and 30% in a leveraged fund (like TQQQ).</li>
<li><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate</strong>: With this allocation, a maximum of <strong>2%</strong> of total assets can be withdrawn annually for living expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.7)</strong>: If the portfolio consists of 70% in an index fund with no leverage, the withdrawal rate can be increased to <strong>3%</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: The higher the asset volatility, the lower the withdrawal rate must be to prevent excessive asset depletion during a market downturn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>40% Cash Allocation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.9)</strong>: The remaining 60% of assets can be allocated with a maximum of 30% in an index fund and 30% in a leveraged fund.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate</strong>: With this allocation, a maximum of <strong>3%</strong> can be withdrawn annually.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.6)</strong>: If the portfolio is 40% index and 20% leveraged, the withdrawal rate can be increased to <strong>4%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>50% Cash Allocation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.7)</strong>: The remaining 50% of assets can be allocated with a maximum of 30% in an index fund and 20% in a leveraged fund.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate</strong>: With this allocation, <strong>4%</strong> can be withdrawn annually.</li>
<li><strong>No-Leverage Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.5)</strong>: If the allocation is 50% cash and 50% index fund, the withdrawal rate can be increased to <strong>5%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ultimate Goal: 15 Years of Cash Reserves</strong>
<ul>
<li>The most ideal state is to hold enough cash at a market high to cover living expenses for the next 15 years. Considering that cash itself earns interest (e.g., 3.5%), one might only need to prepare 12-13 years&rsquo; worth of principal to last for 15 years.</li>
<li>If this cannot be achieved initially, cash can be gradually accumulated through rebalancing when the market goes up until the 15-year goal is met or exceeded.</li>
<li>Only when cash reserves exceed 15 years of living expenses can the surplus be used to buy the dip during a market downturn, ensuring that &ldquo;survival&rdquo; remains the top priority.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investing is Learned, Not Taught</strong>: James quotes the concept of &ldquo;The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao,&rdquo; emphasizing that investment philosophy must be personally contemplated, understood, and practiced to be truly internalized. Like riding a bicycle, no amount of reading can replace getting on the bike and trying. He encourages everyone to use their hands and minds to explore and comprehend for themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Rethinking Stock Pledging</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Evolution of Concept</strong>: In the past, to avoid sacrificing returns by holding cash (used for pledging), it was recommended to pair it with leveraged funds. Now, the emphasis is more on &ldquo;stability&rdquo; and &ldquo;survival.&rdquo; Therefore, even without chasing the highest returns, a no-leverage portfolio of 50% cash and 50% index fund can still be used for a pledged-asset line of credit.</li>
<li><strong>Pledging Risk Warning</strong>: The teacher used an example to explain why even a seemingly low borrowing ratio (e.g., 10%) could lead to bankruptcy. Suppose you borrow $100,000 against $1 million in assets. During a prolonged bear market of 10 years (like 2000-2009, when the market fell 85%), the $100,000 loan plus interest could grow to $160,000, while your assets might shrink to just $150,000, at which point you would be insolvent. This highlights the importance of holding sufficient cash (e.g., 30%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow is the Lifeline</strong>: An anecdote about an individual with over 100 million TWD in assets who fell into a cash flow crisis after buying a 75 million TWD mansion serves as a warning that regardless of asset size, a lack of cash flow management can lead to bankruptcy risk.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: She started listening to the teacher&rsquo;s classes in April 2021. Although she&rsquo;s a slow learner, she has saved $100,000 in the past 20 months despite a modest salary, which makes her very surprised and happy. She has already reduced her portfolio&rsquo;s Beta from 1.3 to around 1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Her car is in poor condition. Should she spend $1,000 to fix it and drive for a few more years, or buy a Tesla to improve her quality of life? Although she&rsquo;s tempted, she feels she is still in the early stages of wealth accumulation.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: He advises spending the $1,000 to fix the car. Since her total assets are not yet substantial, buying a fifty or sixty-thousand-dollar car would be too high a percentage of her total assets. At this stage, she should continue to invest her funds. The teacher suggests she cleverly use credit cards, such as an Apple Card or American Express with 2%-3% cash back, and invest all the rewards into TQQQ, thereby &ldquo;getting richer as you spend.&rdquo; At the same time, he shared a personal regret. Due to his frugality, when he took his mother to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, she hesitated to take more dishes to be considerate of him, a memory that he later deeply regretted. Therefore, while buying a car is not recommended, one should not be overly frugal on crucial matters like showing filial piety to parents.</li>

<li>She shared a personal insight, viewing the wealth growth in her account as &ldquo;a grace from heaven and the teacher&rsquo;s enlightenment.&rdquo; Because this money was &ldquo;originally nothing,&rdquo; her heart is filled with gratitude.</li>
<li>During the recent floods in Hualien, her family suggested making a donation. She sold a portion of her gains from 00670L (a 2x leveraged ETF) to donate, which she calls &ldquo;charitable rebalancing.&rdquo; She felt very happy donating it because the money was never &ldquo;hers&rdquo; to begin with.

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: After listening to a Buddhist dharma talk, she associated Teacher James&rsquo;s teachings with helping people &ldquo;escape the cycle of poverty,&rdquo; which filled her with a &ldquo;mind of reverence.&rdquo; She shared her recent action: she resolutely terminated a losing insurance policy, got back $24,000, and immediately invested it using the teacher&rsquo;s method. She believes that although it&rsquo;s a short-term loss, it&rsquo;s more important to cut losses in time and get on the right &ldquo;elevator,&rdquo; as she can earn it back in the coming years. She also began to ponder the deeper meaning of the teacher&rsquo;s emphasis on &ldquo;reserving 15 years of cash,&rdquo; understanding it&rsquo;s to ensure that one can both live without worry and navigate through a long bear market via rebalancing.</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: He explained the &ldquo;15 years of cash&rdquo; concept in detail. It is mainly for retired individuals with no source of income. The calculation is: annual expenses minus fixed income (like social security), then multiply the amount you need to cover by 15. For example, if you need to provide $50,000 yourself annually, you need to prepare $750,000 in cash. This standard is based on the historical experience of 2000-2015, where the market might have taken 15 years to return to its high. For those still working, they can dynamically replenish cash with their monthly salary and don&rsquo;t need to strictly sell stocks for rebalancing.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is a &ldquo;veteran student&rdquo; who has been following the teacher since 2011. He believes that new students today are very fortunate because the teacher&rsquo;s current investment strategy (indexing, long-term holding, automation) has evolved to its &ldquo;most perfect moment.&rdquo; He recalled that in the early years, the teacher&rsquo;s methods included individual stock picking and active trading. While it was possible to avoid major crashes, it was difficult for ordinary people to follow, and the after-tax returns were not ideal. Many old students missed out on the later, more optimized strategies because they didn&rsquo;t continue learning. He himself, based on the teacher&rsquo;s latest retirement calculation method in late 2023, found that he had enough to retire. He officially retired in January 2024 and now lives a wonderful life, with his investment income even exceeding his previous salary.</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: He thanked Dr. An for his sharing. He compared his early investment teaching to an &ldquo;expeditionary force,&rdquo; with heavy casualties and few who could keep up. Now, because online teaching doesn&rsquo;t allow for real-time command of tens of thousands of students, the strategy had to evolve into a &ldquo;space force&rdquo;—a fully automated model with no manual intervention. The pandemic accelerated this transformation. He praised Dr. An for not only keeping up but also implementing advanced operations like stock pledging and Roth conversions.</li>

<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Since he is nearly 10 years away from retirement, he can absolutely adopt a more aggressive strategy. He can maintain a Beta of 1.0 and &ldquo;not rebalance&rdquo; for the next few years, letting his profits run. This might naturally increase his Beta to 1.3 or even 1.5.

<li><strong>Question</strong>: At the age of 30-something, how can one better &ldquo;exchange money for spiritual energy&rdquo;?

<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The core of spiritual energy is &ldquo;vision&rdquo; and &ldquo;capacity of mind.&rdquo; You should practice a mindset: imagine you suddenly have 20 billion. If your lifestyle and mentality remain unchanged, then your spiritual energy is strong enough. True financial freedom is when &ldquo;money&rdquo; disappears from your life. It becomes like air, natural. When you consume, you no longer consider the price, only the value and experience. This is what frees you from trivial matters, allowing your spiritual energy to grow stronger.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>:
<ol>
<li>If, after retiring and starting to withdraw via pledging for 3 years, his cash reserves reach the 15-year level, does he need to prepare 18 years of cash to be safe, considering the 3 years of living expenses already borrowed?</li>
<li>When the teacher retired at 42, did he already have the concept of living off a pledged-asset line of credit? What was the inspiration for this idea?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>No, it&rsquo;s not necessary. Because after a few years of market growth, your total asset size will be much larger than at the beginning. The growth in assets will be more than enough to cover the borrowed portion, making your safety cushion even thicker.</li>
<li>It was an evolutionary process. He didn&rsquo;t know about it when he retired; he discovered it later. In 2018, he needed money but didn&rsquo;t want to sell stocks and pay high taxes, so he proactively emailed his brokerage to ask if he could borrow against his stocks. The brokerage immediately set up a pledged-asset loan for him.

If her assets are large enough that she can live comfortably even after an 80% market drop, then her choice is also a viable path.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He discussed the huge impact of Sora 2 and shared the experience of his small group getting rich together by sticking to their philosophy.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: He saw an analyst mention that Stablecoin would bring a $3 trillion business opportunity. How is this figure estimated? Does this reflect the strength of the US economy?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The US dollar itself is an &ldquo;aggressive currency,&rdquo; exchanging paper money for the real assets of other countries. Stablecoin increases the efficiency of this &ldquo;aggression&rdquo; by at least 10 times because it can bypass central banks and the SWIFT system, penetrating directly into the general populace. This will cause more countries to lose their monetary sovereignty. The significant increase in the circulation of the US dollar will bring enormous interest income to US financial institutions. The $3 trillion estimate might even be conservative. This is a silent &ldquo;capitalist war.&rdquo;</li>

He shared practical advice for mainland investors operating in Hong Kong: invest in the Hong Kong-listed 03086 (CSOP NASDAQ-100 ETF), put the cash portion in an accumulating money market fund, and hold leveraged ETFs in a US brokerage to avoid tax information exchange issues.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: She is a new student who has been following for three to four months. By investing in 513100 (an A-share traded Nasdaq 100 ETF), her profits can already cover two years of expenses, giving her an early taste of financial freedom.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>:
<ol>
<li>She admits to being impatient. How can she maintain patience like the teacher?</li>
<li>She has a 70/30 (stock/cash) allocation and 15 years of cash for expenses. How should she rebalance after retirement?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>He himself has a quick temper but is always practicing. The key is to practice &ldquo;empathy.&rdquo; Before a conversation, silently repeat three times, &ldquo;He is right, I am wrong.&rdquo; When you place yourself in the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; position, you won&rsquo;t get so agitated, and the communication will be more effective.</li>
<li>If you still have income, use the income to maintain the ratio. If you are fully retired, simply withdraw one year&rsquo;s living expenses from the cash portion annually. If the market goes up, let your cash reserves naturally grow to, say, 20 years. When the market falls, use the portion above your 15-16 year baseline to buy stocks.</li>

<li>As long as you have sufficient cash reserves, a Beta over 1 doesn&rsquo;t need to be addressed.</li>
<li>If you have a need for money in all three places, keeping the accounts is convenient. The key consideration is the inheritance laws in each location to ensure heirs can inherit the assets smoothly.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: She plans to return to China in 6 years and understands that Hong Kong is the most favorable place for stock pledging. However, there is an annual foreign exchange quota of only $50,000, making capital transfer slow. How should she plan for this?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: First, pledging assets in the US carries risks for non-long-term residents, as the account could be closed. Therefore, gradually moving funds to Hong Kong is the right direction.

</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mother</strong>: Sell everything and buy 0056 (a Taiwanese high-dividend ETF). Live off the dividends, and reinvest any surplus.</li>
<li><strong>Yourself and Husband</strong>: Sell all stocks (the 30+ holdings) and bonds. Create a portfolio of 70% 00662 (Fubon NASDAQ) and 30% 00865B (Cathay 20-Year US Treasury Bond ETF).</li>
<li><strong>Son</strong>: Just started working with a stable income. All spare cash should go into 00662. There is no need to hold cash at this stage.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-sale Home</strong>: The best strategy is to sell it as soon as possible after taking possession. If for self-occupancy, try to pay only the interest on the mortgage, not the principal.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Sub-brokerage Accounts</strong>: He recommends liquidating them all. Using Taiwanese sub-brokerage accounts to hold US stocks could face US estate tax issues in the future, and there is also the alternative minimum tax system for overseas income. It is simpler to invest directly in local Taiwanese ETFs.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>For retirement, what matters is cash flow, not rate of return. Return is secondary; survival is the most important thing.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This viewpoint was a common thread throughout the session and is the cornerstone of this asset allocation strategy, reminding retirees to place financial security above return growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. &hellip; The true Tao is the one you comprehend for yourself. Everything spoken is just the surface, the written words of a martial arts manual.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher emphasizes the importance of independent thinking and personal practice in investing. Knowledge must be internalized to become true wisdom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A peanut for your parents while they&rsquo;re alive is worth more than a whole pig on the altar after they&rsquo;re gone. (Taiwanese proverb)
&ndash; Teacher James (Quoted by Jenny during her sharing)</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher uses this vivid metaphor to stress that filial piety and care should be expressed while loved ones are still alive; their value far exceeds lavish memorials after they have passed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don&rsquo;t reduce volatility by changing your investment vehicle; you reduce volatility by holding cash. Low long-term return is the real risk.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>A concise point made by the teacher when answering his daughter&rsquo;s question, pointing out that the correct way to handle market volatility is to adjust the cash ratio, not to sacrifice long-term returns by choosing a less volatile asset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to first tell yourself that he is right, and I am wrong. &hellip; Why would someone who is wrong be so loud? This will make you reflect.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher&rsquo;s method for practicing patience, shared when answering how to maintain it. By first acknowledging the other person&rsquo;s validity, one can effectively de-escalate one&rsquo;s own emotions and achieve more peaceful communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never pay back borrowed money. This is very important. If you intend to pay back the money from a pledged-asset line, you shouldn&rsquo;t have borrowed it in the first place.
&ndash; Benson &amp; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Benson&rsquo;s sharing and the teacher&rsquo;s confirmation highlight the core essence of stock pledging: the borrowed money is a tool for living expenses or reinvestment. The goal is to ensure the cash-flow-generating asset is never depleted, thus &ldquo;repaying the principal&rdquo; is an incorrect operation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When investing doesn&rsquo;t exist, the market doesn&rsquo;t exist, and money doesn&rsquo;t exist, that&rsquo;s when your spiritual energy is at its peak.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher describes the highest state of financial freedom. When wealth is so abundant that one no longer needs to think or worry about money itself, one can attain true spiritual freedom.</p>

<p>This session was an extremely profound and practical lesson on retirement financial planning. Teacher James has evolved from his previous focus on &ldquo;the highest return under safe conditions&rdquo; to a more conservative strategy centered on &ldquo;absolute safety,&rdquo; providing a clear and actionable guide to asset allocation and withdrawal rates for those approaching or in retirement. Through the detailed breakdown of the 30%, 40%, and 50% cash allocation models, individuals in different financial situations can find a suitable &ldquo;survival&rdquo; plan. The numerous student sharings in the Q&amp;A session, from the &ldquo;then and now&rdquo; comparisons of veteran students to the &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moments and practical applications of new students, vividly demonstrated how this investment philosophy can change the financial destinies and life outlooks of different people. The entire session was not just a transmission of investment techniques but a deep exchange on views about wealth, risk, and life wisdom.</p>
