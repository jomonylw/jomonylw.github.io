      <description>In this session, James elaborates on the three &amp;#39;Seven Levels&amp;#39; theories of investment learning, wealth accumulation, and investment operations, providing an in-depth exploration of the complete path from beginner to the wealthy class. He also shares insights on the impact of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) era on our lives and investments, emphasizing that long-term holding of the Nasdaq-100 index fund, combined with asset allocation and stock pledging, is the ultimate strategy for achieving financial freedom and life&amp;#39;s purpose.</description>

<p>This session delves into multiple dimensions of investment and wealth. The core ideas revolve around three &ldquo;Seven Levels&rdquo; theories:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Seven Levels of Investment Learning</strong>: The journey from initial exposure to forming an unwavering belief.</li>
<li><strong>The Seven Levels of Wealth Accumulation</strong>: The path from understanding investment to maximizing wealth through concentration, leverage, tax savings, and longevity.</li>
<li><strong>The Seven Levels of Investment Operations</strong>: From the confusion of short-term trading to finally embracing the wealthy class strategy of &ldquo;invest only in indexes, never sell, and live off pledged assets.&rdquo;
The course emphasizes that true wealth stems from correct cognition and discipline, and points out that in the AI era, we should use technology to liberate ourselves and return to the essence of life, rather than becoming busier.</li>
</ol>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore Short-Term Volatility</strong>: The market has been highly volatile recently due to events like US-China tariffs and a potential US government shutdown, but investors should ignore this market noise and avoid making incorrect moves. Typically, any action based on short-term predictions is wrong.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Technical Analysis</strong>: The accuracy of technical analysis is about the same as a coin toss, roughly 50/50, and should not be the primary basis for investment decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Responsibility in Investing</strong>: Investment sharing is for experience exchange only and does not constitute advice. Everyone&rsquo;s financial situation is different; final decisions require personal learning and execution, for which individuals are responsible.</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="relative group">The Impact of AI and the Evolution of Investment Philosophy

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Makes the Impossible Possible, But Also Makes People Busier</strong>: Technological advancements like AI have made things previously unimaginable (such as quickly creating multilingual videos) possible. However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean people become more idle; on the contrary, they become busier because there are more things they can do.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage Using AI to Spread Correct Investment Philosophies</strong>: Students can use AI tools like NotebookLM or ChatGPT to translate investment philosophies into articles or videos in different languages, helping to &ldquo;inform&rdquo; more people of their right to be wealthy.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Philosophy is Evolving DNA</strong>: Our investment philosophy is constantly evolving and being optimized. For example, it was once emphasized that those who pledge assets &ldquo;must&rdquo; allocate to leveraged funds to maintain returns. The current view, however, is that for the sake of stability, one can pledge assets without holding leveraged funds. Students need to keep up with their learning to avoid sticking to outdated knowledge, as the investment world is like biological evolution—ceasing to evolve risks being eliminated.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Seven Levels of Investment Learning</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hearing</strong>: Just encountering the information, possibly thinking it&rsquo;s a scam.</li>
<li><strong>Knowing</strong>: Beginning to realize there&rsquo;s substance to it.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding</strong>: Developing cognition after in-depth research.</li>
<li><strong>Believing</strong>: Transitioning from cognition to trust.</li>
<li><strong>Executing</strong>: Putting belief into action, the key being &ldquo;buy when you have money, immediately, at market price.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Enduring</strong>: Being able to withstand the pain and hold on when the market drops by 40% or even more.</li>
<li><strong>Faith</strong>: Reaching a state of inner peace where market fluctuations don&rsquo;t matter. This is usually built on proper asset allocation and sufficient cash flow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Seven Levels of Wealth (Differences in Magnitude)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knowing How to Invest vs. Not Knowing</strong>: This is the first dividing line, separating 90% of the world&rsquo;s population.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Correctly vs. Incorrectly</strong>: Among those who know how to invest, choosing the most efficient assets (e.g., QQQ vs. VOO/VT) can result in a hundredfold difference in assets over the long term.</li>
<li><strong>Han Xin Deploying Troops (Concentrating Capital)</strong>: Concentrating funds in the highest-return assets instead of diversifying into inefficient products like insurance, annuities, and bonds can create another hundredfold gap in assets.</li>
<li><strong>Pledging and Borrowing</strong>: Learning to use stock pledging to obtain liquidity instead of selling assets widens the asset gap again.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing Without Repaying</strong>: Understanding that a pledge loan is an expansion of assets, not a traditional debt that needs to be repaid. Compared to those who rush to repay, the potential for wealth growth is entirely different.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Tax Savings</strong>: Through legal tax planning (like Roth Conversions in the US), one can save enormous amounts in taxes, further widening the wealth gap.</li>
<li><strong>Longevity</strong>: When all the above are done correctly, the longer you live, the more significant the compounding effect, and the more assets you accumulate. Longevity is the key determinant of ultimate wealth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Seven Levels of Investment Operations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level One</strong>: New to the market, occasionally making money on individual stocks, thinking investing is easy.</li>
<li><strong>Level Two</strong>: Trying derivatives like options, possibly profiting in the short term, but likely losing money in the long run.</li>
<li><strong>Level Three</strong>: Starting to study financial reports and industry trends, trying to buy low and sell high, but the more you know, the more you lose.</li>
<li><strong>Level Four</strong>: Obsessed with technical analysis and futures, engaging in frantic short-term trading, thinking you&rsquo;re a stock market guru, but actually being closest to bankruptcy.</li>
<li><strong>Level Five</strong>: Understanding that investing is about sharing in a company&rsquo;s growth and knowing how to pick good companies, but still suffering from the huge volatility of individual stocks. You work like a dog for mediocre returns.</li>
<li><strong>Level Six</strong>: Grasping the power of long-term holding and starting to make big profits, but still needing to constantly research and switch companies. Having cash on hand after selling becomes a new source of anxiety. It&rsquo;s still a busy operational life.</li>
<li><strong>Level Seven (The Ultimate)</strong>: Investing only in index funds (QQQ). Buy whenever you have money, never sell, buy with your eyes closed. Implement proper asset allocation (e.g., 433), keep enough cash, and fear no market crash. Live off loans from stock pledging and never repay them, allowing assets to continuously generate wealth. This is the true wealthy class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Astonishing Power of Compounding</strong>: Using the example of investing NT$10,000 per month, at an 18% annualized return, it can grow to NT$547 million in 40 years. This shows that becoming wealthy is achievable for ordinary people; it is a &ldquo;God-given&rdquo; right. The key is whether one is informed and takes action.</li>
<li><strong>The Nature of Work and the Meaning of Life</strong>: Our lives should not be solely for work and survival. Viewing one&rsquo;s job as the entirety of life is a form of enslavement by capitalism. Only after being free from work pressure can one truly understand what &ldquo;life&rdquo; is and pursue what one loves, like gardening or enjoying a pastoral life.</li>
<li><strong>The Risks of Leveraged ETFs</strong>: One must deeply understand the nature of leveraged ETFs (like TQQQ). They can bring tenfold returns in the short term but can also drop to zero (a 99.999% decline) in a single major crash. Therefore, their risk must be managed through asset allocation and rebalancing; never go all-in.</li>

<li>Share: She recently heard a story that Tony Robbins suggests two things for success: first, imitate someone you want to become; second, practice positive meditation daily. She applied this to herself by imitating James, practicing the seven levels of investing step-by-step—from understanding investing and doing it right to pledging assets without repayment—and believes she is on the right path. She also mentioned that Taiwan&rsquo;s inheritance tax is very low.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He agrees that Taiwan&rsquo;s inheritance tax is low (maximum 20%), so there&rsquo;s no need for complex trusts or planning. The best &ldquo;tax avoidance&rdquo; is to &ldquo;have many children and grandchildren&rdquo; and use the annual gift tax exemption to transfer wealth to future generations early, which has an amazing compounding effect. He shared a cautionary tale of a bank deceiving a family into taking out a massive loan to &ldquo;plan&rdquo; for inheritance tax, warning that bank promotions can sometimes be scams.</li>

<li>Share: He has opened Custodial Accounts for his three young children, with a portfolio of 60% QQQ, 20% QLD, and 20% SGOV. He plans to invest small amounts regularly. His goal is not to give them a certain amount of money but to &ldquo;teach them how to fish,&rdquo; allowing them to see the account grow from a young age and giving him the opportunity to teach them the complete financial system in the future, including Pledge Loans. This is both a transfer of wealth and wisdom.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He strongly agrees with this educational approach. He pointed out that gifting early is the best estate planning. For example, giving a daughter $20,000 annually for 40 years could grow to nearly $100 billion at an 18% return, completely tax-free, which is far more significant than worrying about the inheritance tax exemption amount.</li>

<li>Suggested creating a more &ldquo;pure&rdquo; EACC discussion space to avoid mixing with other investment philosophies.</li>

<li>Share: As a long-time student since 2011, he shared several key benefits:
<ol>
<li><strong>Han Xin Deploying Troops</strong>: Following James&rsquo;s advice, he canceled unnecessary investment-linked insurance policies, sold an idle property in Taiwan to invest in US index funds, and did not rush to pay off his mortgage. These three decisions significantly improved his financial situation.</li>
<li><strong>Evolution of Investment Philosophy</strong>: He recalled that he initially only learned to &ldquo;Buy and Hold SPY,&rdquo; which was just 1/5 of the entire system. Now, the system has evolved to include a complete solution with QQQ, Pledge Loans, a 2% withdrawal rate, and 433 asset allocation, which makes him feel more secure and at ease.
. <strong>Unity with Spouse</strong>: He and his wife learn together and are in complete agreement on family financial decisions, which makes execution very smooth. This is a great blessing.</li>

<li>Question: Regarding the Traditional IRA, some suggest holding cash in it so the future tax base is low. But she thought if she put it all in QQQ, although the future tax would be higher, the growth would also be much higher than cash. Isn&rsquo;t that better?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a balance between risk and taxes. James provided a strategy: suppose you convert $100,000 to a Roth account annually. You could buy $100,000 of TQQQ (3x leverage) in the Roth. To balance the risk of the entire portfolio, you could hold $200,000 in cash in your Traditional IRA. This way, your high-growth component (TQQQ) is in the tax-free Roth account, while the cash in the Traditional IRA hedges the risk. This optimizes the tax structure without reducing the overall return potential.</li>

<li>Share: She shared an experience helping a novice investor friend. The friend initially claimed she could tolerate a 50% fluctuation, but when told the loss could last for 3-5 years, she immediately said she couldn&rsquo;t accept it; her bottom line was not losing principal for more than 1-2 years. Through this conversation, Ling deeply realized that everyone&rsquo;s definition of and tolerance for &ldquo;risk&rdquo; is completely different. Before taking any investment action (like buying immediately at market price), the first task is to thoroughly understand what level of risk you can truly bear.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He highly praised Ling&rsquo;s clear logic. He emphasized that knowing your own risk tolerance is the first step in investing, more important than any strategy. He used the 2000 dot-com bubble as an example, where QQQ took 15 years to return to its high, which is why he recommends keeping enough cash for 15-20 years. <strong>&ldquo;Survival is more important than making money.&rdquo;</strong> Before you understand yourself, you should keep more cash; the rate of return is not the top priority.</li>

<li>Question: He raised a macro question about the global &ldquo;de-dollarization&rdquo; trend and central banks hoarding gold. He wanted to know if this poses a long-term threat to an investment strategy centered on US dollar assets and whether we need to prepare for it.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He acknowledged that this trend is real. However, he offered several counterpoints: 1. The US debt problem could be resolved by productivity gains from AI (e.g., an extra 1.5% GDP growth annually). 2. A thought experiment: If the US government announced a &ldquo;ban on using US dollars for gold transactions,&rdquo; the entire dollar-denominated gold market would collapse instantly, and the value of gold hoarded by countries would plummet. The US has many tools left in its toolbox to maintain its hegemony. The disputes between the US and China over chips and rare earths are games between nations and do not affect our long-term confidence in US technological development, which is unrelated to investing in QQQ.</li>

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He recommended buying a Hong Kong-issued product (like 3086), primarily to avoid US inheritance tax. Hong Kong also has a 2x leveraged Nasdaq fund (like CSOP NASDAQ-100 INDEX DAILY (2X) LEVERAGED PRODUCT - 7261) and money market funds that can be used for asset allocation. For his daughter&rsquo;s money, he can buy 513100 in China or a Stock Connect product in Hong Kong.

<ul>
<li>Share: She shared her experience using AI (ChatGPT) to research the tax issues of Health Savings Accounts (HSA) in California. She found that AI would &ldquo;confidently spout nonsense,&rdquo; with different AIs and online articles providing contradictory information, creating a phenomenon of &ldquo;mutual contamination.&rdquo; In the end, she had to return to first principles and personally check the original tax code to confirm the correct information: in California, both HSA contributions and investment gains are subject to state tax, significantly reducing the tax benefits.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He completely agreed. He emphasized that current AI is still an &ldquo;amateur&rdquo; tool or &ldquo;toy&rdquo; and cannot be used for serious professional fields like tax or law. He himself found that AI makes basic numerical errors when creating videos. He reiterated that he does not recommend using HSAs and added a clarification that he might have previously confused HSAs with 529 plans. The beneficiary for withdrawals from a 529 account is a designated beneficiary (like a child), whereas the HSA holder can use the funds themselves.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is a natural gift&hellip; you have the right to be wealthy, and you need to be informed of this.
&ndash; James
Background: James explained his original intention for starting the channel was that many people don&rsquo;t know they are inherently entitled to become wealthy through correct investing.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The more advanced technology and AI become&hellip; people who use AI don&rsquo;t become more idle but busier, because there are more and more things you can do.
&ndash; James
Background: When discussing the impact of AI, James pointed out that AI is a tool that expands the boundaries of our capabilities, resulting in us being able to do, and wanting to do, more things, rather than making us idle.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A person doesn&rsquo;t know what it is to be human until they are without a job. That is what you call a &rsquo;life.'
&ndash; James
Background: In explaining his life philosophy, James criticized the idea of &ldquo;living to work,&rdquo; believing that only by breaking free from the shackles of work can one truly experience and understand the meaning of life.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Survival is more important than making money.
&ndash; James
Background: When commenting on Ling&rsquo;s case study about risk perception, James emphasized that survival is the first principle of investing. Managing risk and keeping sufficient cash is far more important than chasing short-term high returns.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s understanding of risk can be completely different&hellip; You must first figure out what you consider to be risk before you allocate your assets.
&ndash; Ling
Background: Ling shared her experience helping a novice investor friend and discovered a huge gap between the friend&rsquo;s stated risk tolerance and her actual psychological bottom line, leading to this conclusion.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AI will confidently spout nonsense&hellip; In the world today, there is some information&hellip; that is prone to this kind of mutual contamination.
&ndash; Julia
Background: Julia shared her pitfalls when using AI to research complex tax issues, finding that AI and incorrect online information form a vicious cycle, mutually citing and amplifying errors.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Invest only in index funds, buy whenever you have money and never sell, buy with your eyes closed&hellip; Do your asset allocation&hellip; live off loans from stock pledging, and never repay them.
&ndash; James
Background: When summarizing the seventh and highest level of investment operations, James used this phrase to encapsulate the essence of the strategy for achieving ultimate financial freedom.</p></blockquote>

<p>This session was a systematic and in-depth review of investment philosophy and life-wealth concepts. Through a clear, three-tiered &ldquo;seven-level ladder&rdquo; model, James constructed a complete growth blueprint for listeners, from investment novice to wealthy magnate. The course not only taught &ldquo;what to do&rdquo; (invest in indexes, don&rsquo;t sell, use pledging wisely) but also profoundly explained &ldquo;why to do it&rdquo; (understand risk, ignore noise, believe in compounding) and the ultimate goal (achieve freedom in life, not be enslaved by work). The students&rsquo; sharing and questions—from practical operations to macroeconomics and the critical use of AI tools—greatly enriched the breadth and depth of the discussion, once again confirming that investment success ultimately stems from continuous learning, deep self-awareness, and a firm philosophical belief.</p>

      <title>00535 The First Step in Financial Management is Managing Cash Flow; Without Understanding Cash Flow, You&#39;re Investing Like a Blind Man Touching an Elephant!</title>

      <description>This session focuses on the core principle of asset allocation, which is that your asset allocation strategy is independent of whether you obtain living expenses by selling assets or through collateralized loans. Teacher James emphasizes that the first step in financial management is to clarify cash flow, ensuring a positive free cash flow is key to avoiding bankruptcy. Meanwhile, students shared their investment journeys, including a deep understanding of the &amp;#39;compounding inflection point&amp;#39; and an optimistic outlook on the future development of AI technology. Teacher James also demonstrated live how to use the NotebookLM tool to quickly convert video content into multilingual text and presentations, empowering everyone to spread investment philosophies.</description>

<p>This session&rsquo;s core theme revolves around <strong>Asset Allocation and Cash Flow Management</strong>. Teacher James clearly stated that an investor&rsquo;s asset allocation strategy (e.g., 70% stocks, 30% cash) is an independent decision that should not change based on whether you choose to &ldquo;sell assets&rdquo; or &ldquo;take out a collateralized loan&rdquo; for living expenses. Furthermore, the teacher elaborated that &ldquo;managing cash flow&rdquo; is the cornerstone of financial management. For both individuals and businesses, having a consistently positive &ldquo;free cash flow&rdquo; is the fundamental guarantee of financial health and survival. Ignoring cash flow and blindly leveraging is the root cause of financial crises.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Viewpoint</strong>: Asset allocation and whether you live by selling stocks or taking out a pledged loan are not directly related.</li>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>: Regardless of whether you plan to cover living expenses by selling some assets (like money market funds) or by borrowing against your stocks, your asset allocation ratio (e.g., 70% QQQ, 30% cash) should remain the same. The purpose of allocation is to allow assets to exist and grow stably in the long term, while the method of withdrawing cash flow is merely a tactical choice that should not affect the strategic allocation.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sign of a Beginner</strong>: If you still worry about whether the market will fall in the future, it means you haven&rsquo;t grasped the basics of investing. The correct investment philosophy is to ignore market fluctuations and hold for the long term.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Method</strong>: Learning without watching the videos is like a &ldquo;blind man touching an elephant&rdquo;—extremely risky. Learning and thinking are the start of investing. You should actively ask questions when you encounter problems, but ultimately, you need to internalize the understanding yourself.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow is the Lifeline</strong>: The first step in financial management is &ldquo;managing cash flow.&rdquo; Many companies go bankrupt not because of bad business, but because their cash flow breaks (they can&rsquo;t make payments by 3:30 PM). The same principle applies to personal investing.</li>
<li><strong>Free Cash Flow</strong>: Refers to the stable monthly cash inflow, after deducting all expenses (living costs, loans, entertainment, etc.), that can be freely used.</li>
<li><strong>Standard for Financial Health</strong>: A healthy financial situation means <strong>free cash flow must be positive</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Cautionary Cases</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Individual Investor</strong>: Someone took out personal loans and mortgages, thinking stocks would rise and they could use the profits to repay the loans. However, the market crashed right after they bought in, the stock value shrank, and they were forced to sell at a low point, leading to bankruptcy.</li>
<li><strong>Real Estate Investor</strong>: They rushed to buy pre-sale homes, only to find out when it was time for handover or to pay the principal and interest that their cash flow couldn&rsquo;t support it. What seemed like a &ldquo;buy-and-profit&rdquo; opportunity turned into a &ldquo;buy-and-lose&rdquo; situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: No matter when or under what circumstances, you must first clearly calculate your cash flow to ensure it is healthy and stable.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple Strategy</strong>: Investing is about following a plan step-by-step and letting your assets navigate their own growth.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth is a Birthright</strong>: By investing in index funds (like the Nasdaq 100), everyone, regardless of background, income, or location, can become wealthy. If you are not yet wealthy, it means your method is wrong.</li>
<li><strong>Happiness is the Goal</strong>: Wealth is not the ultimate goal; a happy life is. Investing should be time-saving and effortless, giving us time to focus on doing things that bring us joy.</li>
<li><strong>Index vs. Individual Stocks</strong>: Index funds are a &ldquo;lazy person&rsquo;s investment method&rdquo; where you can make money just by lying down. Individual stock investing is more hectic, with more worries, and an individual stock can drop 80% at any time, whereas the probability of an index fund experiencing a similar drop is extremely low.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: He internalized his nearly four-year investment journey into six stages, with the core being the emergence of the &ldquo;compounding inflection point.&rdquo;
<ol>
<li><strong>Selection and Allocation</strong>: Choose long-term growth assets like QQQ and establish a secure allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Use of Leverage</strong>: View leverage as a tool to reach the compounding inflection point sooner, not as a risk.</li>
<li><strong>Manage Cash Flow</strong>: Ensure you can afford to borrow and repay, so that compounding is not interrupted.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Doubling Period</strong>: This is a phase of quantitative accumulation. Enduring it will lead to an explosion. Market noise is irrelevant to me because, with a high rate of return, assets double quickly (e.g., at 25% annualized, they double in three years).</li>
<li><strong>Compounding Inflection Point</strong>: When your <strong>annual investment return equals or exceeds your cumulative principal invested</strong>, compounding begins to dominate asset growth. This is the &ldquo;second starting line&rdquo; of investing.</li>
<li><strong>Let the Snowball Roll Itself</strong>: When the asset size is large enough, time itself will accelerate the snowball&rsquo;s roll, and operations become unimportant.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: He highly praised YW&rsquo;s sharing and internalization. This inflection point where &ldquo;the return on money exceeds the return on labor&rdquo; is very important. The teacher gave a specific definition: when your <strong>annualized asset return (about 10% of assets) is greater than or equal to your annual salary</strong>, that is the inflection point of financial freedom. He also thanked YW for his quiet contributions as a volunteer.</li>

<li>Sharing 1:
<ol>
<li>The OCP Global Summit will be held in the U.S. next week, with major tech giants participating. This once again confirms the trend of continuous growth in U.S. technology, and we should be optimistic about the future.</li>
<li>The development of AI has exceeded imagination, no longer limited to software applications but starting to permeate infrastructure like wireless networks. For example, NVIDIA&rsquo;s technology has entered wireless base stations, using AI to allocate and optimize network signals (like 6G) for more efficient and seamless connections. In the future, we will live in a world empowered by AI without even feeling its presence.</li>
<li>Although NVIDIA is the leader, other competitors are constantly emerging, innovating to address its weaknesses (like the memory wall). This competition will drive the entire AI industry to develop more vigorously.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The teacher was amazed by the idea of &ldquo;AI entering life through microwaves&rdquo; and asked for more details. Damon explained that AI will act as a general commander, coordinating all data packets in the network to solve synchronization and efficiency problems, avoiding resource waste, and thus significantly improving network performance. The teacher summarized it as being like a conductor of a symphony orchestra, making all independent nodes work together. In the future, military, transportation, and other fields will be coordinated by AI, leading to a massive increase in efficiency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 1: Regarding the tax rate Vivian mentioned, does it refer to the federal tax or does it include state tax?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: It mainly refers to the federal tax rates (e.g., 22%, 24%). State tax, of course, must be paid, but since state tax is unavoidable regardless of when you convert, the federal tax brackets are the primary basis for decision-making.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: If an investor does not have a green card and cannot get a portfolio line of credit (PLOC), how should they invest?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The principle of asset allocation remains unchanged. If you cannot borrow against your portfolio, it means living expenses must be covered by your income, and the remaining funds are used for investment. The investment strategy (like allocation ratio) is not related to whether you can get a PLOC. You should make the best possible use of allowed retirement accounts, such as a Roth IRA.</li>

On the other hand, his friend easily gave 100 NTD to a foreigner playing guitar on the street. This contrast deeply moved him.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: His friend spent 25,000 NTD on an investment course to learn how to read the three major financial statements, EPS, ROE, etc., with the goal of beating QQQ. Haoqing believes this is basic knowledge and that it&rsquo;s better to just hold the index than to spend time trading. He questioned why the teacher of the course wouldn&rsquo;t just borrow money to invest himself if the method was so effective, instead of earning a 25,000 NTD tuition fee.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: He deeply empathized with the first story and said he would encourage his family to be more generous to hardworking small vendors. For the second story, the teacher completely agreed with Haoqing&rsquo;s view, pointing out that <strong>investment success depends not on knowledge, but on human nature and mentality</strong>. More knowledge might lead to more frequent trading, which could in turn lead to faster failure. He used the bankruptcy of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), founded by Nobel laureates, as an example to prove that only by overcoming human nature and holding for the long term can most people become wealthy.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: He shared the original intention behind his animated series &ldquo;Chen Feng Tells Stories - The Hamster&rsquo;s Investment Adventure.&rdquo; He hopes to convey financial management concepts to a wider age range (from 10 years old to adults) through fairy tales and Aesop&rsquo;s fables. For example, he uses the story of &ldquo;one tree versus a forest&rdquo; to explain the difference in risk diversification between investing in a single stock (like TSMC) and an index (like 00662), making complex investment concepts easy to understand.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: The teacher highly commended Chenfeng&rsquo;s efforts and took the opportunity to encourage everyone to listen and watch more, as even familiar content can serve as &ldquo;hypnotherapy&rdquo; and reinforce confidence. Then, the teacher <strong>demonstrated live how to use Google&rsquo;s NotebookLM tool</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Copy YouTube Link</strong>: Copy the link of any YouTube video (including CLEC&rsquo;s videos).</li>
<li><strong>Paste into NotebookLM</strong>: Create a new note in NotebookLM, choose to upload from a link, and paste the YouTube link.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Transcription and Translation</strong>: The AI will automatically transcribe the video&rsquo;s audio into text and can, based on settings, translate it into <strong>any language</strong> (like English, Japanese, Portuguese, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Generate Various Content Formats</strong>: You can instruct the AI to organize the text into various formats such as a <strong>video presentation, study guide, blog post, podcast dialogue script</strong>, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Empower Content Creation</strong>: The teacher encouraged everyone to use this tool to translate his Chinese video content into their own country&rsquo;s language, create their own YouTube channels or content platforms, and explicitly stated that <strong>he authorizes everyone to use his content without any copyright issues</strong>, in order to help more people in different language regions.</li>

<li>Sharing: After discovering the channel, she observed for 6 months before starting to invest. Although she bought at a high point, she held on, and now her annual investment return far exceeds her earned income. Her only regret is that when she shared it with friends and family, they were all indifferent. She also shared her past failure of selling Tesla based on news reports, emphasizing not to watch financial news.</li>
<li>Question: Regarding her husband&rsquo;s (age 53) Traditional IRA of about $700,000, how should it be converted to a Roth IRA? She wants to know if she should convert it quickly under the 24% tax bracket. She is worried they won&rsquo;t be able to finish converting it after retirement.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: He advised her to <strong>convert it immediately, as soon as possible, and aggressively</strong>. First, stop contributing to the Traditional account. Second, using a 20-year time horizon and assuming an 8% annualized return, they would need to convert about $66,000 per year. If they wait until after retirement to convert, the amount in the account will be much larger, and the annual conversion amount will also be larger, potentially pushing them into a higher tax bracket, which would be counterproductive. The conclusion is, the sooner you convert, the better.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is a birthright&hellip; we focus on doing things that bring joy. Happiness is a human right.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: The teacher was explaining that through simple index investing, everyone can achieve financial freedom, thus shifting life&rsquo;s focus from making money to pursuing happiness, because happiness is everyone&rsquo;s inherent right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The compounding inflection point is the second starting line of investing. When your annual return equals your cumulative principal invested, compounding begins to dominate everything&hellip; compounding starts to explode and dominate asset growth.
&ndash; YW</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Student YW, summarizing his investment journey, proposed the concept of the &ldquo;compounding inflection point&rdquo; to vividly describe the explosive stage when investment returns themselves become the primary driver of growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asset allocation actually has no direct relationship with whether you use a pledged loan&hellip; Your asset allocation doesn&rsquo;t change whether you live off a pledged loan or by selling from your money market fund.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: The teacher was clarifying a common misconception, emphasizing the strategic importance of asset allocation, which is independent of the tactical choice of how to withdraw living expenses from one&rsquo;s assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quietly, AI has already permeated every corner of our lives, so you won&rsquo;t even feel what AI is&hellip; you are living in a world of AI.
&ndash; Damon</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Student Damon, sharing his observations on the development of AI technology, described a future where AI will be seamlessly integrated into infrastructure, greatly improving life&rsquo;s efficiency, while people might not even be aware of its presence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To truly succeed in investing, it&rsquo;s not about the knowledge itself&hellip; more knowledge might make you go bankrupt faster, because you become more active.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When commenting on a student&rsquo;s friend who took an expensive &ldquo;technical analysis&rdquo; course, the teacher pointedly remarked that the key to investment success lies in mentality and discipline (long-term holding), not complex financial knowledge. Too much knowledge can, in fact, tempt one to trade frequently, leading to failure.</p>

<p>This gathering once again reinforced the core investment philosophy of CLEC. Starting from the two fundamental points of &ldquo;Asset Allocation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cash Flow Management,&rdquo; Teacher James clearly analyzed the underlying logic of successful investing: <strong>Strategically, adhere to the correct asset allocation and hold for the long term, unmoved by market volatility; tactically, you must clarify and ensure a healthy cash flow, which is the foundation for withstanding all risks.</strong> The students&rsquo; sharings were also highly inspiring. YW&rsquo;s &ldquo;compounding inflection point&rdquo; provided a clear milestone for an investor&rsquo;s growth path, while Damon&rsquo;s insights into AI technology filled us with confidence for the future. It is particularly noteworthy that Teacher James provided a live tutorial on using an AI tool (NotebookLM) for content creation and dissemination. This not only provided everyone with a powerful tool but also embodied the open spirit of selflessly sharing investment philosophy with the entire world.</p>

      <description>In this session, Teacher James elaborates on the core strategies of asset allocation and withdrawal rates for those who are retired or nearing retirement, emphasizing that &amp;#39;survival&amp;#39; is more important than chasing high returns. The content covers portfolio construction with different cash ratios (30%, 40%, 50%), maximum Beta value limits, and corresponding safe withdrawal rates. It also delves into topics like stock pledging, investment mindset, and the outlook for the AI era. The student sharing segment is rich with content, ranging from the joy of financial growth through practice to discussions on specific financial decisions (like buying a car or investing with a loan).</description>

<p>The core theme of this session is <strong>constructing a robust asset allocation strategy for retired or near-retired individuals with &lsquo;survival&rsquo; as the primary goal</strong>. The central idea is that financial planning in retirement should prioritize the stability and longevity of cash flow over maximizing investment returns. Teacher James explains in detail how to set the portfolio&rsquo;s risk exposure (Beta value) based on different levels of cash reserves (30%, 40%, 50%) and, accordingly, determine a safe annual withdrawal rate. The aim is to ensure one can weather even extreme market conditions, such as a 15-year-long bear market.</p>

<li><strong>Beware of Scams</strong>: Recent online scams remain rampant, such as videos using AI to imitate the voices of figures like Jensen Huang, luring users into groups with offers of free books or ChatGPT tutorials for fraudulent purposes.

Important institutions like the government and banks typically communicate via mail rather than phone calls.</li>
<li><strong>Identifying Fake Accounts</strong>: After recommending &ldquo;阿良正传的人生&rdquo; (A-Liang&rsquo;s True Story of Life) last week, some students mistakenly followed a fake Facebook account set up by scammers.

<p>Teacher James proposed three cash-based asset allocation models for retirees with different financial situations and risk tolerances:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>30% Cash Allocation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highest Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 1.0)</strong>: The remaining 70% of assets can be allocated as 40% in an index fund (like QQQ) and 30% in a leveraged fund (like TQQQ).</li>
<li><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate</strong>: With this allocation, a maximum of <strong>2%</strong> of total assets can be withdrawn annually for living expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.7)</strong>: If the portfolio consists of 70% in an index fund with no leverage, the withdrawal rate can be increased to <strong>3%</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: The higher the asset volatility, the lower the withdrawal rate must be to prevent excessive asset depletion during a market downturn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>40% Cash Allocation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.9)</strong>: The remaining 60% of assets can be allocated with a maximum of 30% in an index fund and 30% in a leveraged fund.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate</strong>: With this allocation, a maximum of <strong>3%</strong> can be withdrawn annually.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.6)</strong>: If the portfolio is 40% index and 20% leveraged, the withdrawal rate can be increased to <strong>4%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>50% Cash Allocation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.7)</strong>: The remaining 50% of assets can be allocated with a maximum of 30% in an index fund and 20% in a leveraged fund.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate</strong>: With this allocation, <strong>4%</strong> can be withdrawn annually.</li>
<li><strong>No-Leverage Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.5)</strong>: If the allocation is 50% cash and 50% index fund, the withdrawal rate can be increased to <strong>5%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ultimate Goal: 15 Years of Cash Reserves</strong>
<ul>
<li>The most ideal state is to hold enough cash at a market high to cover living expenses for the next 15 years. Considering that cash itself earns interest (e.g., 3.5%), one might only need to prepare 12-13 years&rsquo; worth of principal to last for 15 years.</li>
<li>If this cannot be achieved initially, cash can be gradually accumulated through rebalancing when the market goes up until the 15-year goal is met or exceeded.</li>
<li>Only when cash reserves exceed 15 years of living expenses can the surplus be used to buy the dip during a market downturn, ensuring that &ldquo;survival&rdquo; remains the top priority.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investing is Learned, Not Taught</strong>: James quotes the concept of &ldquo;The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao,&rdquo; emphasizing that investment philosophy must be personally contemplated, understood, and practiced to be truly internalized. Like riding a bicycle, no amount of reading can replace getting on the bike and trying. He encourages everyone to use their hands and minds to explore and comprehend for themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Rethinking Stock Pledging</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Evolution of Concept</strong>: In the past, to avoid sacrificing returns by holding cash (used for pledging), it was recommended to pair it with leveraged funds. Now, the emphasis is more on &ldquo;stability&rdquo; and &ldquo;survival.&rdquo; Therefore, even without chasing the highest returns, a no-leverage portfolio of 50% cash and 50% index fund can still be used for a pledged-asset line of credit.</li>
<li><strong>Pledging Risk Warning</strong>: The teacher used an example to explain why even a seemingly low borrowing ratio (e.g., 10%) could lead to bankruptcy. Suppose you borrow $100,000 against $1 million in assets. During a prolonged bear market of 10 years (like 2000-2009, when the market fell 85%), the $100,000 loan plus interest could grow to $160,000, while your assets might shrink to just $150,000, at which point you would be insolvent. This highlights the importance of holding sufficient cash (e.g., 30%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow is the Lifeline</strong>: An anecdote about an individual with over 100 million TWD in assets who fell into a cash flow crisis after buying a 75 million TWD mansion serves as a warning that regardless of asset size, a lack of cash flow management can lead to bankruptcy risk.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: She started listening to the teacher&rsquo;s classes in April 2021. Although she&rsquo;s a slow learner, she has saved $100,000 in the past 20 months despite a modest salary, which makes her very surprised and happy. She has already reduced her portfolio&rsquo;s Beta from 1.3 to around 1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Her car is in poor condition. Should she spend $1,000 to fix it and drive for a few more years, or buy a Tesla to improve her quality of life? Although she&rsquo;s tempted, she feels she is still in the early stages of wealth accumulation.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: He advises spending the $1,000 to fix the car. Since her total assets are not yet substantial, buying a fifty or sixty-thousand-dollar car would be too high a percentage of her total assets. At this stage, she should continue to invest her funds. The teacher suggests she cleverly use credit cards, such as an Apple Card or American Express with 2%-3% cash back, and invest all the rewards into TQQQ, thereby &ldquo;getting richer as you spend.&rdquo; At the same time, he shared a personal regret. Due to his frugality, when he took his mother to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, she hesitated to take more dishes to be considerate of him, a memory that he later deeply regretted. Therefore, while buying a car is not recommended, one should not be overly frugal on crucial matters like showing filial piety to parents.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: After listening to a Buddhist dharma talk, she associated Teacher James&rsquo;s teachings with helping people &ldquo;escape the cycle of poverty,&rdquo; which filled her with a &ldquo;mind of reverence.&rdquo; She shared her recent action: she resolutely terminated a losing insurance policy, got back $24,000, and immediately invested it using the teacher&rsquo;s method. She believes that although it&rsquo;s a short-term loss, it&rsquo;s more important to cut losses in time and get on the right &ldquo;elevator,&rdquo; as she can earn it back in the coming years. She also began to ponder the deeper meaning of the teacher&rsquo;s emphasis on &ldquo;reserving 15 years of cash,&rdquo; understanding it&rsquo;s to ensure that one can both live without worry and navigate through a long bear market via rebalancing.</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: He explained the &ldquo;15 years of cash&rdquo; concept in detail. It is mainly for retired individuals with no source of income. The calculation is: annual expenses minus fixed income (like social security), then multiply the amount you need to cover by 15. For example, if you need to provide $50,000 yourself annually, you need to prepare $750,000 in cash. This standard is based on the historical experience of 2000-2015, where the market might have taken 15 years to return to its high. For those still working, they can dynamically replenish cash with their monthly salary and don&rsquo;t need to strictly sell stocks for rebalancing.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is a &ldquo;veteran student&rdquo; who has been following the teacher since 2011. He believes that new students today are very fortunate because the teacher&rsquo;s current investment strategy (indexing, long-term holding, automation) has evolved to its &ldquo;most perfect moment.&rdquo; He recalled that in the early years, the teacher&rsquo;s methods included individual stock picking and active trading. While it was possible to avoid major crashes, it was difficult for ordinary people to follow, and the after-tax returns were not ideal. Many old students missed out on the later, more optimized strategies because they didn&rsquo;t continue learning. He himself, based on the teacher&rsquo;s latest retirement calculation method in late 2023, found that he had enough to retire. He officially retired in January 2024 and now lives a wonderful life, with his investment income even exceeding his previous salary.</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: He thanked Dr. An for his sharing. He compared his early investment teaching to an &ldquo;expeditionary force,&rdquo; with heavy casualties and few who could keep up. Now, because online teaching doesn&rsquo;t allow for real-time command of tens of thousands of students, the strategy had to evolve into a &ldquo;space force&rdquo;—a fully automated model with no manual intervention. The pandemic accelerated this transformation. He praised Dr. An for not only keeping up but also implementing advanced operations like stock pledging and Roth conversions.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: With this conflicting mindset of &ldquo;wanting to accelerate&rdquo; yet knowing &ldquo;safety comes first,&rdquo; how should he adjust his asset allocation and mentality?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Since he is nearly 10 years away from retirement, he can absolutely adopt a more aggressive strategy. He can maintain a Beta of 1.0 and &ldquo;not rebalance&rdquo; for the next few years, letting his profits run. This might naturally increase his Beta to 1.3 or even 1.5. When he is about 5 years from retirement, he can start &ldquo;hitting the brakes&rdquo; by gradually increasing his cash position and reducing risk.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: At the age of 30-something, how can one better &ldquo;exchange money for spiritual energy&rdquo;?

<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The core of spiritual energy is &ldquo;vision&rdquo; and &ldquo;capacity of mind.&rdquo; You should practice a mindset: imagine you suddenly have 20 billion. If your lifestyle and mentality remain unchanged, then your spiritual energy is strong enough. True financial freedom is when &ldquo;money&rdquo; disappears from your life. It becomes like air, natural. When you consume, you no longer consider the price, only the value and experience.

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is a new student who just found the channel two weeks ago and lost sleep for a few days due to the sheer volume of information. His previous belief was to hold VT and 0050 long-term and sell assets to live on in retirement. He only understood the groundbreaking concept of &ldquo;stock pledging&rdquo; after encountering the teacher.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>:
<ol>
<li>If, after retiring and starting to withdraw via pledging for 3 years, his cash reserves reach the 15-year level, does he need to prepare 18 years of cash to be safe, considering the 3 years of living expenses already borrowed?</li>
<li>When the teacher retired at 42, did he already have the concept of living off a pledged-asset line of credit? What was the inspiration for this idea?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>No, it&rsquo;s not necessary. Because after a few years of market growth, your total asset size will be much larger than at the beginning. The growth in assets will be more than enough to cover the borrowed portion, making your safety cushion even thicker.</li>
<li>It was an evolutionary process. He didn&rsquo;t know about it when he retired; he discovered it later. In 2018, he needed money but didn&rsquo;t want to sell stocks and pay high taxes, so he proactively emailed his brokerage to ask if he could borrow against his stocks. The brokerage immediately set up a pledged-asset loan for him. He pointed out that this is a &ldquo;secret&rdquo; of the financial industry because regulations restrict brokerages from proactively marketing such banking services to clients unless the client asks first.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>For retirement, what matters is cash flow, not rate of return. Return is secondary; survival is the most important thing.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This viewpoint was a common thread throughout the session and is the cornerstone of this asset allocation strategy, reminding retirees to place financial security above return growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. &hellip; The true Tao is the one you comprehend for yourself. Everything spoken is just the surface, the written words of a martial arts manual.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher emphasizes the importance of independent thinking and personal practice in investing. Knowledge must be internalized to become true wisdom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A peanut for your parents while they&rsquo;re alive is worth more than a whole pig on the altar after they&rsquo;re gone. (Taiwanese proverb)
&ndash; Teacher James (Quoted by Jenny during her sharing)</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher uses this vivid metaphor to stress that filial piety and care should be expressed while loved ones are still alive; their value far exceeds lavish memorials after they have passed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don&rsquo;t reduce volatility by changing your investment vehicle; you reduce volatility by holding cash. Low long-term return is the real risk.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>A concise point made by the teacher when answering his daughter&rsquo;s question, pointing out that the correct way to handle market volatility is to adjust the cash ratio, not to sacrifice long-term returns by choosing a less volatile asset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to first tell yourself that he is right, and I am wrong. &hellip; Why would someone who is wrong be so loud? This will make you reflect.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher&rsquo;s method for practicing patience, shared when answering how to maintain it. By first acknowledging the other person&rsquo;s validity, one can effectively de-escalate one&rsquo;s own emotions and achieve more peaceful communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never pay back borrowed money. This is very important. If you intend to pay back the money from a pledged-asset line, you shouldn&rsquo;t have borrowed it in the first place.
&ndash; Benson &amp; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Benson&rsquo;s sharing and the teacher&rsquo;s confirmation highlight the core essence of stock pledging: the borrowed money is a tool for living expenses or reinvestment. The goal is to ensure the cash-flow-generating asset is never depleted, thus &ldquo;repaying the principal&rdquo; is an incorrect operation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When investing doesn&rsquo;t exist, the market doesn&rsquo;t exist, and money doesn&rsquo;t exist, that&rsquo;s when your spiritual energy is at its peak.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher describes the highest state of financial freedom. When wealth is so abundant that one no longer needs to think or worry about money itself, one can attain true spiritual freedom.</p>

<p>This session was an extremely profound and practical lesson on retirement financial planning. Teacher James has evolved from his previous focus on &ldquo;the highest return under safe conditions&rdquo; to a more conservative strategy centered on &ldquo;absolute safety,&rdquo; providing a clear and actionable guide to asset allocation and withdrawal rates for those approaching or in retirement. Through the detailed breakdown of the 30%, 40%, and 50% cash allocation models, individuals in different financial situations can find a suitable &ldquo;survival&rdquo; plan. The numerous student sharings in the Q&amp;A session, from the &ldquo;then and now&rdquo; comparisons of veteran students to the &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moments and practical applications of new students, vividly demonstrated how this investment philosophy can change the financial destinies and life outlooks of different people. The entire session was not just a transmission of investment techniques but a deep exchange on views about wealth, risk, and life wisdom.</p>

      <title>00533 Survival is More Important Than Rate of Return: First Set Your Cash Ratio, Then Choose Your Beta, and Your Investment Will Be Stable</title>

      <description>In this session, Teacher James elaborates on the core idea of flexible asset allocation, emphasizing that the cash ratio determines the Beta range and annual withdrawal rate of an investment portfolio. Investors should dynamically adjust this based on their own circumstances (e.g., retirement status, capital size). The core principle is to &amp;#39;survive&amp;#39; rather than to chase the highest returns. The Q&amp;amp;A session delves into diverse topics such as youth investment, market panic, relationships, children&amp;#39;s education, personal destiny, and even international politics, showcasing the deep thinking of community members and the application of investment philosophy to life.</description>

<p>The core theme of this session is <strong>the flexibility of asset allocation and the survival rule for long-term investment</strong>. Teacher James emphasizes that asset allocation is not about rigid, unchanging numbers but should be dynamically adjusted based on an individual&rsquo;s cash needs, capital size, and risk tolerance. The central idea is that investors should first determine their cash holding ratio, which will dictate the risk exposure (Beta value) range of their portfolio and their sustainable annual withdrawal rate. For long-term investors, the most important goal is to &ldquo;survive,&rdquo; ensuring they can endure the long-term fluctuations of the market, rather than blindly pursuing the highest rate of return.</p>

<p>Teacher James focused on explaining two pages from the handout on asset allocation, emphasizing their flexibility and core principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Cash Ratio Determines Everything</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your asset allocation should first be determined by your <strong>cash ratio</strong>, which will set the Beta value range of your portfolio and the percentage of your annual withdrawable amount.</li>
<li><strong>Basic Principle</strong>: The position in leveraged funds should not be higher than your cash position, nor should it be higher than your position in the underlying ETF (QQQ). For example, a 433 allocation (40% QQQ, 30% leveraged, 30% cash) is considered quite aggressive.</li>
<li><strong>Examples of Allocations and Withdrawal Rates for Different Cash Ratios</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>30% Cash</strong>: Beta range between 0.7 and 1.0.
<ul>
<li>With a Beta of 1.0 (e.g., 433 allocation), the maximum annual withdrawal is <strong>2%</strong>.</li>
<li>With a Beta of 0.7 (e.g., 703 allocation), the annual withdrawal can be <strong>3%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>40% Cash</strong>: Beta range between 0.6 and 0.9.
<ul>
<li>With a Beta of 0.9 (e.g., 334 allocation), the annual withdrawal can be <strong>3%</strong>.</li>
<li>With a Beta of 0.6 (e.g., 604 allocation), the annual withdrawal can be <strong>4%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>50% Cash</strong>: Beta range between 0.5 and 0.7.
<ul>
<li>With a Beta of 0.5-0.6 (e.g., 505 or 415 allocation), the annual withdrawal can be <strong>5%</strong>.</li>
<li>With a Beta of 0.7, the withdrawal rate should be reduced to <strong>4%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic Management of the &ldquo;15-Year&rdquo; Cash Reserve</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ideal State</strong>: Hold enough cash to cover 15 years of living expenses to safely navigate any market downturn and consolidation period, while waiting for the investment portion to double.</li>
<li><strong>Practical Application</strong>: If you don&rsquo;t have a 15-year cash reserve initially (e.g., only 10 years), you should adopt the following strategy:
<ul>
<li><strong>When the market rises</strong>: Convert profits from investments (especially leveraged funds) into cash to gradually build your cash reserve up to the 15-year level. Once the 15-year mark is reached, there&rsquo;s no need to add more.</li>
<li><strong>When the market falls</strong>: <strong>Absolutely do not</strong> invest your only 10 years (or less) of cash into the market. You cannot predict how long a bear market will last, and exhausting your cash too early will force you to sell stocks at a market low, leading to investment failure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Core Philosophy</strong>: The most important thing in long-term investing is <strong>to survive</strong>, not the rate of return. A slightly lower rate of return is acceptable; over a long period, your wealth will still be substantial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>Recognize the Nature of Financial Practitioners</strong>: There is a conflict of interest between bank wealth managers, insurance agents, and their clients. Their goal is to sell products, not to maximize the client&rsquo;s interests. Investors need to strengthen their own financial literacy and use the bank&rsquo;s services (like loans) rather than buying the financial products they push.</li>
<li><strong>Advice for the Elderly</strong>: Older friends (e.g., 70-80 years old) should spend more money to enjoy life rather than making asset growth their primary goal. With allocations like 505, 415, or even 316, the annual withdrawal rate can be increased to 5-6%.</li>
<li><strong>Be Greedy When Others Are Fearful</strong>: Looking back at the market bottom in October 2022 (QQQ around $260, lowest at $254), there was extreme panic in the market, but it proved to be an excellent buying point. Investors need to train themselves to remain greedy when others are fearful.</li>
<li><strong>Ignite a Capitalist Awakening</strong>: Teacher James believes that the essence of capitalism is the exploitation of labor and emerging nations by capitalists and developed countries through the system. We must learn their &ldquo;strong ships and powerful cannons&rdquo; of financial operations to change the destiny of ourselves, our families, and even our nation.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: My son is a senior in college and invests NT$1,500 monthly into 00670L (a 2x leveraged QQQ ETF). He just started two months ago. I&rsquo;m wondering if he needs to rebalance now, given the small amount, or at what amount should he start?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: With a small initial amount, just keep investing. When the market value of 00670L accumulates to about NT$1 million, he can start asset allocation, for instance, by shifting to a 433 (40% underlying, 30% leveraged, 30% cash) portfolio. As his salary increases, he can continue to invest and perform a smart rebalancing once a year at year-end. Additionally, the teacher encouraged young people, noting that they live in an era of rapid technological development where investment returns are higher than in the past. As long as they know how to invest, their future will be brighter.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Speaking for the first time, 30 years old, working in the Southern Taiwan Science Park. He shared his journey from investing in individual stocks, to the 0050 ETF, to discovering leveraged ETFs and adopting the teacher&rsquo;s 433 allocation. He fully agrees with the teacher&rsquo;s entire system (asset allocation, smart rebalancing, stock pledge) and aims to retire at 40 with NT$30 million. He quoted the ancient text <em>Discourses on Salt and Iron</em>: &ldquo;Wealth lies in strategy, not in physical labor; profit lies in market conditions, not in diligent farming,&rdquo; to affirm the importance of financial knowledge. He sees the teacher as his &ldquo;rich dad&rdquo; and is very grateful.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: He shared that he might be fated to be single (&ldquo;孤寡命&rdquo;) but still wants his parents to retire early. He was also curious and asked the teacher how he chose his spouse when he was young.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Encouragement to Speak</strong>: He encouraged everyone to practice public speaking, as logic and expression are powerful tools for changing the world.</li>
<li><strong>About Destiny</strong>: An astrological chart tells you your life&rsquo;s lessons and risks to be aware of, not a fixed outcome. A &ldquo;fate of solitude&rdquo; is a reminder to overcome this issue by making more friends and building good relationships, not by resigning to it.</li>
<li><strong>About Love</strong>: The core is to <strong>&ldquo;become someone worthy of being loved.&rdquo;</strong> Don&rsquo;t set conditions for your partner; improve yourself first to become that person. True love is unconditional giving (&ldquo;I do&rdquo;). Learn to listen to your partner and don&rsquo;t keep score. If you first become a person worthy of love, your partner will naturally love you.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He discussed Trump&rsquo;s proposed $100,000 application fee for H1B visas. He believes this reflects that America now needs the &ldquo;elite of the elite,&rdquo; as many basic jobs will be replaced by AI. However, he thinks that even if one cannot come to the US to work, it&rsquo;s fine. We can invest in QQQ/00662 and become the &ldquo;bosses&rdquo; of these American geniuses, which might be a better choice.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: First, he corrected the understanding of the policy, explaining that the $100,000 fee is mainly for direct overseas hires whom the company doesn&rsquo;t know, not for graduates who studied in the US. This actually benefits international students in the US. More importantly, he stressed the importance of philosophical thinking: before judging an opinion, first stand in the other person&rsquo;s shoes to understand why they say it, instead of immediately refuting it. Finally, he humorously taught him how to express love to his wife, starting with silently chanting it to himself as a form of self-hypnosis.</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Sharing</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Regarding the H1B news, he noticed that the Chinese-American community initially shared it frantically without understanding the facts. The subsequent clarification from the White House stated the policy mainly targets outsourcing companies. This validates the teacher&rsquo;s point that &ldquo;market information is garbage, ignore it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Learning financial literacy requires patience. <strong>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry.&rdquo;</strong> He observed that the pace of life in the US is slow and encouraged everyone to learn slowly, one step at a time.</li>
<li>Borrowing is a great tool, but it requires accumulated financial wisdom. When your capital is large enough, banks will chase after you to lend you money. At that point, you won&rsquo;t haggle over a 2.1% versus 2.5% interest rate, because your investment return will far exceed it.</li>
<li>He offered a brilliant analogy: <strong>&ldquo;Strive to become the &rsquo;eternal QQQ&rsquo; in your partner&rsquo;s words,&rdquo;</strong> someone they will hold for the long term and never sell.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Strongly agreed. &ldquo;Surviving is the most important thing, don&rsquo;t be in a hurry.&rdquo; He warned those who have suffered heavy losses in short-term trading or futures not to expect to quickly recover their losses using our method, as this is very dangerous. For those nearing retirement, he also advised against borrowing money to invest due to the high dual risks of repayment pressure and market volatility.</li>

<li>I&rsquo;m interested in Zi Wei Dou Shu (Chinese astrology). What do the stars &ldquo;Di Kong&rdquo; and &ldquo;Di Jie&rdquo; in the self-palace represent? And is &ldquo;synastry&rdquo; (comparing charts) for couples useful for determining fate?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Allocate the money after it arrives.</strong> Don&rsquo;t act in advance, as anything can happen in the process. There&rsquo;s no need to predict.</li>
<li><strong>About Astrological Charts</strong>: Don&rsquo;t worry too much about minor stars like Di Kong and Di Jie. The most critical thing to look at is which palace the &ldquo;Huà Jì&rdquo; (Transforming Envy/Doom) star is in. Huà Jì represents your life&rsquo;s lesson and weakness, something you need to work hard to overcome, not your destiny. For example, if Huà Jì is in the marriage palace, it&rsquo;s a reminder to put effort into managing your marital relationship. Looking at your partner&rsquo;s chart is not for &ldquo;synastry&rdquo; but to understand their weaknesses and challenges, thereby fostering more empathy.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He expressed gratitude to the teacher, feeling very lucky to live in the internet era, able to learn valuable financial concepts across geographical boundaries. He fully agrees that technology will continue to advance, which is a reason to be firm in investing in high-tech (QQQ).
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: He encouraged everyone to buy a Tesla and shared the logic of &ldquo;spending money makes you richer&rdquo;: by making purchases with a loan and investing the 3% cash back from a credit card, the compound growth of this small amount over 40 years will far exceed the interest cost of the original purchase. Therefore, the more you spend (provided you can afford it and know how to invest), the richer you become.</li>

<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Start with a disclaimer</strong>: Clearly state that you are not a professional advisor and they are responsible for their own risks.</li>
<li><strong>For friends and family</strong>: You must first ask yourself if you are willing to &ldquo;go to hell&rdquo; for them. That is, are you psychologically prepared for the possibility of the relationship breaking down? If you are, then do it; if not, don&rsquo;t give advice.</li>
<li><strong>A feasible method</strong>: You can suggest they start with a small amount of money they can afford to lose and explain the long-term nature of it. You could even verbally promise that if they still have a loss after ten years, you&rsquo;ll cover it.</li>
<li><strong>For those you can&rsquo;t communicate with</strong>: Just block them. Make them &ldquo;unheard, unseen, and non-existent&rdquo; in your world. Our energy is limited; we should help those who are worth helping.</li>

<p>This session began with a very specific and core technical investment question—&ldquo;how to flexibly manage asset allocation&rdquo;—for which Teacher James provided a clear framework based on the cash ratio, emphasizing the paramount principle of &ldquo;survival before growth&rdquo; in long-term investing. The subsequent Q&amp;A session was extremely rich, extending from a young person&rsquo;s first investment to marriage, parenting, life philosophy, destiny, and insights into macroeconomic and political issues. This fully demonstrated that the learning atmosphere of the CLEC community has transcended mere investment management, entering a higher level where investment philosophy is integrated into all aspects of life. The members&rsquo; sharing was sincere and profound, showcasing a positive, supportive, and mutually growing community.</p>

      <description>In this session, Teacher James delves into how investors can evolve from &amp;#39;lower animals&amp;#39; susceptible to market volatility into &amp;#39;higher animals&amp;#39; capable of navigating bull and bear markets. The core concept revolves around the belief in &amp;#39;buy, hold, never sell,&amp;#39; emphasizing the importance of asset allocation and risk management. Additionally, the session provides a detailed analysis of the proper use and specific parameters of asset activation tools like HELOCs, reverse mortgages, and securities-based loans. Drawing on the wisdom of &amp;#39;The Bible of Financial Management,&amp;#39; it explains the fundamental philosophy for achieving financial freedom.</description>

<p>The core theme of this session is the <strong>evolution of investors</strong>. Teacher James compares investors to biological organisms, proposing that they need to evolve from &ldquo;single-celled lower animals,&rdquo; easily eliminated by market fluctuations, into &ldquo;higher animals&rdquo; capable of withstanding any market environment. This evolution is achieved by learning the correct investment philosophy and risk management. The key to this transformation is a firm belief that the market will rise in the long term, adopting a &ldquo;buy, hold, never sell&rdquo; strategy, and establishing an asset allocation that can withstand extreme risks (such as a market drop of 80% lasting for 10 years).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Belief is Paramount</strong>: The market has no peak; it only goes higher. It won&rsquo;t hit a ceiling; it will only rise ceaselessly. Investors should ignore external analysis and short-term market turmoil because no analysis can beat the power of &ldquo;holding shares and doing nothing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>The Ultimate Strategy</strong>: The simplest strategy is the most effective—buy, hold, and never sell. As long as you do this, you will become wealthy.</li>
<li><strong>Future Outlook</strong>: QQQ is now near 600, will soon reach 1000, and in the future, we will see 6,000, and even 60,000. Human progress is limitless, and the market&rsquo;s growth has no ceiling.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extinction of Lower Animals</strong>: The vast majority of investors in the market are &ldquo;single-celled&rdquo; or &ldquo;lower animals.&rdquo; They have not been tempered by the harsh market environment and lack the ability to cope with extreme risks. Therefore, in every financial crisis (such as the 1996 Asian Financial Crisis, the 2000 Dot-com Bubble, and the 2008 Subprime Mortgage Crisis), these &ldquo;species&rdquo; are wiped out in batches.</li>
<li><strong>Survival Principles of Higher Animals</strong>: Becoming a &ldquo;higher animal&rdquo; means possessing an investment system that has been tested over the long term and is capable of evolving. The core lies in truly understanding risk and building an asset allocation that can withstand the worst-case scenario (a market drop of 80% lasting for 10 years).</li>
<li><strong>CLEC&rsquo;s Positioning</strong>: The philosophy and system of our channel are a &ldquo;higher animal&rdquo; system, tested and evolved over 40 years in the market. We directly elevate our students to the highest level of investing, allowing them to avoid the fate of &ldquo;slaughter&rdquo; and &ldquo;extinction&rdquo; at the bottom of the market. We are not engaging in a brutal &ldquo;Normandy Landing&rdquo; battle; instead, we are &ldquo;taking the elevator&rdquo; directly to the Mount Everest of wealth.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) vs. Reverse Mortgage</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>HELOC</strong>: Suitable for young people with stable jobs. It poses a risk for retirees without a steady income, as the bank may require principal and interest payments after a few years. If the market is down at that time, it will create immense cash flow pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Mortgage</strong>: More suitable for older individuals without a stable salary. It converts real estate into a steady monthly cash flow, significantly enhancing the security of retirement life. This money can be used for living expenses or reinvested, making it an effective way to activate property assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advantages and Red Lines of Securities-Based Lending (Pledging Stocks)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage</strong>: The process is convenient and can be done with a few clicks, without needing the bank&rsquo;s approval.</li>
<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: Strict risk control and asset allocation are mandatory. The amount you can borrow is linked to your cash ratio:
<ul>
<li><strong>30% Cash</strong>: Can use <strong>2%-3%</strong> of assets annually.</li>
<li><strong>40% Cash</strong>: Can use <strong>3%-4%</strong> of assets annually.</li>
<li><strong>50% Cash</strong>: Can use <strong>4%-5%</strong> of assets annually.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Serious Warning (for U.S. Investors)</strong>: In the United States, it is <strong>absolutely forbidden</strong> to reinvest money borrowed from a securities-based loan back into a securities account. This is a serious violation. If discovered, the lending privileges may be revoked, and immediate repayment may be demanded, leading to a financial catastrophe. Regulations in Taiwan permit reinvestment, but it is strictly prohibited in the U.S.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Principles for Using Credit Loans</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Short-term credit loans should be repaid with a stable salary to ensure healthy cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of the &ldquo;High Dividends Covering Loan Interest&rdquo; Trap</strong>: Many experts advocate taking out loans to buy high-dividend products. While the dividend yield (e.g., 7%) may seem higher than the loan interest rate (e.g., 3%), they ignore that repayment requires both &ldquo;principal and interest.&rdquo; The dividend alone cannot cover the monthly payment, which can easily lead to a cash flow crisis.</li>
<li><strong>Example of Flexible Use</strong>: For instance, if you need $100,000 to buy a car, you could apply for a credit loan of $800,000. Use $100,000 for the car payment and invest the remaining $700,000. Later, you can use a securities-based loan from your investment portfolio, borrowing 2% annually to help repay the car loan, thus achieving more efficient use of your assets.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Divide Between the Rich and the Poor</strong>: A key factor distinguishing the two is whether they have been taught the correct concepts of financial management. Wealth is a &ldquo;natural gift&rdquo; that everyone can possess.</li>
<li><strong>The Essence of Investing</strong>: Investing is not a field where more diligent research leads to better performance. The key is having the right direction and a deep understanding, after which it becomes &ldquo;autopilot.&rdquo; 99.99% of external information is not worth listening to.</li>
<li><strong>The Prerequisite for Wealth</strong>: You must invest your assets in high-return targets. This is why we choose QQQ, not SPY or VT, because the latter&rsquo;s returns will make you relatively &ldquo;poorer.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>CLEC&rsquo;s Mission</strong>: If the government wants to narrow the wealth gap, it should instill the correct financial management concepts in the public. This is precisely what CLEC is doing. We are committed to financial investment education as our social mission.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: I found at today&rsquo;s seminar that the biggest problem for most people is that they &ldquo;can&rsquo;t hold on.&rdquo; This might be due to being stuck by certain &ldquo;limiting beliefs.&rdquo; I suggest that when you are still a &ldquo;seedling,&rdquo; you should not discuss our philosophy with outsiders who don&rsquo;t understand it. They will only tell you to &ldquo;take profits&rdquo; or &ldquo;stop loss.&rdquo; Regardless of whether the market goes up or down, the external environment is not conducive to long-term holding. If you have questions, you should come back and ask the teacher or the &ldquo;higher animals&rdquo; in the community.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Absolutely correct. We are the &ldquo;higher animals&rdquo; of investing. Isn&rsquo;t it ridiculous for a higher animal to ask a lower animal for a prescription? It&rsquo;s like a Rolls-Royce owner asking a financial advisor who rides a motorcycle or takes the bus for financial advice. Your circle determines your cognition. If you have questions, you must come back and ask those who have already made big money in this market.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: I am very excited that my family (son, daughter-in-law) and I have all joined the CLEC family. I believe it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;treasure trove&rdquo;—the more people who join, the more treasure there is, rather than a cake that gets smaller as it&rsquo;s divided.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: I reviewed the videos where the teacher talked about &ldquo;risk management&rdquo; and &ldquo;the person hiding in the cave&rdquo; (session 00523). I think they are incredibly valuable and have listened to them many times. I&rsquo;ve realized that to become truly wealthy, one needs to experience several bear markets to achieve a state of inner calm.</li>
<li>Sharing 3: Regarding the teacher&rsquo;s comment that &ldquo;whether you leave 20% or 30% cash in the end is not important,&rdquo; my understanding is that it depends on the size of one&rsquo;s total assets. For someone with assets of 1 billion, leaving 5% cash might be enough to live on for 20 years.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your understanding of the cash ratio is correct. The core idea is to calculate how many years your remaining cash can support your lifestyle; we typically use 10-15 years as a benchmark. For example, with 30% cash, if you use 2% per year, it will last 15 years; if you use 3% per year, it will last 10 years. The teacher also praised Bruce&rsquo;s proactive learning attitude, believing he will definitely succeed.</li>

<li>Questions (Canadian Investor):
<ol>
<li>In my IBKR account, is it correct to directly buy HXQ (the Canadian version of QQQ) in Canadian dollars as my core fund?</li>
<li>For the cash portion, I want to buy a non-dividend-paying Money Market fund. I could only find HSAV to buy with Canadian dollars, but its price fluctuates, which I don&rsquo;t quite understand. Should I convert to USD and buy BOXX instead?</li>
<li>Someone reminded me that Canadians holding U.S. assets face estate tax issues. What are your thoughts on this?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>Buying HXQ with Canadian dollars is correct.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s recommended to convert most of your cash (e.g., 25% of total assets) to USD and buy BOXX, as it has a higher interest rate and is non-dividend-paying, which avoids tax complications. At the same time, keep a small portion (e.g., 5%) of Canadian dollar cash in a Canadian money market fund for emergencies.</li>
<li>Estate tax is a valid concern, but it can be effectively managed by opening a &ldquo;Joint Account.&rdquo; Since you have already opened a joint account with your husband, you don&rsquo;t need to worry too much about this issue. For leveraged funds, Canada&rsquo;s QQU and TQQQ.TO are also usable options.</li>

<li>Sharing: I&rsquo;m 34 years old. After my assets reached 10 million TWD last year, I went all-in on 00662. I&rsquo;ve been through two downturns but my conviction is stronger, and I haven&rsquo;t sold a single share. He pointed out that many people in Taiwan are superstitious about 0050, but in reality, nearly 60% of 0050 is TSMC, making it highly concentrated in risk, far more so than QQQ. The entire market cap of the Taiwan stock market is less than that of Apple alone.</li>
<li>Question: I&rsquo;m concerned about the risk of war across the Taiwan Strait. I&rsquo;ve researched and found that historically, even in cases of defeat or occupation, the occupying force usually recognizes the stock assets of the citizens. Is this understanding correct?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your understanding is correct, but more importantly, the 00662 (QQQ) we invest in is a U.S. asset, holding the top 100 companies in the United States. Even if local assets in Taiwan are damaged, our U.S. dollar assets are safe. Therefore, it&rsquo;s more important to be prepared for personal safety (e.g., ensuring your passport is valid). From another perspective, when Taiwanese people invest in U.S. assets, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo; act because it helps to activate Taiwan&rsquo;s vast foreign exchange reserves, creating greater value for the entire society.</li>

<p>This session was a deep dive into the evolution of investment philosophy. Through the vivid &ldquo;animal evolution&rdquo; metaphor, Teacher James clearly analyzed the fundamental difference between successful and unsuccessful investors. It&rsquo;s not about how sophisticated their techniques are, but whether they can build a powerful system that can withstand extreme risks and endure through time cycles. The core strategy remains the beautifully simple &ldquo;buy and hold&rdquo; of a quality index fund (QQQ). At the same time, the course provided very practical guidance on asset activation and warned of the associated risks. Ultimately, investing is not just about accumulating wealth, but about gaining freedom of the mind to face life with composure and realize one&rsquo;s true value.</p>

      <description>In this session, Teacher James first shares the core investment philosophy of &amp;#39;The Bible of Wealth Management,&amp;#39; emphasizing the importance of long-term holding and buying at any time. Next, he deeply analyzes the high risks of real estate as an investment target and uses charts to detail the huge volatility and potential zeroing-out risk of leveraged ETFs (like TQQQ), stressing the necessity of &amp;#39;smart rebalancing.&amp;#39; The Q&amp;amp;A session explores practical issues such as personal consumption planning, asset allocation, rules for pledging stocks, decisions on buying and selling property, and the profound impact of the stablecoin bill.</description>

<p>The core of this session is the mindset and strategy investors should adopt in an ever-innovating market. Teacher James emphasizes that the market&rsquo;s long-term trend is upward, and one should enter as early as possible and hold on. At the same time, he deeply analyzes two common yet high-risk assets: real estate and leveraged funds. He argues that real estate is not a good investment and carries extremely high risk. As for leveraged funds, while their short-term returns are tempting, their violent fluctuations can lead to a total loss of investment. Therefore, it is essential to control risk and lock in profits through &ldquo;smart rebalancing.&rdquo; Ultimately, only index funds are quality assets that can be passed down through generations.</p>

<li>Teacher James once again recommended &ldquo;The Bible of Wealth Management,&rdquo; published in 1996, believing its philosophy is still highly relevant today and is a national treasure of a book.</li>
<li><strong>Core Philosophy</strong>: &ldquo;Buy anytime, buy casually, don&rsquo;t sell.&rdquo; This strategy, similar to buying and holding the entire market, aligns perfectly with the philosophy of index funds.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Compounding</strong>: The book gives an example: investing just 1200 yuan a month at a 20% rate of return can grow to 100 million in 40 years. This demonstrates the astonishing power of long-term investment; the key to wealth is investing, not saving or having a high income.</li>
<li><strong>The Root of Wealth Inequality</strong>: The book also mentions that wealth inequality stems from a lack of financial education, which aligns closely with the mission of this channel. If you don&rsquo;t have enough funds to retire at 65, the problem lies in your personal investment failures, not society.</li>

<li>The teacher clearly states that from a return on investment perspective, a house is not a good investment and is extremely risky.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Risk</strong>: A 30-to-40-year mortgage is like a chain. If you face a crisis like mid-life unemployment, you risk foreclosure. Without a mortgage, this worry doesn&rsquo;t exist.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Risk</strong>: Natural disasters like earthquakes and fires are frequent. Even with insurance, the process of rebuilding and relocating is filled with pain and inconvenience, like carrying a &ldquo;powder keg.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Judgment Standard</strong>: The teacher offers a vivid analogy: <strong>&ldquo;You should only buy your first house when you have the ability to buy two.&rdquo;</strong> Buying a house should be like buying slippers—if they break, you can easily get a new pair. Only then is it not a risk.</li>
<li><strong>The Correct Path</strong>: First, work hard on investing to become wealthy. When your wealth reaches a certain level (e.g., 100 million, 500 million), then use borrowed funds (e.g., borrow 20 million, 100 million) to easily buy a house, achieving a &ldquo;no-money-down&rdquo; acquisition.</li>
<li><strong>Index Funds are the True &ldquo;Real Estate&rdquo;</strong>: Compared to physical property that depreciates and has holding costs (like management fees, property taxes), only index funds are quality assets that can last for a century, be passed down through generations, and become more stable over time.</li>

<li><strong>Historical Simulation</strong>: The simulation shows that one dollar invested in TQQQ in 1985 would have grown to $3,510 at the peak of the 2000 dot-com bubble, but then crashed to $1.13 in the subsequent bear market, a staggering drop of 99.96%, nearly wiping it out.</li>
<li><strong>The Trap of Long-Term Returns</strong>: Over the long period from 1985 to the present, due to decay from market volatility, TQQQ (18.28% annualized) performed worse than the 2x leveraged QLD (19.39% annualized).</li>
<li><strong>The Long Recovery Period</strong>: After the 2000 crash, QQQ reached a new high around 2014, and QLD broke even around 2022. However, if you held only TQQQ, it could take over 22 years to recover your losses, which would be devastating to any retirement plan.</li>
<li><strong>The Only Solution for Risk Control: Smart Rebalancing</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: To prevent TQQQ from dropping over 99% from its peak, which would wipe out a lifetime of investment.</li>
<li><strong>Method</strong>: At the end of the year or the beginning of the next, transfer one-third of this year&rsquo;s profits from the leveraged fund to a cash position to lock in profits and reduce risk.</li>
<li><strong>Warning</strong>: The decline of a leveraged fund is instantaneous; it might go to zero before you have a chance to rebalance. Therefore, the amount invested must be money you can afford to lose completely. The teacher does not recommend leveraged funds for beginners or those unfamiliar with their characteristics. A 70/30 (QQQ/cash) allocation is relatively stable.</li>

<li><strong>Pledged Asset Line (PAL) Fund Flow Warning</strong>: For investors at Charles Schwab in the US, the teacher warned that their software is now very intelligent and can track the flow of funds borrowed through a PAL. Even after multiple transfers, if the funds eventually end up in a brokerage account and are used to buy stocks, the system will detect it. You might receive a warning the first time, and subsequently, your PAL privileges could be revoked. Be careful to avoid such operations.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: How to distinguish between necessary expenses and deferrable pleasures? For example, how to decide whether to buy a car or travel abroad? Is there a metric to avoid impacting future wealth through overspending?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a great question that can be solved with planning.
<ol>
<li><strong>Set a Goal</strong>: First, clarify your retirement goal, for instance, how much money you want in 20 years (e.g., 60 million).</li>
<li><strong>Calculate Required Investment</strong>: Use an investment calculator. Based on your current assets and expected rate of return (e.g., 14%), calculate how much you need to invest each month to reach your goal.</li>
<li><strong>Spend Freely</strong>: After deducting the required monthly investment from the money you can save, the remainder can be freely spent, used for travel, or put into a travel fund.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Adjustment</strong>: This calculation is dynamic. For example, if you have 10 million now and your goal is 60 million in 20 years, the calculator might show that you can even spend 66,000 per month and still reach your goal.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Don&rsquo;t save all your money; learn to spend it. You should start planning your consumption from a young age. As long as your retirement plan is not affected, you should enjoy life. Otherwise, earning a lot of money becomes meaningless. The teacher added that if you are going to spend, the memories from travel are eternal—a form of spiritual consumption more valuable than material goods that depreciate.</li>

<li>Sharing: After listening to the teacher&rsquo;s classes for three months, she cleared out over a dozen miscellaneous stocks in her Canadian Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) and switched everything to TQQQ and QLD. She convinced her husband they could retire because their assets were sufficient. She is now allocating cash and QQQ in her taxable account (IBKR).</li>
<li>Question: In the future, with new TFSA contribution room each year (e.g., C$7,000 per person) and new funds coming in monthly, how should she invest? Should she buy according to the target allocation (e.g., 40% QQQ, 35% cash, 15% TQQQ), prioritize building up the cash position, or decide based on the beta value at the time?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Account Separation</strong>: Leveraged funds (TQQQ/QLD) should be in the tax-free account (TFSA); QQQ and cash should be in the taxable account (IBKR).</li>
<li><strong>Tax-Free Account</strong>: When new contribution room is available, just buy more leveraged funds. Only rebalance if the leveraged funds become an excessively large portion of your total assets.</li>
<li><strong>Taxable Account</strong>: For new monthly funds, you can simplify the process. For example, in a year with 12 months, you could designate that the savings from 4 of those months go directly to cash, and the savings from the other 8 months are used to buy QQQ. This ensures the cash position grows, and you can review and do a major rebalancing at the end of the year.</li>

<li>Sharing: Responding to the previous student&rsquo;s question about consumption, he used to be someone who saved fanatically and was afraid to spend. After listening to the teacher, he understood that if you want to buy a car, for example, you can do so as long as you ensure you still have an equivalent amount of money to continue investing in QQQ. Between memories and material things, one should invest more in creating memories (like travel).</li>
<li>Question: He received an email and a call from QQQ about a special meeting to vote on changing the fund structure from a &ldquo;Unit Investment Trust (UIT)&rdquo; to an &ldquo;Open-End Fund.&rdquo; He wanted to ask for the teacher&rsquo;s opinion on this.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a normal and positive change. The vast majority of ETFs today (like QQQM) are already open-end funds. This change allows the fund to have its own board of directors for management, freeing it from bank trusteeship, which can lower fees and increase management flexibility. My personal recommendation is to vote &ldquo;approve.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Sharing: A client of his, a cardiologist from a wealthy family, was outbid for a luxury mansion by a woman. This woman offered a higher price and had 150 million USD in cash in her bank account, wealth that came entirely from early investments in stocks like Nvidia. This story illustrates that the wealth created by successful equity investing can easily surpass the accumulation of several generations of elite professionals.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: This is very normal. For someone who understands investing, 100 million USD is the minimum threshold. Your professional income doesn&rsquo;t determine your ultimate wealth; only long-term, stable financial investment is the key to riches.</li>

</li>
<li>Question: Why was the market reaction negative when the US government initially proposed to exchange subsidies for equity in companies like TSMC, but the stock price rose after the company refused? Aren&rsquo;t government subsidies the people&rsquo;s money? What&rsquo;s wrong with letting the government (the people) share in the profits?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You have to look at this from the perspective of shareholder interests.
<ol>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s Bad for Companies Not Lacking Cash</strong>: For a company with ample cash flow like TSMC, it doesn&rsquo;t need the money. Accepting government funds and issuing new shares to the government would dilute the equity of existing shareholders, which is detrimental to them. If the government wants to own TSMC stock, it should buy it on the open market, not ask the company to print shares for it.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s Good for Companies on the Brink of Bankruptcy</strong>: However, for companies in financial crisis like Ford and General Motors (GM) at the time, they desperately needed funds to survive, so they were willing to accept the government&rsquo;s terms for taking an equity stake. This was a bailout, not a normal business investment.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A healthy company has no reason to sacrifice shareholder interests to take government money.</li>

<li>Question 1: The teacher says pledged loans should not exceed 20% of total assets. Is there a percentage limit for non-pledged debt like personal loans and mortgages? His current debt of this type is about 40% of his total assets. Is this too high?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t worry at all. Personal loans and mortgages are completely different from pledged loans. They don&rsquo;t have market volatility risk and won&rsquo;t trigger a Margin Call if stock prices fall. As long as your salary plus the 2% withdrawal from your pledged line of credit can comfortably cover the interest and principal payments, this debt is safe. A 40% ratio is very healthy, far safer than someone with zero assets but a 9 million mortgage.</li>
</ul>

<li>Question 2: Since the 1-2% withdrawal from the pledged line of credit is enough to cover all the interest on his personal loans and mortgage, does this mean he can spend his entire salary and enjoy life?

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I recommend taking out the personal loan first. A personal loan is a loan without market volatility risk, making it relatively safer. You can take out the personal loan to invest in the market and then use the cash flow from your stock pledge (e.g., 2% annually) to pay off the interest and principal of the personal loan. Don&rsquo;t start by borrowing a large sum (like 20%) from your investment portfolio to reinvest; that would increase the risk associated with market fluctuations. Safety first.</li>

<li>Question 1: All her leveraged funds are in a Roth IRA account, and she plans to leave them untouched for another 15 years. Is a Beta value of 1.3 acceptable?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Absolutely not! 15 years is too short a time for a high-leverage allocation. If you encounter a major bear market (like in 2000), your assets might not recover before you retire. Historical data shows it took QLD (2x) 22 years to break even. A Beta of 1.3 is far too risky; you might not be able to retire smoothly. You must lower it immediately, do not exceed 1.0.</li>

<li><strong>Financial Priority</strong>: The huge financial difference is the primary consideration.</li>
<li><strong>Value of Time</strong>: The saved commuting time is for rest, relaxation, and enjoying life, not for taking on more work.</li>
<li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: While working, you can rent a cheap place in the countryside. When you actually retire, you can move back to the city. At that point, you can choose to rent or buy, giving you complete freedom. Don&rsquo;t sacrifice a huge present benefit for an uncertain future. Procrastinating is losing money.</li>

<li>Question 1: If the stablecoin bill (Genius Act) is so good, why is its implementation delayed until January 28th of next year?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: After any major bill is passed, it takes a few months for the executive branch to prepare the related regulations, website systems, registration processes, etc. This is a normal administrative preparation period, not an intentional delay.</li>

<li>Question 2: Elon Musk criticizes the government for inefficient spending, but according to Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), the more the government spends, the better it is for the economy. How does the teacher view this contradiction?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: From an investor&rsquo;s perspective, as long as the government is willing to spend money, whether it&rsquo;s spent wisely or not, it&rsquo;s a good thing. This is because money flowing stimulates the economy, which will ultimately be reflected in stock prices. The passage of the stablecoin bill will greatly increase market liquidity. When the Treasury issues a $1 bond and a bank buys it, the bank can then issue a $1 stablecoin using the bond as collateral. This effectively doubles the liquidity in the market, making capital extremely abundant. This is a huge positive for the stock market; stock prices will soar.</li>

<p>This session covered a rich and profound range of topics, from macroeconomic market trends and investment philosophy to specific asset risk analysis and practical personal financial planning. Teacher James once again reinforced the core strategy of long-term holding of index funds and provided an in-depth analysis and risk warning for two highly tempting yet perilous assets: real estate and leveraged funds. Through the specific method of &ldquo;smart rebalancing,&rdquo; he offered a clear risk control path for investors wishing to use leverage. The Q&amp;A session tightly integrated theory with real-life situations, providing clear guidance on everything from consumption and debt management to understanding new financial legislation. Overall, this was an invaluable lesson that reminds us to stay clear-headed in a bull market—to be brave in embracing growth while always respecting risk.</p>

      <description>This session&amp;#39;s core sharing focuses on shifting from a labor mindset to a rich mindset, learning how to leverage financial operations to consume with hundreds of times more assets than one&amp;#39;s own small capital, achieving continuous asset growth without selling. Teacher James elaborates on the importance of focusing on investing in the Nasdaq 100 index and refutes the drawbacks of other investment methods and financial products. The Q&amp;amp;A session delves into practical operational issues such as asset allocation, stock-backed loans, insurance, and cross-border asset management.</description>

<p>The core theme of this session is to <strong>break free from a labor mindset and establish a rich mindset</strong>. Traditional wisdom suggests that one needs to work hard, save money, and invest to get rich, while the core of a rich mindset is understanding how to utilize financial leverage. Teacher James illustrates with specific examples how a small principal (e.g., $30,000) can be used to spend far more than the principal (e.g., $1,000,000) through long-term low-interest borrowing (such as stock-backed loans), while the principal itself compounds in the market over the long term, with its future value sufficient to cover all debts. This financial operation of &ldquo;borrowing to spend, never selling assets&rdquo; is where the real big money is, far superior to the &ldquo;peanuts&rdquo; earned from stock picking and short-term trading.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on one, eliminate distractions</strong>: The only investment target is the Nasdaq 100 index fund (e.g., QQQ). Ignore market fluctuations, financial news, analyst opinions, financial reports, and any other recommended ETFs (such as VT, SPY, VTI, and various 0098x and other &ldquo;demonic&rdquo; codes in Taiwan). The teacher guarantees with 40+ years of investment experience that if there were a better target, he would have recommended it long ago.</li>
<li><strong>Trust in predecessors&rsquo; experience, avoid self-trial and error</strong>: Beginners should first accept the warning &ldquo;don&rsquo;t touch fire,&rdquo; meaning don&rsquo;t touch investment targets not recommended by the teacher. Asking questions won&rsquo;t teach you anything; you should calmly watch hundreds of videos first, and then the questions you have will be genuine. Learning from the wisdom and experience of predecessors (e.g., reading classics like &ldquo;Tao Te Ching,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Bible&rdquo;) can help avoid detours, which is the cheapest way to learn in life.</li>
<li><strong>Be highly vigilant of the financial system</strong>: You&rsquo;re alert when you receive a scam call, but you completely trust what financial advisors and insurance agents tell you, and that&rsquo;s the scariest scam. View the <strong>financial industry, insurance industry, and government</strong> as a united potential &ldquo;scam group,&rdquo; and be vigilant about any products they recommend.</li>
<li><strong>Advice for newcomers</strong>: New friends can start by watching video <strong>00451</strong> on our YouTube channel to build a basic understanding.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Consolidation</strong>: All funds and individual stocks should be converted into an asset allocation based on QQQ.</li>
<li><strong>Account Configuration Recommendations for US Investors</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Leveraged Funds (QLD, TQQQ)</strong>: Should be 99.99% placed in tax-advantaged retirement accounts (e.g., Roth IRA).</li>
<li><strong>Cash</strong>: Can be placed in any account, but for different purposes.
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash in Roth accounts</strong>: Used for &ldquo;smart rebalancing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Cash in Stock-Backed Loan Accounts (Pledge Account)</strong>: Used to reduce account volatility and prevent margin calls.</li>
<li><strong>Cash in Taxable Accounts or Traditional IRA</strong>: Used to slow down the appreciation rate of that account, which helps with tax planning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Warning for Non-US Residents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not open accounts with US brokers</strong>: Non-US tax residents will face up to 40% estate tax on assets in the US, and accounts may be frozen at any time. The process for descendants to handle inheritance is extremely cumbersome and complex, and lawyer fees may deplete most of the assets.</li>
<li><strong>Keep money close</strong>: Assets should remain in your country of residence. If you live in Taiwan, keep your money in Taiwan; if you live in Hong Kong, keep your money in Hong Kong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Financial Education</strong>: Educating children about finance is more important than academic performance. Children can have poor grades, they can be lazy, but they cannot be ignorant of financial management. In a capitalist society, knowing how to grow assets is more crucial than having a high degree but being a &ldquo;pauper.&rdquo; Cultivate independent thinking and judgment.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Misconceptions of traditional labor mindset</strong>: Believing that one must work hard, save diligently, and invest diligently to have money to spend. This is a passive and inefficient mindset that prevents an easy life.</li>
<li><strong>Core of Rich Mindset – Financial Operations</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>The Art of Borrowing</strong>: The core of borrowing is not to consider the interest rate first, but that the <strong>loan term should be as long as possible</strong>. If a loan can be repaid principal and interest in 40 years, even if the interest rate is as high as 8%, it&rsquo;s worth borrowing because inflation and asset appreciation will far exceed the interest cost.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging Small Capital for Large Assets</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: You currently have $30,000. At an annualized return of 15%, it will grow to nearly $7,000,000 in 40 years. Based on this enormous future asset, you now have the ability to borrow $1,000,000 to spend, as long as this loan is long-term, or even never requires principal repayment (like a stock-backed loan). Your asset growth rate will exceed your debt growth rate.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Don&rsquo;t spend your $30,000; let it snowball. The money you spend is borrowed. This is the essence of financial operations, which involves tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stop Focusing on Small Money</strong>: Don&rsquo;t dwell on stock picking, short-term trading, and other behaviors aimed at earning price differences. These are insignificant like sesame seeds compared to the grand scope of financial operations.</li>

<li>Question 1: Regarding workplace salary, I asked my boss for a $20,000 raise and a $50,000 bonus. My boss agreed to the raise but refused the bonus, which I accepted. I felt that the long-term nature of salary was more important than a one-time bonus. I&rsquo;d like to ask for Teacher James&rsquo;s opinion.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your decision was absolutely correct. Supervisors are usually willing to give raises because the money belongs to the company, not them personally. A fixed salary increase is permanent, while a bonus is one-time and can be canceled by the company at any time. This aligns with our philosophy of long-term investing, which seeks stable and continuous growth (15% annually) rather than short-term spikes (a single day&rsquo;s surge). You&rsquo;ve grasped the key point.</li>

<li>Share 1: I only discovered the teacher&rsquo;s channel in late August and felt like I&rsquo;d struck gold. Within a week, I invested all my funds into the market and plan to invest the money from cashing out my endowment insurance.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Excellent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Share 2: I shared the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy with a beauty industry group I founded, hoping my peers could also benefit, as many in our industry receive advance payments from clients, which serves as excellent interest-free cash flow for investment. However, some people left the group as soon as they heard about investing, which made me feel frustrated and regretful.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: This is a very typical reaction. Topics like investing and politics should not be shared casually in non-homogeneous groups. Every group has its inherent attributes, and abruptly introducing unrelated topics, like discussing politics in a group, will inevitably cause a &ldquo;commotion.&rdquo; You must anticipate such a reaction. Also, a reminder: for advance payments received by businesses, you need to reserve sufficient working capital for operations and not over-invest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 1: A client of mine, almost 50 years old, thinks this investment method is too slow and that one doesn&rsquo;t have many 40-year periods in life. I&rsquo;d like to hear the teacher&rsquo;s insights. Also, should the funds from my surrendered endowment insurance all be invested in 00865B (Taiwanese short-term government bond ETF) as cash, or do I need to keep some in a savings account at the bank?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Regarding your client&rsquo;s question, this is a difference in mindset. For fund allocation, cash does not need to be kept in the bank. 00865B has excellent liquidity; if you sell today, the money arrives the day after tomorrow, so it can be used entirely as cash. For daily expenses, try to use credit cards, and then sell 00865B once to repay the bill. Your subsequent income can be vaguely and randomly invested into 00662, 00670L, and 00865B, no need to be overly precise, for example, rotating among the three every four months.</li>

<li>Question 1: I&rsquo;m 53. Due to government housing policies, I&rsquo;m considering selling my self-occupied home in Taoyuan at a low price and renting instead, which would give me about 5 million in cash. Should I use this money to pay off my car loan and personal loan first, and then invest the remaining money using a 70/30 or 60/13/30 strategy? Also, I pay a lot for insurance every month, and some policies are nearing their maturity. What should I do?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You can sell the house and invest the money. But <strong>absolutely do not use the money from selling the house to pay off any loans</strong>. Borrowed money is &ldquo;someone else&rsquo;s chicken&rdquo;; let it lay eggs. Your own money is &ldquo;your own chicken&rdquo;; let it lay eggs too. Use your future salary from re-entering the workforce to make monthly installment payments. For insurance, <strong>immediately, right now, surrender all of it</strong>; take back whatever you can. As long as you stop paying, you win, and you&rsquo;ll have tens of millions more in the future.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Regarding the order of placing leveraged funds in accounts, why would Traditional IRA/401k be prioritized over a Brokerage Account? This seems to contradict the idea of &ldquo;putting cash in a Traditional account to slow appreciation.&rdquo; Moreover, future withdrawals from Traditional accounts are taxed at Income Tax rates, which are higher than Brokerage&rsquo;s Capital Gain Tax rates.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This question is more complex. The core reasons are: 1) Leveraged funds cannot be used for stock-backed loans. Placing leveraged funds in a Brokerage account would &ldquo;pollute&rdquo; this account, which might be used for pledging in the future. 2) Leveraged funds have high volatility and will inevitably require rebalancing, which would incur taxes if done in a Brokerage account. Although the future tax rate in a Traditional account is higher, it provides a &ldquo;tax deferral&rdquo; effect, allowing you to operate freely internally without tax worries. More importantly, you don&rsquo;t need to allocate leverage in every account. <strong>The core is to maintain the overall investment portfolio&rsquo;s Beta value at 1.0.</strong> You can achieve Beta 1.0 through leveraged funds in Roth accounts and cash or QQQ in Traditional/Brokerage accounts. This results in the same return but with a superior tax structure and risk control.</li>

<li>Share 1: After listening to the teacher&rsquo;s class, I decided to cancel a life insurance policy I had paid for 7 years, at CAD 20,000 per year. Although I lost CAD 100,000, I felt relieved. My husband also agreed because I calculated for him that even if we only got back a portion of this money, its value in 40 years would far exceed the CAD 1,000,000 insured amount. I don&rsquo;t regret my past decisions because they were made with the knowledge I had at the time, but now my understanding has upgraded.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Excellent sharing and decision. Having tens of millions in assets while alive is far more meaningful than receiving a million in insurance after death.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 1: I&rsquo;m 50 and plan to sell an investment property, expecting CAD 900,000 in cash. How should I allocate this large sum into my planned configuration of 40% QQQ, 15% QLD, 10% TQQQ, and 35% cash?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: For someone nearing retirement, safety is paramount. First, calculate how many years of living expenses you&rsquo;ll need after retirement and prepare <strong>at least 10-15 years of cash</strong>. For example, if you spend 60,000 a year, you&rsquo;ll need 600,000 in cash for 10 years. Set this money aside first, and then allocate the remaining funds according to your asset allocation ratio.</li>

<li>Share 1: My short-term trading for the past 10 years ultimately amounted to nothing, but in the past two years, I switched to long-term QQQ investing, yielding substantial returns.</li>
<li>Question 1: I leveraged an additional NT$15 million from real estate in Taiwan, with an interest rate of 2.88%, renewed annually, with no principal repayment required. Is it feasible to invest this money and then use a portion of the investment profits to pay the interest, continuing this operation? Also, I am currently in the US, with most of my assets in Taiwan. Is this long-term plan suitable?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Short-term operations are feasible. But in the long run, if you and your children will eventually settle in the US, assets should ultimately be transferred to the US. This is primarily to simplify estate planning and avoid Taiwan&rsquo;s relatively high estate tax on large cash assets. The US estate tax exemption is much higher than Taiwan&rsquo;s. You need to be aware of the potential risks and penalties of not declaring overseas assets to the IRS and plan accordingly.</li>

You can adopt a 70/30 strategy, meaning 70% of the funds are bought immediately, and the remaining 30% is held as cash (invested in a money market fund). Don&rsquo;t be afraid of buying at a high point; looking back a few years from now, any current price will seem low.</li>

<li>Question 1: In the US, for investment purposes, would forming one&rsquo;s own company (e.g., LLC) be better than individual investment? For example, one could establish a Solo 401K, etc., to put more tax-free funds.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>Absolutely not</strong>. This is an unnecessary complication that will only bring endless trouble, such as accounting, tax filing, company maintenance, etc. For long-term investors who don&rsquo;t sell, a personal Brokerage account is already very tax-optimized, so there&rsquo;s no need to complicate things for a little extra Roth space. The benefits are minimal, and the drawbacks are numerous.</li>

<li>Question 1: In the teacher&rsquo;s simulation, the final asset multiple of the 433 configuration without pledging (5.8x) was higher than that with pledging (4.somethingx). So why should we still choose stock-backed loans?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The simulation results depend on the historical market path. Our simulated period (starting from the 2000 high) was a &ldquo;volatile market&rdquo; with a sharp ten-year decline followed by a slow recovery. In such a market, &ldquo;mindless rebalancing&rdquo; (without pledging) performs better because it dares to buy heavily during downturns. However, in a long-term bull market (e.g., 1980-2000), &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; (with pledging) would outperform. The most important reason we choose pledging is not to pursue the highest return, but to <strong>ensure survival in extreme markets and avoid liquidation.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: When actually taking out a stock-backed loan, where does the monthly interest come from? Is it reserved from the $200,000 borrowed?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: No. The interest should also be borrowed. Your total loan limit is very high (e.g., $6 million on $10 million in assets), and you only borrowed $200,000. The monthly interest, a few hundred dollars, can be directly borrowed from your available credit limit. This way, your debt will increase slowly, but your assets will grow at a faster rate.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>You currently have 300 dollars, you should be able to spend 10,000 dollars.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight concisely explains the power of financial leverage. Your purchasing power should not be determined by your current cash, but by the potential future value of your assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hard work has no future&hellip; Making money work hard is what truly matters.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight overturns traditional values, emphasizing the importance of passive income and asset appreciation. The core is to make capital work for you, not the other way around.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re even vigilant when you receive a scam call, but you completely trust what your financial advisor tells you, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s truly terrifying.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight uses a strong contrast to warn investors that they must maintain independent judgment and critical thinking towards all financial institutions&rsquo; advice, not blindly trusting them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The financial industry, the insurance industry, and the government, combined, are a scam group.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight, in an extreme way, reminds investors to be highly wary of complex products recommended by all financial institutions, as their goal is usually to earn your fees and commissions, not to serve your best interests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Beta is the same, the volatility is the same, the return rate is the same.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight is the scientific core of asset allocation. The return of an investment portfolio is determined by its overall market risk exposure (Beta), not by how many &ldquo;magical&rdquo; leveraged products it contains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I actually didn&rsquo;t feel much pain, discomfort, or regret&hellip; because that was the decision I made based on my understanding at the time, but now I&rsquo;m different.
&ndash; Jenny</p></blockquote>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s reflection when sharing her decision to surrender a loss-making insurance policy embodies the process of an investor&rsquo;s mental maturation: not being trapped by past sunk costs, but bravely making the right decision based on a higher level of understanding now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not a truth you&rsquo;ve realized yourself, there&rsquo;s no extra profit in it for you, because it belongs to others.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasizes the importance of independent thinking and truly understanding investment philosophy. Following the crowd or using strategies one doesn&rsquo;t understand, even if profitable in the short term, cannot be sustained in the long run because it doesn&rsquo;t fall within one&rsquo;s own circle of competence.</p>

<p>This gathering was a profound course in reshaping financial intelligence. Teacher James fundamentally challenged the traditional notion of &ldquo;work hard, save money to get rich,&rdquo; clearly advocating a rich mindset centered on &ldquo;financial operations.&rdquo; Through the strategy of &ldquo;borrowing to consume, never selling assets,&rdquo; investors can break free from dependence on active income, allowing assets to calmly compound in the market over the long term. The Q&amp;A session served as a rich case study, applying this core concept to diverse real-world scenarios such as salary negotiations, insurance decisions, large-sum asset deployment, and cross-border asset management, providing listeners with extremely valuable practical guidance and mindset building. The entire sharing was not just about &ldquo;technique&rdquo; (how to invest), but more about &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; (how to think about wealth).</p>

<p>This session&rsquo;s theme revolves around &ldquo;The market always goes up, live for yourself.&rdquo; The core idea is that the essence of investing is very simple: believe in the market&rsquo;s long-term upward trend and hold on. The real challenge is psychological. Therefore, we should not be disturbed by short-term market fluctuations, financial news, world events, or other external information. Instead, we should shift our focus back to life itself—concentrating on health, happiness, family, and personal values, viewing money as a tool to achieve freedom and abundance in life, not as the ultimate goal.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth and Happiness</strong>: Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right, and health is the foundation. Money is just a tool to achieve a free, abundant, and happy life; investing itself is not the purpose of life.</li>
<li><strong>Children&rsquo;s Education</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Focus on cultivating the right values in children (not stealing, robbing, breaking the law, or taking drugs) and appreciating their talents, rather than just focusing on academic performance.</li>
<li>Parents should not impose their own expectations or unfulfilled dreams on their children, such as forcing them to study abroad. This puts immense pressure on the children.</li>
<li>A true home is where the parents are. Children should be encouraged to pursue their own ideals, not to satisfy their parents&rsquo; expectations.</li>
<li>Compared to buying a house for a child, it&rsquo;s better to have and raise the child first, because wealth can be created, but childbirth has a time window.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Live in the Present, Focus on Yourself</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In life, focus on your own goals. Don&rsquo;t get sidetracked by trivial matters (like fussing over exchange rates or searching for better investments), as this will only delay the process of achieving financial freedom.</li>
<li>Teacher James uses his own management experience as an example: At the company, he focused on only the three most important tasks each day. Once completed, he could go home. This approach is efficient and goal-oriented. Conversely, trying to do everything results in being busy all day with nothing accomplished.</li>
<li>Live your own life, not one led by the media and online information. Cutting off useless external information will not result in any loss.</li>
<li>True living is about &ldquo;presence&rdquo;—living in the moment. Whether eating, gardening, or traveling, you should be fully engaged and feel the beauty of life itself. External distractions, like what Trump said, have no bearing on our lives or investments.</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do the Right Thing and Persist</strong>: The secret to successful investing is to &ldquo;do the right thing and stick with it for the long term.&rdquo; For example, invest whenever you have money, regardless of the exchange rate, without timing the market. Once you have identified the right path (like investing in QQQ), you should forge ahead without looking back.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Mortgage</strong>:
<ul>
<li>This is an excellent tool for &ldquo;activating assets&rdquo; and is not just for people short on cash.</li>
<li>It provides a steady cash flow, as if the house is working for you. This money can be used for investment, thus increasing your assets while retaining the property.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a great option for parents with insufficient retirement funds, allowing them to live better lives without their children needing to provide financial support.</li>
<li>For elderly individuals with weak financial management skills and only one house left, a reverse mortgage is more stable than selling the house to invest, avoiding the risk of losing their last home.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Borrowing to Invest</strong>:
<ul>
<li>An example: If you use your own $30,000 to buy a car, the potential value of that money in 50 years (about $32 million) is lost. But if you take a pledged loan of $30,000 to buy the car and invest your own $30,000, in 50 years you will have $32 million in assets, while the debt is only $340,000.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Make good use of financial leverage. Borrow for consumption or investment, and let your own money continue to grow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example of Leveraged Asset Allocation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Teacher James shares his asset allocation model: 40% QQQ (1x), 15% QLD (2x), 10% TQQQ (3x), and 35% cash.</li>
<li>The Beta value of this portfolio is calculated as: (40% * 1) + (15% * 2) + (10% * 3) = 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.3 = 1.0.</li>
<li>This allocation, while having an overall risk comparable to holding 100% QQQ (Beta=1.0), retains a large amount of cash (35%) for risk control and rebalancing during market downturns.</li>
<li><strong>Key Point</strong>: Any asset allocation that includes leveraged funds <strong>must</strong> implement a smart rebalancing strategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Sharing: After renting out a house he owns, he recently took it back for his own use and found being a landlord very troublesome. He had to deal with various damages and cleaning for walls, doors, and windows, and deeply realized that the actual return on real estate investment is not as high as it seems.</li>
<li>Question 1: Since the house was bought by his family, he can&rsquo;t sell it freely. He&rsquo;s thinking of taking out a mortgage-like loan on the house (interest-only payments) and investing the cash into 00662. Is this idea feasible?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Absolutely correct, you should do it immediately. Borrow any money you can as soon as possible. The power of borrowing to invest is immense.

<li>Question 2: The teacher advises young people to invest first and buy a house later when they are &ldquo;old.&rdquo; What age does &ldquo;old&rdquo; approximately refer to?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You will know when the time comes; you don&rsquo;t need someone else to tell you. When you are wealthy enough, buying a house will be as easy as buying slippers, and you can even use borrowed money to buy one casually. At that point, you could also choose to live in a luxurious retirement community—the choice is yours.</li>

<li>Question: She is in her fifties/sixties and wants to take out a pledged loan in China on her fully paid-off house, but banks only offer a maximum term of 3-5 years, which is too risky. How does the teacher obtain long-term loans?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The best long-term loan is a &ldquo;stock-pledged loan,&rdquo; which can be structured to never pay back the principal, and even the interest can be rolled into the principal. Mortgages and personal loans have fixed terms and are not suitable. For short-term loans (like 3-5 years), don&rsquo;t borrow unless you are confident you can repay even if the market crashes. He suggests she sell her house in China, even at a lower price, as long as she can liquidate it. Abroad, she can try using Interactive Brokers (IB) for stock-pledged loans.</li>

<li>Sharing: Inspired by the teacher, he successfully borrowed a large sum of money from the bank against his assets and discovered that car loans don&rsquo;t count towards his debt ratio. He plans to use a 2% pledged loan to pay off the car loan, thereby investing more funds into the 433 allocation. He now feels that the speed of his asset growth has surpassed his annual salary.</li>
<li>Question: He saw a YouTuber say that Chinese engineers in Silicon Valley are unhappy due to endless &ldquo;comparisons&rdquo; (of degrees, companies, salaries, houses, wives, children). As someone with a master&rsquo;s degree, he also felt insecure in an environment full of PhDs. How does the teacher view &ldquo;comparison&rdquo;? And how can the teacher confidently pay his subordinates a higher salary than his own?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Quoting Munger, &ldquo;Envy is a really stupid sin.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t compare; the key is a strong inner self. You must affirm from within that you are the best. The way you see yourself is more important than how others see you. He uses his own experience of leading a team of PhDs without a PhD himself, and designing Microsoft&rsquo;s Media architecture and the computer Hibernate patent, to illustrate that success is unrelated to academic degrees but is related to confidence and intellect.</li>

<li>Question 1: She is 60 and retired. As recommended, she has allocated TQQQ in her smaller Roth IRA account. However, the AI on Chen Feng&rsquo;s website advises her not to use leverage at her age and to keep many years of cash. How much cash should a retiree actually keep? Is it 30% or 15 years&rsquo; worth of living expenses?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t fully trust the AI; follow the teacher&rsquo;s instruction. Her allocation (TQQQ in Roth, cash in Traditional IRA) is correct. Retirees should keep <strong>30% cash</strong>, which is approximately equivalent to <strong>15 years&rsquo; worth</strong> of living expenses. This is not due to pessimism about the market; on the contrary, the market may rise even faster in the future. This is the result of the CLEC investment system&rsquo;s &ldquo;DNA evolution&rdquo; after being tested by the market, making it better able to withstand future extreme risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: She saw other financial bloggers advocating for market timing using &ldquo;economic indicator signals&rdquo; and is worried that buying TQQQ at a market high will lead to significant decay.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t refer to other people&rsquo;s investment systems; they won&rsquo;t be compatible. Within the 433 asset allocation, there is no so-called &ldquo;decay&rdquo; problem for TQQQ because the large cash reserve acts as a buffer, and the actual drop of the portfolio during a downturn will be less than that of 100% QQQ.</li>

<li>Question 1: She is 43 and just immigrated to the US. Her 401k and IRA accounts have very little money. To implement the 433 allocation, it seems she can only buy leveraged ETFs in a taxable brokerage account. Is this acceptable?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes. In the early stages when funds are insufficient, you can use a 433 allocation in a brokerage account to maintain a higher Beta and sufficient cash. Although rebalancing will generate taxes, the priority is to &ldquo;make money first.&rdquo; However, you must <strong>do smart rebalancing every year</strong>, because a 30% leveraged position is very risky and cannot be left unattended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: For dollar-cost averaging for an 11-year-old child, the teacher previously recommended QLD. Why not the better TQQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: TQQQ has extremely high volatility. Calculating from the 2000 peak, it might take over 20 years to break even, whereas QLD breaks even faster. For a child&rsquo;s long-term investment of over 20 years, both are acceptable, but the premise is that you <strong>must persist in buying continuously</strong>, regardless of market ups and downs. If the investment horizon is uncertain or you want to be more conservative, QLD is the safer choice.</li>

<li>Question: Should high-net-worth families be concerned about the 40% US estate tax? Should they set up an irrevocable trust in advance to avoid it?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: First, the US estate tax exemption has been permanently set at $15 million per person, meaning a couple has a $30 million exemption. Most families don&rsquo;t need to worry. Second, he does not recommend setting up an irrevocable charitable trust because they usually require an annual donation of 5% of assets, which is a huge burden and constraint on the children. A better way is to use the annual gift tax exclusion (e.g., $20,000) and start gifting early. Over the long term, the growth of the gifted assets will far exceed the estate tax exemption amount.</li>

<li>Question: She (in Canada) obtained extra cash for investment through a home refinance. Can the interest on this portion of the loan be deducted as an investment expense for tax purposes?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Only when you sell an asset and generate a realized capital gain do you have taxable investment income against which related expenses might be deducted. If you just hold and don&rsquo;t sell, there is no taxable event. Canada&rsquo;s Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is similar to the US Roth IRA, and investment and rebalancing operations should be conducted within it.</li>

<li>Question (from the comment section): With 30 million TWD in assets, if I withdraw 2% for living expenses, 600,000 per year is not enough. Do I have to wait until my assets double to 60 million to live a good life?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Not necessarily. You can increase the withdrawal rate by adjusting your asset allocation. For example, you can change the 433 allocation (Beta=1) to a 424 or 514 allocation with a higher cash percentage, which lowers the portfolio&rsquo;s volatility (Beta&lt;1). Once the volatility is reduced, the annual withdrawal rate can be safely increased to 3% or 3.5%.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right, and health is the foundation of life.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: At the beginning of the class, the teacher explained the relationship between investment and life, emphasizing that our ultimate goals are happiness and health, while wealth is an innate right and a tool to achieve those goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you living your own life, or a life defined by the external environment? Don&rsquo;t be led by outside information.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: The teacher advised students not to be engrossed in media and online information all day, as that is living a life defined by others, not their own. One should return to their inner self and focus on their own life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Envy is a really stupid sin.
&ndash; Teacher James (quoting Charlie Munger)</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When answering a student&rsquo;s question about &ldquo;comparison,&rdquo; the teacher quoted Munger&rsquo;s famous line, pointing out that comparing oneself to others is a source of unhappiness and a foolish act.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are what you think you are, and that is more important than how others see you. If you don&rsquo;t even believe in what you are, how can others believe in what you are?
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: The teacher encouraged students to build self-confidence. He believes that personal value is determined by self-perception, not by external evaluations or labels like academic degrees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When borrowing money, we don&rsquo;t fear high interest rates; we fear that the term is too short.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When answering a question about loans, the teacher stressed the importance of the loan term. As long as the term is long enough, even with a higher interest rate, the long-term growth of assets is sufficient to cover the costs, whereas short-term loans carry immense risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be clear about what you want. For everything else that is different from what you want, you don&rsquo;t need to care, you don&rsquo;t need to mind, and you don&rsquo;t need to compare.
&ndash; Chen Feng</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Student Chen Feng shared this perspective when explaining how he avoids the &ldquo;comparison&rdquo; mindset. He believes that as long as you are clear about your own goals, you will not be disturbed by external factors unrelated to them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you keep following our DNA, your DNA will evolve. This is how you can prepare for potential future risks and changes.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When explaining why he now recommends holding more cash (30%), the teacher compared the CLEC investment system to a biological DNA. This system continuously evolves after being tested by the market, becoming better adapted to various future environments. Therefore, students need to keep learning to acquire this &ldquo;evolved&rdquo; and robust system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are 100% in leveraged funds, you might go to hell; it would be like a dream that ends in 30 years.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When reminding students of the risks of leveraged funds, the teacher seriously pointed out that being fully invested in leveraged funds without asset allocation and rebalancing could ultimately lead to a total loss in a major market crash.</p>

<p>This session once again emphasized the core of the CLEC investment philosophy: investing is simple, mindset is supreme. Starting from a high-level life philosophy, Teacher James guided everyone to shift their focus from the complex noise of the market to the simple purity of their personal lives, fostering the belief to &ldquo;live for yourself.&rdquo; The course not only shared profound insights on children&rsquo;s education and self-worth realization but also delved into the practical application of financial tools like &ldquo;reverse mortgages&rdquo; and &ldquo;pledged loans.&rdquo; It also provided detailed explanations on the risk control and long-term operational principles of asset allocation (especially the 433 strategy involving leveraged funds). Through active questions and sharing from students, many practical confusions—such as allocation in different accounts, tax issues, and retirement cash flow planning—were clearly answered. Ultimately, the course returned to a fundamental point: build a strong inner self and adhere to the right principles, and wealth will naturally follow.</p>

<li><strong>Core Philosophy</strong>: The market has no ceiling; it will only go higher. The simplest and most effective investment method is to &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, and never sell.&rdquo; The only thing investors need to do is buy; they don&rsquo;t even need to consider selling. This simple truth is often not understood by the public, while the media prefers sensational and &ldquo;bloodthirsty&rdquo; headlines to attract attention.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Cannot Be Taught, Only Learned</strong>: The teacher stresses that even if the audience listens to what he says, they may not truly learn it. True mastery comes from investors spending their own time watching videos, thinking independently, and studying.</li>

<li><strong>Action</strong>: First, save up <strong>one year</strong> of emergency funds (in cash or a money market fund). Any amount exceeding the emergency fund should be fully invested in QQQ or 00662.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If your annual expense is 100,000 and your total assets are 160,000, then 100,000 should be kept as an emergency fund, and only 60,000 can be invested.</li>
<li><strong>Turning Point</strong>: When the cash portion can reach about 30% of your total assets, and this amount already exceeds one year&rsquo;s expenses, you can start considering a more systematic asset allocation. For example, with total assets of 500,000 and annual expenses of 100,000, 30% cash is 150,000, which is higher than the 100,000 emergency fund requirement. At this point, you can start asset allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation and Pledging Strategy for High-Net-Worth Individuals (433 Model)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Case Study</strong>: A 35-year-old friend with 60 million in assets uses a 433 asset allocation (40% QQQ, 30% QLD, 30% short-term bonds/cash).</li>
<li><strong>2% Living Expense Rule</strong>: Borrow 2% of <strong>total assets</strong> annually for living expenses through stock pledging. In this case, it&rsquo;s 2% of 60 million, which is 1.2 million per year. <strong>The key is that it&rsquo;s based on total assets, not 2% of a single holding (like QQQ)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Long-Term Growth</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In the 10th year: Total assets are expected to grow from 60 million to about 200 million, while total debt (including interest) will be around 14 million, resulting in a very healthy debt ratio of only 7%.</li>
<li>At that point, the living expense standard can be raised, for example, to live on 1% (2 million/year) or 2% (4 million/year) of 200 million.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rebalancing and Taxes</strong>: After significant asset growth, you can re-allocate your assets. For U.S. investors, rebalancing within a ROTH account can effectively avoid capital gains tax, which is highly efficient.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Health First: Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Importance</strong>: The teacher strongly recommends that everyone, especially friends over 40, pay for an LDCT lung cancer screening.</li>
<li><strong>Judgment Criteria</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If a nodule smaller than 0.6cm is found, there is no need to worry excessively; annual follow-ups are sufficient.</li>
<li>If a nodule larger than 0.8cm is found, you must immediately consult a thoracic specialist. The doctor will arrange for follow-up tracking (usually covered by health insurance). If the nodule shows signs of growth during the observation period, it needs to be dealt with promptly.</li>

<li>Question 1: My son lives in Taiwan, but his US dollar income is directly deposited into a Hong Kong account. Should he bring the money back to Taiwan to buy 00662, or open an account in Hong Kong to buy QQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The core principle is &ldquo;<strong>If you are in Taiwan, your money should be in Taiwan</strong>.&rdquo; Funds should not be kept in Hong Kong. Remit the money back to Taiwan and declare it as income for tax purposes normally. Don&rsquo;t worry about exchange rate fluctuations; in the long run, the average exchange rate from remitting in batches will tend towards an expected value. The exchange rate is irrelevant to long-term investment. If you have money, you should buy immediately and not let the exchange rate influence your decision.</li>

<li>Question 2: Regarding the 60 million asset case, living off a 2% pledge (1.2 million) annually, if I only need 1% (600,000), should I only withdraw 1%, or withdraw 2% and invest the extra 1% back?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Just withdraw the 1% you need. You can choose not to use the extra credit line, or you can borrow it to reinvest, which will make you grow faster. Both are acceptable.</li>

<li>Question 1: She is 63 this year and has already converted part of her Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Her company&rsquo;s 401k also allows Roth contributions. Should she, from now on, choose Roth for everything she can convert and contribute to?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes, that is very correct and urgent. First, all future contributions should go into a Roth 401k. Second, she has 1.7M in a Traditional IRA and must speed up the conversion. Otherwise, she will face a huge tax burden at age 75 due to RMD (Required Minimum Distribution). Based on calculations, she needs to convert about 270,000 per year to finish before age 75. It&rsquo;s easier to convert now while she has work income than after retirement when she has no cash flow. Consider borrowing from a pledged account to pay the conversion tax.</li>

<li>Question 1: Is it necessary for high-net-worth individuals to do stock pledging?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Not necessarily, but this is precisely the difference between being &ldquo;<strong>rich</strong>&rdquo; and being &ldquo;<strong>super-rich</strong>.&rdquo; He used a striking example: with 60 million in assets, if you use pledged loans for living expenses (allowing the principal to compound at 15%), your net worth could reach <strong>15.8 billion</strong> after 40 years. However, if you don&rsquo;t pledge and instead sell assets for living expenses each year (causing the total return rate to drop to 13%), your assets will only be <strong>800 million</strong> after 40 years, a difference of nearly 20 times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: What should be the order of borrowing? Mortgage, personal loan, stock pledge—which takes priority?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You can use lower-interest mortgages or personal loans to borrow funds and invest them in the market (buy QQQ/00662), and then use the money borrowed from stock pledging to pay the monthly installments of the mortgage or personal loan. This frees up your salary, allowing 100% of it to be reinvested, creating a powerful positive cycle. This is the most efficient way to grow wealth.</li>

In theory, <strong>the more you know, the easier it should be to communicate with others in simpler, more accessible terms</strong>, just like a university professor can explain complex mathematical concepts to a middle school student. The key to communication is to listen and adjust your frequency to match the other person&rsquo;s, rather than adopting a &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; mentality. If the other person cannot accept it, you can say, &ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; and end the conversation.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1 (The Importance of Roth): She is in the US, and one of the biggest changes after getting to know the teacher was converting all her 401k to Roth. She reminds everyone that a Traditional 401k is only tax-deferred, not tax-free. For those who know how to invest, retirement accounts will grow to a very large amount, and withdrawals from a traditional account will face terrifying tax rates. Young people must choose Roth.</li>
<li>Sharing 2 (New US Tax Law Rule): As a payroll system expert, she shared a new rule effective in 2025: for people over 50 with an annual income exceeding $145,000, their additional &ldquo;Catch-up&rdquo; contributions can only be put into a Roth 401k, no longer into a pre-tax Traditional 401k.</li>
<li>Sharing 3 (Pledging vs. Selling): She strongly agrees with the teacher&rsquo;s &ldquo;chicken and golden egg&rdquo; analogy. Selling stocks is like killing the chicken that lays golden eggs. Not only is the chicken gone, but you also have to pay taxes on the income from selling the chicken, which is a double loss. Pledging allows the chicken to continue laying eggs; you are just borrowing some future eggs. It is a superior strategy.</li>
<li>Question: She is planning her post-retirement operational sequence: first, sell company stock and convert to QQQ; then, convert SPY to QQQ; and finally, convert Traditional 401k to Roth annually as needed. She asks if this sequence is reasonable.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The sequence is reasonable. The key is to calculate and control the annual operations to fall within the ideal tax bracket. He also suggests that she can allocate some cash within her Traditional 401k to slow its growth rate, thereby reducing the future tax burden upon conversion. However, she should also be careful not to sacrifice too much of the overall portfolio&rsquo;s return (Beta) in the process.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The market has no ceiling, it will only go higher, so you don&rsquo;t have to do anything, you don&rsquo;t have to worry, it will hit new highs and bring you immense wealth.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: At the beginning of the session, the teacher emphasized the mindset investors should have—a firm belief in the long-term upward trend of the market, which is the cornerstone of adopting a &ldquo;buy and hold&rdquo; strategy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investing can&rsquo;t be taught, it can only be learned by oneself. You won&rsquo;t get it just by listening to me. If you don&rsquo;t learn it yourself, you won&rsquo;t get it.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: After introducing numerous learning tools, the teacher stressed the importance of proactive learning and self-exploration in the field of investment. Attending lectures is just the starting point; true understanding requires personal practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are in Taiwan, your money should be in Taiwan.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When answering Bruce&rsquo;s question about his son&rsquo;s US dollar income in Hong Kong, the teacher gave this clear and concise principle, emphasizing that funds should be consistent with one&rsquo;s place of residence for ease of management and tax compliance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This (pledging or not) is the difference between being rich and being super-rich.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When explaining why one should use stock pledging, the teacher used an example showing a nearly twenty-fold difference in assets after 40 years, vividly illustrating the huge impact of using (or not using) leverage tools on the ultimate scale of wealth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your salary is the so-called GDP, and your salary increase is GDP growth. Your assets are the result of past accumulation, so our market value is the result of past accumulation.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When refuting the bearish market argument that the &ldquo;Market Cap to GDP ratio is too high,&rdquo; the teacher used the analogy of personal salary versus total assets to clearly reveal the logical fallacy of this indicator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more you know, the easier it should be to communicate with people.
&ndash; Teacher James
Background: In response to a student&rsquo;s confusion about finding it harder to communicate as they learn more, the teacher pointed out that true wisdom is demonstrated by the ability to simplify complexity and communicate effectively with people at different levels of understanding.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you just sell stocks&hellip; you are essentially killing one of your chickens. Not only will this chicken no longer lay eggs for you, but the chicken itself is also gone.
&ndash; Penny</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: In her sharing, Penny used the vivid &ldquo;killing the goose that lays the golden eggs&rdquo; analogy to profoundly explain the essential difference and the pros and cons between selling stocks for living expenses and using stock pledging to borrow funds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely impossible to become wealthy through work. People who work longer might even become poorer. Only those who understand will become rich, and those who know how to borrow money will become super-rich.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Commenting on the prevalent societal belief of &ldquo;getting rich through hard work,&rdquo; the teacher revealed the truth about wealth growth, emphasizing the importance of financial literacy and the skillful use of leverage.</p>

<p>This session began by reaffirming the investment anchor of &ldquo;buy and hold, never sell,&rdquo; instilling strong confidence in investors amidst a volatile market. Teacher James and senior student Chen Feng detailed the newly integrated AI learning platform, tools that will significantly enhance students&rsquo; efficiency in self-directed learning. The core discussion, through an analysis of asset allocation strategies for young people and high-net-worth individuals, clearly outlined a path to wealth from accumulation to the skillful use of capital. The in-depth interpretation of stock pledging, in particular, revealed its immense potential as a wealth amplifier. The Q&amp;A session was exceptionally insightful, not only solving students&rsquo; specific problems in areas like taxation, retirement planning, and asset allocation but also providing profound inspiration regarding investment mindset, communication wisdom, and information discernment. This was a comprehensive sharing that covered everything from the Tao (investment philosophy) to the techniques (specific strategies) and the tools (learning instruments).</p>

      <description>In this session, James delves into the core philosophy of long-term investing, emphasizing that investors should adopt a &amp;#39;do nothing&amp;#39; mindset, ignoring short-term market fluctuations, macroeconomic data, and various news noise. He points out that the key to success lies in proper risk management—namely, using rational asset allocation and sufficient cash reserves to cope with market uncertainty, rather than trying to predict the market. The course also analyzes the difficulties of value investing, the currency dilemmas of emerging markets, and answers student questions on practical topics such as geographic arbitrage, family financial communication, and the rate of return on insurance products.</description>

<p>This session revolves around the core concept of long-term investing—a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; approach. James emphasizes that investors should ignore short-term market fluctuations, macroeconomic data, financial reports, and even political news, and instead, stick to buying and holding high-quality assets (like QQQ) for the long term. The key to success is not in predicting market highs and lows, but in proper risk management, which means using sensible asset allocation and maintaining sufficient cash reserves to handle any market condition. The market has no peak; it will only go higher. Investors should focus on the future 20 years from now, rather than worrying about tomorrow&rsquo;s ups and downs.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Do Nothing&rdquo; Approach</strong>: The best investment strategy is to buy and then leave it alone; the market will naturally reach new highs. Trying to manage or predict the market is more likely to lead to failure.</li>
<li><strong>Ignore Market Noise</strong>: Investors don&rsquo;t need to care about what Trump or Putin says, nor should they pay attention to economic data like PPI and CPI or company earnings reports. This short-term information is irrelevant to long-term investing.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Time</strong>: Investing requires a long-term view, at least a 20-year horizon. Thinking about the person you want to become in 20 years is more meaningful than worrying about tomorrow&rsquo;s market. Getting rich overnight is impossible, but going bankrupt overnight is common, which is why risk control is crucial.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: The only way to face market volatility is through proper asset allocation and having enough cash, not by trying to predict the market.</li>
<li><strong>Investing with Loans</strong>: Whether it&rsquo;s a personal loan or a mortgage, you must ensure you can repay it with your salary. For retirees with no income, taking out a wealth management mortgage is not recommended; a reverse mortgage could be considered to increase cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging</strong>: When pledging stocks, you must also understand asset allocation and keep enough cash on hand to deal with market fluctuations, avoiding a margin call due to a market downturn.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limitations of Currencies</strong>: The domestic currencies of emerging countries (like the New Taiwan Dollar) are not internationally circulated and cannot be directly converted into US dollars.</li>
<li><strong>Sources of Foreign Exchange Reserves</strong>: A country&rsquo;s foreign exchange reserves mainly come from two channels:
<ol>
<li><strong>Current Account</strong>: Earning foreign currency by exporting goods and services, such as TSMC&rsquo;s export revenues. These are called &ldquo;slave dollars&rdquo; because a great deal of labor is required to earn them.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Account</strong>: Inflow of foreign capital for investment (e.g., buying stocks). This capital can come and go quickly, easily causing financial turmoil and leading to national bankruptcy.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Bankruptcy</strong>: When a country&rsquo;s export capability is weak and it relies heavily on foreign capital from the financial account, it faces a financial crisis or even national bankruptcy if that foreign capital withdraws on a large scale and its foreign reserves are insufficient to cope.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Difficulty of Valuation</strong>: Valuing an asset (whether a house or a stock) is extremely difficult and subjective. Like the Mona Lisa&rsquo;s smile, different people have different interpretations, and there is no standard answer.</li>
<li><strong>The Fallacy of Valuation</strong>: Many people claim stocks are too expensive, yet the market continues to rise. Munger once said he never saw Buffett pick up a pen to calculate a discounted cash flow. Therefore, don&rsquo;t be troubled by claims of &ldquo;overvaluation.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Holding is the Only Solution</strong>: Forgetting about valuation and holding high-quality assets for the long term is the most effective investment strategy that everyone can execute.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reject Blind Imitation</strong>: Do not copy someone else&rsquo;s asset allocation plan. Everyone&rsquo;s plan is tailored to their age, asset size, risk tolerance, and financial goals (like retiring in 5 or 10 years). Learn the core spirit and logic of asset allocation, rather than mimicking specific percentages like a parrot.</li>
<li><strong>Account Advice for U.S. Investors</strong>: For investors in the United States, full advantage should be taken of the tax benefits of a Roth IRA account. It is an excellent tool for tax avoidance and inheritance. It is recommended to allocate at least one-third of your funds to a Roth account, which is particularly suitable for holding leveraged funds.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Right Investment</strong>: As long as it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;right investment&rdquo; (like QQQ) combined with &ldquo;long-term holding,&rdquo; you will definitely make a profit.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunity Cost is a Real Loss</strong>: Short-term paper losses are temporary and non-existent. However, the gains you miss out on due to hesitation (the money you could have earned) are a permanent and tangible loss.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If QQQ rises from 400 to 577, and you didn&rsquo;t buy at 400, you have permanently lost that 177 in profit. This loss can never be recovered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Act Immediately</strong>: Therefore, you should buy immediately when you have the money; this is the action with the highest expected value. The later you buy, the less you earn, the lower your wealth growth base becomes, and the wider the gap between you and others will grow.</li>

<li>Sharing: He recently read discussions about how AI will change the world, which made him feel that he shouldn&rsquo;t retire in the next 10 years. He feels he should work hard as this might be his last job opportunity, and he doesn&rsquo;t want to sell his growing QQQ for living expenses.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: The decision to work should not be based on fear of the future (like AI replacing jobs). You should ask yourself: Do you like your job? Are you working for money or for happiness? This is the fundamental reason that should determine whether you continue to work, regardless of the AI era or a future space age.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: He recently saw online discussions about &ldquo;geographic arbitrage,&rdquo; which involves moving to Southeast Asian countries with lower living costs (like Thailand or Vietnam) to make savings last longer. He wants to ask if this approach is feasible and what the risks or recommendations are.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;arbitrage&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s &ldquo;having no way out.&rdquo; Moving to a place you don&rsquo;t genuinely like just to save money is a form of external diseconomy and is not advisable. We should strive to live in an environment we like and find convenient, not be forced into a choice because of a lack of money. If you move to Hualien or Taitung because they are beautiful, that&rsquo;s the right choice even if it costs more than Taipei. But if it&rsquo;s just to save money, it&rsquo;s the wrong choice.</li>

<li>Sharing: He shared his understanding of &ldquo;happiness.&rdquo; In the past, his happiness came from external recognition like good grades or promotions. After learning James&rsquo;s financial concepts, he believes true happiness is simple, like seeing an old couple quietly eating an apple at the foot of Mount Fuji. At that moment, past achievements no longer mattered.</li>
<li>Question: He understands Adler&rsquo;s principle of &ldquo;separation of tasks,&rdquo; but he still feels sad when he sees friends and family struggling in the cycle of hard work. He knows he can&rsquo;t force them to change, but he wants to ask how to adjust this feeling of &ldquo;not being able to bear it.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: My view of happiness is &ldquo;whatever, it&rsquo;s all good, it doesn&rsquo;t matter&rdquo;—that is, happiness is having no burdens. The situation you described is much like a doctor&rsquo;s dilemma: seeing a patient who can&rsquo;t afford a necessary stent, the doctor is helpless. Poverty is a disease, and we can&rsquo;t save everyone; even the thousand-armed Guanyin has limits. What you can do is tell them the correct concept once, fulfilling your responsibility. Those who believe will be saved. For those who don&rsquo;t, you must learn to let go, or you won&rsquo;t be able to live your own life well.</li>

<li>Question: While listening to Howard Marks&rsquo;s audiobook, he understood that market cycles don&rsquo;t have a fixed length but are driven by the collective sentiment of the masses. When the market is extremely euphoric, it&rsquo;s a bubble, and vice versa. Is this understanding correct?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Your understanding is completely correct. The only indicator of a bubble, as Howard Marks says, is that &ldquo;investors have gone crazy&rdquo;; there are no other quantitative metrics. But the difficulty with this theory is in its execution. Everyone is in a different environment and has a different perception of the market&rsquo;s &ldquo;temperature,&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s very hard to pinpoint the peak.

<li>Sharing: She introduced James&rsquo;s investment philosophy to a very conservative elder, who ultimately only agreed to invest NT$20,000 per month into 006208 (a Taiwanese ETF) on a regular basis. She feels a bit anxious about this, thinking it&rsquo;s too slow.</li>
<li>Question: This elder insists they have an insurance policy bought 30-40 years ago with an 8% return. She suspects this was just a sales pitch from the agent back then and wants to ask how to explain to the elder that the actual return on this policy is likely not that high.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: First, don&rsquo;t be anxious. If the person involved isn&rsquo;t in a hurry, we shouldn&rsquo;t be either. You don&rsquo;t know if your advice will save them or harm them. What if they invest and the market drops in the short term? They will blame you. Taking it slow is a good thing. Regarding the insurance policy, an 8% return is almost impossible. You need to calculate the actual annualized rate of return (IRR or XIRR), not a simple arithmetic average. Especially considering the funds invested early on were locked up for 20-30 years with no return, the opportunity cost during that period is enormous. A rough estimate shows that if the same money (NT$750,000 invested annually for 20 years) were put into the market (at a 10% annualized return), it would become NT$100 million after 28 years. The policy, however, only pays out NT$1 million per year, making the return not even 1%. It&rsquo;s essentially a product from a &ldquo;scam group.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Sharing: A follow-up on family financial communication. He realized that for large investments (like consolidating a mortgage to free up several million), he must get his wife&rsquo;s consent. His current strategy is &ldquo;slowly might be faster,&rdquo; gradually gaining his wife&rsquo;s understanding and trust through continuous communication, sharing small gains, and explaining the long-term philosophy. He believes it&rsquo;s very important for a couple to be on the same page; otherwise, even if he makes money from investments, it could cause family conflicts.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Your approach is absolutely correct. Take it slow, and make sure your spouse feels involved and secure. For example, you can put a portion of the money from the loan into your wife&rsquo;s account for her to manage. When she sees cash in the account, she will feel more at ease. Never make decisions on your own. Even if you succeed, your partner might get angry for not being respected, which could lead to a broken marriage.</li>

<li>Question: James mentioned that one of the three principles of asset allocation is to consider the extreme scenario of &ldquo;interest rates rising to infinity.&rdquo; He is worried that if a situation like the 1980s in the U.S. occurs, with interest rates as high as 20%, our current backtesting models based on the last 20 years of data might not hold up. Is he worrying too much?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This is an excellent question. The way to deal with such an extreme situation is to hold more cash. If you are worried about a &ldquo;stagflation&rdquo; environment like the 1970s-1980s, where the stock market stagnated and interest rates were high, then your initial cash allocation should be higher, for example, increasing it from 30% to 40% or even 50%. Your cash reserve determines how much risk you can withstand.</li>

<li>Question: When he tries to &ldquo;awaken&rdquo; people around him, he finds two outcomes: one type awakens and starts taking action; the other type realizes they&rsquo;ve been wrong for decades and feels pain and despair. He doesn&rsquo;t know how to help the latter group and worries that awakening them without proper guidance might end up harming them.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: You are right about the &ldquo;systemic scam.&rdquo; Simply &ldquo;awakening&rdquo; someone is very dangerous because they might try to figure things out on their own and end up on the wrong path (like day trading), leading to bankruptcy.

<li>Question: A friend asked her: &ldquo;You early investors bought QQQ at a low price, and now you encourage us to buy, pushing the price up. What benefit do you get?&rdquo; She replied that the market is huge, we can&rsquo;t influence the price, and the price increase comes from productivity growth and inflation. She wants to know how James would respond.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: When you buy in doesn&rsquo;t matter. The long-term annualized return of the market (say, over 30-40 years) is relatively constant. The rate of return I have gotten over the past 40 years and the rate of return you will get by investing for the next 40 years have the same expected value. Us encouraging you to buy doesn&rsquo;t make us more money. Everyone&rsquo;s investment is an independent event. The return you get is only related to how long you hold, it has nothing to do with us.</li>

<li><strong>On Overseas Brokers (like Futu)</strong>: James strongly advises Taiwanese investors against using overseas brokers like Futu. The main risks are: 1. Issues with the Alternative Minimum Tax. 2. High estate taxes (potentially up to 40%). 3. If the investor has an accident, their heirs may not even find this account, and the inheritance process will be extremely difficult.</li>
<li><strong>On Exchange Rates</strong>: Investing is a decades-long endeavor; don&rsquo;t pay attention to short-term currency fluctuations. In the long run, exchange rates will fluctuate within a range and eventually converge to an expected value. Worrying about exchange rates will prevent you from doing anything.</li>
<li><strong>On the Cash Portion</strong>: The &ldquo;cash&rdquo; portion of asset allocation should absolutely not be invested in high-dividend stocks. High-dividend stocks are still stocks, they will fall, and they do not have the stability of cash. Cash should be allocated to truly safe assets like a Money Market Fund or short-term government bonds.</li>
<li><strong>On Other Funds</strong>: A student asked about actively managed funds like the Franklin Technology Fund. James&rsquo;s advice is to stop investing in such funds with high fees and potential redemption restrictions, and just buy 00662 (Taiwan&rsquo;s Nasdaq ETF) directly.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The market has no peak, it will only go higher.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: At the beginning of the session, James emphasized the long-term conviction investors should have, and not to feel fear or try to predict the top just because the market is making new highs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The money you miss out on earning is a permanent loss for your entire life&hellip; Earning less is a tangible loss.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When explaining why one should &ldquo;buy immediately with available cash,&rdquo; James pointed out that opportunity cost is a real and permanent loss, far more terrifying than short-term paper losses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You could have billions and not be able to spend it all, yet you&rsquo;re thinking of moving to a backward place&hellip; (just to save money) that&rsquo;s called having no way out.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When commenting on &ldquo;geographic arbitrage,&rdquo; James sharply pointed out that sacrificing quality of life and moving to an undesirable, cheap area due to financial constraints is not a wise move.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seeing others suffer, it&rsquo;s hard for us to save them&hellip; It&rsquo;s like Jesus, he spoke to someone&hellip; but then the person ran away because they didn&rsquo;t have enough money&hellip; and Jesus had to let go, there was nothing he could do.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: In answering Edwin&rsquo;s question on how to adjust his mindset when facing friends and family he can&rsquo;t help, James used this analogy to explain that all we can do is pass on the information. Whether the other person accepts it is beyond our control, and we must learn to let go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slowly might be faster.
&ndash; Jason</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Jason summarized this philosophical phrase when sharing his experience communicating investment concepts with his family, emphasizing the importance of patience and continuous communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a husband and wife are of one mind, they can break through metal. If they are not&hellip; even if you succeed, she might fly into a rage, &lsquo;You do everything without telling me.&rsquo;
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When commenting on family financial communication, James stressed the extreme importance of spousal consensus, otherwise even successful investments could destroy the family relationship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I said your [insurance policy] doesn&rsquo;t even pay out when it should, and he said, &lsquo;how much premium did you pay?&rsquo;&hellip; Wow, is that what you call insurance?
&ndash; James
Background: Recalling a debate with an insurance professional, James revealed the nature of some insurance products where the &ldquo;payout limit is tied to the premium paid,&rdquo; pointing out the limitations of their protective function.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take that fifteen million to buy insurance, you could have a hundred million&hellip; you only get one million a year&hellip; that&rsquo;s just taking one percent, and you&rsquo;re still smiling happily about it.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Through calculation, James revealed the extremely low rate of return on long-term savings insurance. Compared to investing in the market over the same period, the difference in returns is immense, representing a huge opportunity cost loss.</p>

</h2>
<p>This session once again reinforced the core idea of CLEC&rsquo;s long-term investing: simplify investment decisions and embrace the market&rsquo;s long-term growth. Through the concept of a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; approach, James urged investors to break free from the interference of short-term market noise and to focus on building a robust, personalized asset allocation, always maintaining sufficient cash as the ultimate defense against risk. The Q&amp;A session covered multiple dimensions, from personal mindset adjustments and family financial communication to the analysis of financial products like insurance. Using vivid examples and sharp insights, James exposed many common investment fallacies. The most central takeaway is that investing is a marathon of patience and discipline; taking immediate action and persisting for the long term is far more important than trying to find the perfect timing and valuation.</p>
