<p>This episode primarily shares the power of compound interest in long-term investing and discusses whether the 80/20 asset allocation strategy for retirees can be used for collateralization. James uses specific examples and data analysis to emphasize the importance of compound interest in long-term investing and the key issues to consider when using the 80/20 asset allocation for collateralization. For example, while it&rsquo;s possible for retirees to use the 80/20 allocation for collateral, there are many restrictions. For safety, retirees should stick to the 433 allocation for collateralization.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learning Materials</strong>: Newcomers are advised to watch <strong>video 00451</strong> first. We have also compiled a playlist of short videos. The subtitles for the &ldquo;<strong>One Hundred Million Yuan Investment Lecture</strong>&rdquo; series have been re-proofread, including English and various global language versions, making the translation more accurate.</li>
<li><strong>Viewing Recommendations</strong>: James advises everyone to watch the entire video, as the amount of information is large. Asking questions based on watching only parts of the video makes it difficult to get complete and comprehensive answers.</li>
<li><strong>About Groups</strong>: CLEC does not have any groups. The existing groups are organized by enthusiastic students, like the &ldquo;00662&rdquo; group. These groups mainly help new friends answer basic investment questions. However, it&rsquo;s important to note that these groups are not affiliated with CLEC, and James does not participate in any groups.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Usable Funds Ratio for Collateralized Borrowing</strong>: The annual available funds for collateralized borrowing are 2% of retirement reserves (assuming your retirement reserves are 50 times your annual expenses). If your retirement reserves are NT$30 million, the annual available funds are NT$600,000 (NT$30 million * 2% = NT$600,000). This NT$600,000 is fixed. Even if the NT$30 million becomes NT$20 million due to market fluctuations, you can still use NT$600,000. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about a decrease in available funds because of market drop.</li>
<li><strong>Spending Strategy During Market Downturns</strong>: You do not need to reduce spending during a market downturn. You can increase spending during a market upswing. In other words, our annual spending will only increase, not decrease.</li>
<li><strong>Spending Adjustment Strategies</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Upswing Scenario</strong>: For example, with a retirement reserve of NT$30 million, after 5 years, assets increase from NT$30 million to NT$50 million, and the net assets (after deducting debt, including 5 years of expenses, and annual interest, totaling NT$3.22 million) are NT$46.78 million (NT$50 million - NT$3.22 million = NT$46.78 million). At this point, annual available funds can be adjusted to NT$930,000 (NT$46.78 million * 2% = NT$930,000). However, this NT$930,000 includes interest expenses. Assuming the previous loan of NT$3.22 million and a 3% interest rate, the annual interest expense is about NT$100,000, and the actual available funds are NT$830,000 (NT$930,000 - NT$100,000 = NT$830,000).</li>
<li><strong>Downturn Scenario</strong>: There is no need to reduce spending during a market downturn. You can still maintain the peak spending level (e.g., if the peak spending was NT$900,000, you can still maintain NT$900,000 per year even if assets drop to NT$30 million). This allocation strategy is based on a model that assumes a 10-year decline from the peak, which can be fully sustained even under the extreme scenario of a 10-year decline.</li>
<li><strong>Core Principle for Spending Adjustments</strong>: Only increase spending, not decrease it, and it&rsquo;s recommended to adjust it every 5 years to avoid frequent adjustments.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Retirees who do not utilize collateralization can use an 80/20 asset allocation, i.e., 80% invested in QQQ and 20% in cash.</strong></li>
<li><strong>An 80/20 asset allocation, without collateralization, allows for simple rebalancing yearly without risk of bankruptcy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you must utilize the 80/20 asset allocation for collateralization, please be aware:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Absolutely do not use cash to rebalance in the market, cash must only increase, not decrease.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Market downturns may last up to 10 years. If you borrow 2% annually, you will borrow more than 20% in 10 years. If you then invest cash, your total assets may be less than 20%. Therefore, using an 80/20 asset allocation for collateralization is high risk.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A safer approach is still a 433 allocation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you must use the 80/20 allocation for collateralization, rebalancing intelligently only during upswing years, that is, can only transfer cash from the prototype fund (QQQ), it is not allowed to transfer cash into QQQ during downswing years, can transfer cash into QQQ during upswing years.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This approach is complex and requires simulation to ensure feasibility.</strong></li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Whenever making an asset allocation or adjustment, assume that it&rsquo;s the market&rsquo;s highest point.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Spending does not need to be reduced during a 10-year decline, as the allocation strategy has been verified through simulations as feasible.</strong></li>
<li>When assets have risen to a new high (e.g., from NT$30 million to NT$45 million), you can reset the spending amount. Even if the market declines again afterwards, you don&rsquo;t need to reduce spending because it is already close to the bottom, and risk is reduced.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>When the Traditional IRA becomes an inheritance, the heir must withdraw all the funds within 10 years. The principal and appreciation are both taxed, and there are almost no inheritance tax exemptions.</strong></li>
<li><strong>When the Roth IRA becomes an inheritance, the heir has 10 years to withdraw the funds, and neither the principal nor the appreciation is taxed.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Converting Traditional IRA to Roth IRA as soon as possible can effectively reduce the tax burden when RMD (Required Minimum Distribution) occurs.</strong></li>
<li>Many financial planners or accountants do not advise converting all your Traditional IRA to Roth IRA at once because they want to minimize your current year&rsquo;s taxes, rather than focusing on long-term tax planning.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Angel is a young man currently studying in the United States. He turns 21 the next day. His parents are very supportive and hardworking, allowing Angel to study in the U.S. without worry. Angel&rsquo;s parents hope he can live a wealthy life, so they advised him to learn investment and financial management with James and promised to give him funds to invest.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: If James were 21 again, with his current knowledge and parental support, how would he invest?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: If James were 21 again with his current knowledge and parental support, he would use a 442 allocation to buy in all at once. Additionally, the teacher shared two investment mistakes he made when he was young: investing in real estate, which he bought for 8 million and sold for only 6 million after 10 years, resulting in a significant loss; and selling company stock to buy a car. These two poor decisions resulted in his assets being reduced by half. The teacher used his own example to emphasize: <strong>$100,000 for a young person, with time, compounded at 14% annually, will be $25 million in 60 years; $10,000 for a young person is $2.6 million in the future, so young people should learn to save and invest first and then learn to spend money when the time is right.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Besides human nature, why is it not advisable for someone of my age to put all my money into QQQ, but rather 433 or 442?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Human nature is the most important factor that must be considered in investment. You cannot exclude the factor of &ldquo;human nature&rdquo;. If you don&rsquo;t consider human nature, then don&rsquo;t invest. For example, investors often overestimate their risk tolerance. Investment should avoid getting yourself into a state of extreme panic. Allocating all your assets to QQQ or half in QQQ and half in cash overestimates your risk tolerance. Although the market will eventually go up in the long term, your assets may fall to extremely low values during a market downswing, for example: from 100 to 80, 70, 60, then finally falling down to 5, 1. During this process, you might have already gone bankrupt and exited, even if you survive until market rise, it no longer has anything to do with you. It’s like playing Russian roulette: a revolver with 6 chambers, and 1 bullet. If the person firing doesn’t die, they will get 10 million; if they do die, they die. You should not participate because of the high reward. You could die. So young people&rsquo;s beta should not exceed 1.2.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: Has retired and currently uses a power account as a reserve for daily living. The account balance is usually 0. Money is only used when a large expense happens or an emergency occurs. This practice brings her peace of mind. She doesn&rsquo;t need to keep a lot of cash in her daily account so that she could effectively use cash for investment purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: After retiring, I do not want to use leveraged funds (like QLD), but I am worried about a stock market crash. Is it feasible to use the 80/20 (80% in QQQ and 20% in cash) asset allocation strategy?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Yes, it is feasible. An 80/20 asset allocation, if you don&rsquo;t do collateralization, can do simple rebalancing yearly. Because she is retired, and the funds in her collateralization account have not been used, which is equivalent to her not using collateralization, she can use the 80/20 asset allocation strategy under that circumstance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: Has started Roth IRA conversion and plans to complete all the conversion within the next few years when the tax rate is lower.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Some people suggested using up the 32% tax rate, but I cannot mentally accept it, as it may mean paying higher taxes. Is it okay to just use up the 24% tax rate and deal with the rest during RMD time?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: You can complete all the conversions before the RMD age, as long as you finish before RMD, as money cannot be transferred into a Roth IRA after RMD age. Money can only be transferred into a brokerage account, which is not beneficial to inheritance. It is recommended to transfer the funds from the retirement account to a Roth IRA as much as possible, as the Roth IRA&rsquo;s heir does not need to pay taxes within 10 years, while the Traditional IRA&rsquo;s heir needs to pay taxes. Converting early can avoid higher taxes in the future. If you still do the conversion when the market drops, it means your conversion decision is correct. Although you may have to pay as high as 30% tax now during conversion, you can avoid higher taxes in the future in the long run (because your assets will grow significantly over time, so you will have to pay more taxes later).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: YJ would first like to thank James and the &ldquo;00662&rdquo; group, especially for Chen Feng&rsquo;s sharing and James&rsquo;s supplementation, which make everyone&rsquo;s investment concepts clearer.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: The Chinese concept of &ldquo;having land is having wealth&rdquo; needs to be updated. In the current era, this &ldquo;land&rdquo; should not be real estate but rather &ldquo;stocks&rdquo;. The old concept of &ldquo;having land is having wealth&rdquo; refers to farmland that can be cultivated and has output, which is similar concept to current day investing in stocks.</li>
<li><strong>Suggestion</strong>: There are no more lectures on the 100 Million Investment topic this year. The 9 situations in the 00005 topic have been simplified into 2 situations. Can there be a &ldquo;00006&rdquo; topic, specifically on the &ldquo;collateralization&rdquo; part, with a simpler presentation?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: &ldquo;Having land is having wealth&rdquo; did not refer to houses in the past, as houses were not valuable in those eras and this term referred to farmlands. Today&rsquo;s &ldquo;having land is having wealth&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;having stocks is having wealth&rdquo;, stocks are the true assets. Regarding your suggestion of topic 00006, James believes the existing sharing is already simplified enough. Users using collateralization should use the 433 allocation and make &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; using 2% of their assets yearly, and there is no need for a more complicated topical presentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: Previously, I sent a message on YouTube mentioning the video 00303 in March 2022, and you suggested to not use TQ (TQQQ) back then. However, two months ago (around November), you replied that a 6TQQ+2U+2Cash strategy can be used with a 6:2:2 allocation. Does this strategy and comparison with the 442 strategy feasible?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: TQQ can be used. The suggestion in previous videos was based on the understanding at the time, so single-asset investment in TQQ was not recommended. However, now, if you have an asset allocation (like 6:2:2, which is 60% in TQQ, 20% in U, and 20% in Cash) and do &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo;, this strategy is viable. Investment strategies and concepts are constantly evolving and improving. Ideas considered impossible in the past may now be proven to be feasible.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: I previously learned about BOXX as an investment target that is not correlated to the stock market. However, I learned that it&rsquo;s related to blockchain, so there are concerns about its safety, and whether its risk is too high?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: BOXX&rsquo;s operating mechanism is similar to 00864B. As long as its return is trending similarly to the US Federal Funds Rate, its risk is controllable. You should pay serious attention when the return is much higher or lower than the US Federal Funds Rate, as it may indicate some irregular financial operations. BOXX&rsquo;s primary function is to reasonably avoid investment income tax, and it can be used as a short-term investment target.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: I am retired and have benefited from this investment method. I want to recommend this investment method to my younger sister in China (who is 50 years old, runs a small business, has a tight budget, and has almost no knowledge of investment). Should I give her investment advice?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Yes, you should. You can be her benefactor. However, she may not accept advice directly. Furthermore, opening an account and the follow-up operations are complex. So, if you really want to help her, you can open an account for her first and invest a small amount of money (such as $1,000 USD for about ¥7,000 to ¥8,000 RMB), tell her that if there are losses, you will bear it, if there are profits, it&rsquo;s hers. You can also co-invest with her proportionally, for example, if she invests ¥100, you can invest ¥100 for her. Once she sees a return, she will then invest automatically.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: IAM has recently met a doctor in his 70s. When he was young in his 30s, he trusted brokers and made careless investments. After several failed investments, he not only had real estate and stocks but was also in debt at 40 years old. He had to work to repay his debts even in his 70s. IAM is very grateful he found CLEC in 2022 and avoided going down the same path as the doctor.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: James often says &ldquo;slow is fast,&rdquo; and investment should not be rushed. However, everyone&rsquo;s understanding of &ldquo;fast&rdquo; and &ldquo;slow&rdquo; is different. Can you please explain how to measure &ldquo;fast&rdquo; and &ldquo;slow&rdquo; in investing and how to view the concept of &ldquo;40 years is too long&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Everything has its own rules and timings, like pregnancy and childbirth, which takes ten months and cannot be shortened. The same applies to investing. Wealth growth takes time. You cannot expect to harvest tomorrow what you planted today. It takes 10 years of investment to feel wealthy, 20 years to retire, 30 years to be prosperous, and 40 years to become rich. This requires time, one cannot be hasty. Warren Buffett did not become the world&rsquo;s richest man at 30 or 40, but after 55 years old. Investing requires understanding the essence and rules of time. Do not be impatient. Every thing operates following its rules and timings. It&rsquo;s a rule of nature and cannot be rushed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Why do people haggle over small amounts of money, but at the same time act recklessly like gamblers when it comes to investing?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: This all stems from humanity&rsquo;s &ldquo;loss aversion&rdquo; mentality. People do not like to lose, so they haggle over prices when shopping, but they tend to focus only on the gains and ignore the risks when investing. During investment, people often forget past losses and only think about making more money in the future. This is the gambler&rsquo;s mentality. When shopping, people compare prices since they can lose less and, by nature, they will haggle. In investing, people think that the more they invest, the more they will earn; while ignoring the possibility of losses, hence they will not haggle. It&rsquo;s like if you go to buy a cake, and the owner says the cake is 100, you might haggle and say can it be 90? But if the owner says you buy my cake and tomorrow I&rsquo;ll return 300, you won&rsquo;t haggle anymore, you&rsquo;d think the more expensive, the better.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: Shared a story about a CNBC interview with Buffett and Bill Gates: If Buffett and Bill Gates went to McDonald&rsquo;s and they see 1 cent on the ground, what would they do? Buffett would pick it up without hesitation and check if there are any other coins around; and Bill Gates would also pick up that cent. This story illustrates the principles of &ldquo;every little bit counts&rdquo; and &ldquo;compound interest.&rdquo; Even the wealthy do not overlook the importance of &ldquo;saving&rdquo; because when Mike was on a business trip to Microsoft in 1992, Microsoft was already a listed company, and Bill Gates was already very wealthy at that time. One of the employees criticized Bill Gates for using coupons when shopping for groceries. Later, one time, Bill Gates was looking for his coupon when checking out. The person behind him said, don&rsquo;t worry, I will pay, you earn more than this in one minute. However, Bill Gates did not ignore the person behind him, he continued to search for his coupon.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: Opinions regarding Deep Seek: Recently, AI technology is developing rapidly, with various new technologies and applications emerging, including Deep Seek, which will have a significant impact on QQQ&rsquo;s future. Currently, American technology giants seem to have a &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; mentality, believing that they can win the AI race as long as they invest enough resources. However, historical experience shows that technological leadership does not necessarily win the market, the business model is also important.</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>:</li>
<li>Deep Seek, like many other AI technologies, is still in the early stages, and there will be many uncertainties in the future. But what is certain is that AI will have a profound impact on human society and bring huge opportunities for investors.</li>
<li>Regarding the competition between the US and China in the field of AI, it is still difficult to judge who will ultimately win. The US has advantages in technology and funds, but China also has its own advantages, such as large amounts of data and government support.</li>
<li>AI is not only large language models (LLM), there are many other applications, for example: Tesla&rsquo;s autonomous driving. Tesla&rsquo;s autonomous driving model is already very mature, it can automatically drive out from the parking lot and the driving experience is very smooth, just like a professional driver is driving for you.</li>
<li>AI will not completely replace human jobs but increase our work efficiency. For example, even for translators, you can use AI to improve the efficiency and quality of translation. Therefore, humans need to learn how to utilize AI, not reject it.</li>
<li>Currently, the biggest problem is that many large companies want to introduce AI, but they do not have a clear idea, they do not know whether it needs to be from top down or from bottom-up. James thinks it needs to be from bottom-up, the employees should use them first, so they are accustomed before moving up. But this requires time and because everyone is changing the thinking process of using AI.</li>
<li>AI will cause QQQ&rsquo;s annual returns to be much higher than 14%, or even 20% or 30%. James is very optimistic about this.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Event 1</strong>: Shared two experiences of encountering potential &ldquo;scams&rdquo;. One time was meeting someone on a highway who claimed to be from Dubai, needing help. This person was dressed neatly, drove a BMW, and claimed to have run out of gas and had no money or was robbed. This person wore gold and asked Hao Qing for help, claiming that he could give his gold to Hao Qing. Hao Qing gave him 40 yuan, but he wanted more. Hao Qing felt that something was wrong, and so did not give any more. The second time, he encountered the same person on the road again, so he called the police.</li>
<li><strong>Event 2</strong>: A colleague&rsquo;s relative, an 80-year-old, was scammed for 600,000 yuan. This old person did not believe what nearby people said about it being a scam, and believed that since he raised his children for so many years, it was not unfilial to ask them for money to invest and everyone was stopping him. When going to the bank, the bank employees also told him that it was a scam. The police also came to give him risk warnings that the money could not be transferred, but this old person still did not believe it and was scammed for 600,000 yuan.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Views</strong>: Hao Qing thinks that he is a kind-hearted person. When he sees someone in trouble, he will help to the best of his ability. However, he will be more careful when it comes to money. Also, there are now many scams and the success rate for solving them is extremely low. He is not sure if it&rsquo;s the government&rsquo;s problem or individual&rsquo;s problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: While discussing &ldquo;US-China trade&rdquo; with colleagues, his colleagues think that China may devalue the renminbi to deal with the US tariffs. He does not agree with this point of view but does not know how to explain it.</li>
<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How should we view the three problems of &ldquo;scams&rdquo;, &ldquo;Taiwan policy&rdquo;, and “RMB devaluation”?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>About Scams:</strong> The US does not care because the US thinks that if you are scammed, it means you are stupid. Furthermore, the person that Hao Qing encountered is technically not breaking a legal law, even if you report, it is useless. All the police can do is to chase him away. Why are there scams? It&rsquo;s because of &ldquo;poverty&rdquo;. When it&rsquo;s difficult to earn money through normal ways, &ldquo;scamming&rdquo; becomes a way to get rich quickly. So, you still need to start from the systems, and education aspect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>About Taiwan policies</strong>: The US has completely free capitalism where the market determines prices. When prices increase, wages increase, which will then increase interest rates and suppress inflation, ultimately creating a positive economic cycle. Taiwan&rsquo;s policies, to a certain degree, hinders this positive economic cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding the RMB devaluation expectations</strong>: This problem is complex and interlinked. It cannot be simply solved via devaluation.</li>

<p>When investing, you need to see results. You want to see results like Buffett&rsquo;s. Of course, everyone&rsquo;s level is different. When you feel you are living a prosperous life, you will also need 40 years. You cannot be hasty.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This point explains the importance of &ldquo;time&rdquo; and the power of &ldquo;compound interest&rdquo; in long-term investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value of life lies in learning, thinking, serving others, and growing, not just working and making money.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This point emphasizes that the meaning of life lies in continuous learning, growth, and serving society, not just the pursuit of material wealth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You also need an appropriate amount of time to grow wealth to a certain extent. Therefore, you need to recognize that time exists first.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This emphasizes that wealth accumulation requires time and patience, and one should not take any shortcuts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you do when everything is destroyed? You need a way out.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re investing or doing anything else, you have to consider if this thing fails, and whether you have a way out. Or whether you can bear the losses caused by that failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today if you buy a Tesla car but you&rsquo;re afraid of it getting scratched, you&rsquo;re afraid of washing it. After washing it, you&rsquo;re afraid to drive it. Every time you drive it out, you&rsquo;re afraid of people wanting to borrow it, or when your daughter wants to borrow it, you&rsquo;d always say no and no. You&rsquo;re a slave to wealth. It&rsquo;s okay to drive. I have insurance. If it is crashed I can buy a new one. This is wealth. Therefore, don&rsquo;t be a slave to your assets, never be.  It&rsquo;s better not to buy it, instead of buying it and then using up your mental energy over it. We should not spend any mental energy on material things. This is very important. This is the key to happiness.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>We should not be slaves to &ldquo;wealth,&rdquo; and should not be controlled by &ldquo;material things.&rdquo; If something affects your mood, do not buy it because you cannot afford it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People&rsquo;s destiny is controlled by three factors: The first is fate (DNA); the second is destiny (place of birth); and the third is luck.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>The place of birth determines destiny. If you are born in the United States, you have the American destiny; if you are born in Taiwan, you have the Taiwan destiny; if you are born in Australia, you have the Australian destiny.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am still going to tell everyone that we are going to be very wealthy, so when you want to immigrate you have to think twice. If it&rsquo;s me, I&rsquo;d rather spend 800,000 USD to immigrate to the US instead of using less money to immigrate to Canada, Europe, or the NSW. Because the destinies are different. Look at the world&rsquo;s top ten companies, and nine are from the US. Only one is TSMC from China, but TSMC is also cultivated in the US. To say it bluntly, all the world&rsquo;s top ten companies were founded by Americans, this is fate.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>When considering immigration, one should think not only for themselves but also the fate of future generations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An 80/20 allocation without collateralization can do simple rebalancing yearly without risk of bankruptcy.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Retirees that do not do collateralization may utilize an 80/20 asset allocation where 80% is invested in QQQ and 20% is kept in cash, and can do simple rebalancing without risk of bankruptcy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The US does not care about scams, they don&rsquo;t even care about the 0-dollar purchase scams, so why would they care about scams? Therefore, there is a cost accounting issue. If a country wants to be strong, it needs strong cost accounting. What do you want? Right and wrong is about competing, and everyone needs to know that prosperity is a key, and poverty is a disease. Being poor for an emerging country is a disease, if one is poor it&rsquo;s a disease.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>The United States is strong due to its sound system and market economy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Always maintain extreme optimism in investing and believe that the market will always go up.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Maintain an optimistic attitude throughout the investment process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI may not necessarily solely rely on computing power. It can also rely on the human brain.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This point explains that in the development of AI, in addition to computing power, the human brain can also play an important role.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market Volatility Is Irrelevant to Long-Term Investors</strong>: Short-term market fluctuations are normal. Long-term investors should adhere to the principle of &ldquo;buy when you have money, hold long term, and never sell,&rdquo; and not be swayed by market sentiment. Utilize the power of compound interest to hold quality assets for the long term. For example, even if the market experiences a significant pullback, as long as you hold a Nasdaq 100 index fund for the long term, you will ultimately achieve substantial returns.</li>

<li><strong>Investment Risk Warning</strong>: Investing involves risk, and the stock market is highly volatile. Investors should be fully aware of investment risks. For example, investing in stock index funds such as QQQ may face a short-term loss of 50% or even more of their market value.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investing Requires Continuous Learning</strong>: James emphasizes the importance of learning and encourages everyone to watch the value investing lecture series videos, recommending episodes 00451, 00398, and 00288. There are also condensed short films in the playlist to help everyone quickly grasp the core content and to share with friends and family. Only through continuous learning can we enhance our investment knowledge and judgment.</li>
<li><strong>Q&amp;A Only Refines Your Existing Knowledge, Not Establishes It</strong>: This means that the Q&amp;A session can only help you further understand what you have already learned, but cannot replace systematic study. For example, concerning how to specifically implement the 433 asset allocation strategy, you need to first watch relevant videos for a systematic understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Nasdaq 100 Index Funds</strong>: James recommends long-term investment in Nasdaq 100 index funds (such as QQQ and TQQQ) and provides a list of Nasdaq 100 index fund options around the world for investors in different regions to reference.</li>
<li><strong>Investor Optimism</strong>: Despite market fluctuations and uncertainties, investors should maintain an extremely optimistic mindset. Market declines should be seen as opportunities to buy quality assets at lower prices. In the long run, the economy and the stock market will always trend upwards.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth Growth Requires Time</strong>: Investing is a long-term process. Wealth growth needs time to realize the effects of compound interest. For example, by investing in a Nasdaq 100 index fund for the long term, waiting for ten or twenty years, assets could potentially grow to a scale of hundreds of millions.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of Long-Term Investing</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Compound Interest Effect</strong>: Long-term investing can fully utilize the effects of compound interest, achieving exponential growth of wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Emotional Trading</strong>: Long-term investing can avoid making poor investment decisions due to short-term market fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce Transaction Costs</strong>: Long-term investing can reduce the frequency of trading, thereby lowering transaction costs.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis of the US Balance Sheet</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Detailed Data</strong>: James provided detailed US balance sheet data, including:
<ul>
<li><strong>Total US Government and Private Borrowing</strong>: This refers to the total domestic debt of all forms in the United States.</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets</strong>: $202 trillion, representing the total value of all US assets.</li>
<li><strong>Deficit</strong>: $36 trillion, referring to the US government&rsquo;s fiscal deficit.</li>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities</strong>: $101 trillion, including the total debt of the government and the public, which is actually the amount of US currency issued.</li>
<li><strong>GDP</strong>: $28.57 trillion, representing the total value of all goods and services produced within the US in one year.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Tax Revenue</strong>: $12 trillion, referring to the US federal government&rsquo;s tax revenue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Income Estimation</strong>: Based on an average tax rate of 15%, it is estimated that the total income of US individuals and companies is about $80 trillion. James pointed out that because corporate tax rates are usually higher than 20%, this estimate may actually underestimate the actual income of the US, and the real number might be close to $100 trillion.</li>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Income Ratio</strong>: By comparing total liabilities to income, the US debt-to-income ratio was calculated and compared with individual debt-to-income ratios, explaining that the US balance sheet is very healthy and will not experience a debt crisis or bankruptcy as some people fear.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: The US was compared to an individual with $202 million worth of real estate, owing $100 million, and with an annual income of $80 million, illustrating that its financial situation is very healthy. In comparison, many people have an income far less than $80 million but carry huge mortgage debts, and their personal financial situation is much worse than that of the US.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Relationship Between the US Dollar and US Stocks</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Holding Assets, Not Currency</strong>: Investing in US index funds is actually holding a portfolio of assets composed of excellent US companies, rather than holding the US dollar as a currency.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of US Dollar Depreciation</strong>: Even if the US dollar depreciates, as long as the assets held (such as stocks) have value, the price of assets denominated in US dollars will rise.</li>
<li><strong>The US Dollar Is Just a Unit of Account</strong>: The US dollar is only a unit for measuring asset value and can be exchanged for assets using any other form of currency or valuable item. For example, real estate can be used to exchange for Apple shares or QQQ assets, without needing to go through the US dollar.</li>
<li><strong>US Dollar Credit Backing</strong>: The US dollar, as a fiat currency, is backed by national credit. The US government can repay its debt by taxing companies and individuals. Therefore, as long as US companies and individuals can continue to generate income, the US can repay its debts, and the US dollar will not collapse.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing Strategy</strong>: Since the US dollar may depreciate, it is advisable to borrow as much US dollars as possible to invest or consume. In the future, debt can be repaid using depreciated US dollars.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Refuting the Bankruptcy Theory</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Cited data and facts to refute the view that &ldquo;excessive US debt will lead to bankruptcy.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Emphasized that the US has vast assets and a continuous source of income, which is enough to repay its debts.</li>
<li>Pointed out that those who spread such statements may have ulterior motives, and investors should think independently and not blindly believe them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Holding of Quality Assets</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Emphasized the importance of long-term holding of high-quality US assets (such as the Nasdaq 100 index fund).</li>
<li>Even if the US dollar depreciates, the value of quality assets will continue to grow.</li>
<li>Example: If QQQ is currently $500, after a large US dollar depreciation, QQQ may rise to $10,000 because it represents the assets of 100 excellent US technology companies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>No Need to Worry About the US Dollar</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Investors should focus on the value of the assets themselves, rather than fluctuations in the US dollar.</li>
<li>US dollar depreciation is actually a good thing for investors holding quality assets because they can buy the same assets with fewer US dollars.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>433 Asset Allocation</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: The 433 asset allocation is an investment strategy that allocates 40% of total assets to QQQ (Nasdaq 100 index fund), 30% to TQQQ (3x leveraged Nasdaq 100 index fund), and 30% to cash or money market funds.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: By allocating assets with different risk levels, balance risk and return.</li>
<li><strong>Operation</strong>: Conduct &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; according to market conditions, that is, when the market rises, transfer some of the profits from TQQQ to cash; when the market falls, transfer cash to TQQQ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Smart Rebalancing</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanism</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>When the market rises</strong>: Convert some of the profits (usually 30%) from leveraged funds (such as TQQQ) into cash.</li>
<li><strong>When the market falls</strong>: Convert cash into leveraged funds in a certain proportion (usually 20% of the cash portion).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Effects</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>At market highs</strong>: The cash level is high, reducing the risk of a high-level pullback.</li>
<li><strong>At market lows</strong>: The cash level is low, allowing for buying more assets at lower prices, thus achieving greater returns when the market rebounds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Auto-Pilot</strong>: The smart rebalancing mechanism can automatically adjust asset allocation according to market conditions without manual intervention.</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: The internet bubble in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008 were used to illustrate how the 433 asset allocation and smart rebalancing mechanism protect investors&rsquo; assets during significant market volatility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Necessity of Long-Term Investment</strong>: Citing Howard Marks&rsquo;s views, it is explained that predicting short-term market trends is almost impossible, and frequent trading will only increase costs and risks. For ordinary investors, holding passive funds (such as QQQ) for the long term is a wiser choice.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Frequent Trading</strong>: Combining data on the losses of Taiwanese day traders, the risks and harms of short-term trading are explained.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Essence of the Financial Industry</strong>: The goal of the financial industry is to maximize its own interests and may &ldquo;empty&rdquo; investors&rsquo; pockets through various means. Investors must improve their financial literacy to recognize and resist the traps and temptations of the financial industry. For example, long-term bond products may appear stable in name, but still have the potential to lose 30% or more.</li>
<li><strong>Information Filter Bubble Effect</strong>: The development of the internet and social media makes it easier for people to access information that matches their own views, thus forming information filter bubbles and making it difficult to hear different opinions. This leads to biases in people&rsquo;s understanding of the world and even conflicting emotions.</li>
<li><strong>Australian 2x Leveraged Fund GNDQ</strong>: Introduced an Australian market 2x leveraged fund called GNDQ, for Australian investors to reference.</li>
<li><strong>International Situation and Investment</strong>: Although we may know nothing about the international situation, this does not affect our long-term investments. The important thing is to choose the right investment targets and stick to them for the long term.</li>
<li><strong>Allocation Strategies for Roth IRA and Traditional IRA</strong>: It is recommended to invest all the funds in Roth IRA in TQQQ to maximize tax-free returns. Traditional IRA can allocate a portion to cash and a portion to QQQ, with the specific ratio depending on individual circumstances.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Labor and Real Estate</strong>: Labor is facing the risk of unemployment, especially with the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Real estate also has risks, such as natural disasters and market volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of AI on the Future</strong>: The development of AI will have a huge impact on the job market, with a large number of jobs being replaced by AI. In the future, society may only be left with a small number of capitalists and people who can control AI, while others may become &ldquo;useless&rdquo; laborers. Therefore, one should no longer learn coding but should use AI to serve oneself.</li>
<li><strong>Predictions on Future High-Tech Returns</strong>: Some finance professionals predict that future high-tech returns will decrease. James refuted this view, believing that these predictions are baseless and pointed out that the investment performance of these predictors is also poor.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage Learning and Sharing</strong>: Encourage everyone to watch the short films of the investment lectures and share them with more people to help them build correct investment philosophies.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>:
<ol>
<li>The annualized return rate of long-term investment does not mean that fixed returns can be obtained every year. If the investment period is too short, the desired results may not be achieved due to market fluctuations. She cited a chart from a book called &ldquo;The Long View,&rdquo; which shows the highest and lowest returns for different investment periods. For example, investing for one year, the highest return might be 66%, but it could also result in a loss of 38%; investing for two years, the highest return is 39.4%, but it could also lead to a loss of 31.7%; investing for five years, the highest return is 27.3%, but it could also result in a loss of 11.9%. Only when the investment period is more than 20 years is it possible to obtain a return ranging from a minimum of 6% to a maximum of 17%. In summary, the longer the investment period, the more the return rate tends to approach the long-term average.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: The longer the investment period, the closer the return is to the average. For example, if you invest for 25 years, the return will increasingly approach 10%. This explains the significance of the 433 asset allocation: short-term cash needs can be met with the cash position, while long-term investment is not affected. For example, if an investment portfolio has 10 million in long-term investments and 1 million for school tuition, the 1 million can be combined with the 10 million for 433 allocation. This would mean 300,000 in cash, and even if the market declines, the 300,000 cash can cover tuition needs. It was also emphasized that stock pledging can further reduce risk, because low-interest funds can be borrowed to meet emergency needs.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: The company&rsquo;s 401K plan can deposit 30% of income, which is far more than the IRS limit. The extra funds are put into an after-tax account. If the principal of this part is transferred to Roth IRA, and the appreciated part is transferred to Regular IRA, are there any tax issues with such operations?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: The after-tax 401K plan you mentioned is actually a tax-deferred account, which allows investors to put their after-tax income into it and conduct tax-free trading, but still have to pay taxes when finally withdrawn. For short-term operators, this type of account can avoid tax liabilities caused by frequent trading. However, for long-term investors like us, we do not make frequent buying and selling transactions, so this type of account does not have much appeal to us. The disadvantage of participating in this plan is that it actually increases the size of your Traditional IRA, and we generally advise against having too large a Traditional IRA because you will have to pay income tax when you withdraw in the future. Therefore, I do not recommend that you continue to participate and put money into this after-tax 401K plan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: I am 60 years old, and my current asset allocation is 70% of my money in Traditional IRA, 10% in Roth IRA, and 15% in Regular IRA. How should I allocate my assets?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Given that your Roth IRA ratio is low, it is recommended to invest all the funds in your Roth IRA into TQQQ (3x leveraged Nasdaq 100 index fund) to maximize its potential for tax-free growth. For your Traditional IRA, it is recommended to allocate 20% to cash and 80% to QQQ (Nasdaq 100 index fund). This will make your overall asset allocation closer to the target of 433 (40% QQQ, 30% TQQQ, 30% cash).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: I am already using asset-backed loans, borrowing about 1% of the funds each year for use. According to the asset allocation ratio recommended by the teacher, my current cash ratio is insufficient. What should I do?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: In this case, you don&rsquo;t need to specifically increase your cash ratio. You only need to allocate 20% of the cash in your Traditional IRA and the remaining 80% to QQQ, and all the money in your Roth IRA to TQQQ. Use asset-backed loans to meet your daily expenses and tax payments, so that you do not need to use your investment principal. Continue to maintain the annual borrowing and use the loan to cover some expenses, so that your investment portfolio can continue to grow.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: The US government has a very complete retirement plan. In contrast, Taiwan has a big gap in guaranteeing its people&rsquo;s retirement. Taiwan&rsquo;s labor insurance retirement account requires employers to set aside 6% of employees&rsquo; salaries in accordance with the law, and employees can choose to self-allocate 0% to 6% of their salaries. When Ling first started working, there was only the 6% set aside by the employer. Later, following the advice of colleagues, she chose to self-allocate 6% to increase retirement savings and deduct income tax.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: There is no need to participate, because Taiwan&rsquo;s securities accounts are tax-free.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: After listening to James&rsquo;s concept of investing in QQQ in November last year, Ling decided to change the self-allocated portion to 0% and use all the funds for investing in QQQ. In addition, Ling&rsquo;s company provides two options, &ldquo;employee stock trust&rdquo; and &ldquo;employee savings trust,&rdquo; aimed at helping employees increase retirement funds. Previously, she did not know enough and chose the &ldquo;employee stock trust&rdquo; investing in company stocks, but the return in the past six years was only about 38%. If she had followed James&rsquo;s QQQ investment philosophy, the performance might be higher. Therefore, she has recently made adjustments and has chosen the &ldquo;employee savings trust&rdquo; starting this year. However, the investment targets of this &ldquo;employee savings trust&rdquo; are limited and cannot be directly invested in QQQ. Only funds can be chosen. Currently, Ling plans to invest the company&rsquo;s portion in US technology funds and the self-allocated portion in Taiwan stock funds. Although the monthly investment amount is not large, Ling believes it still needs to be further optimized.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Taiwan&rsquo;s securities accounts are tax-free, which is equivalent to the US Roth IRA, and there is no contribution limit, which is a very big advantage. Therefore, Taiwanese investors can directly use their own securities accounts for investments, especially in index funds such as QQQ, and do not need to participate in any retirement plans of the government or companies. These plans often have various restrictions, and the performance may not be good either. Taiwanese investors should take full advantage of this and invest funds directly into their securities accounts to enjoy tax-free investment income.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing 3</strong>: Since November last year, Ling has watched all of James&rsquo;s videos before 2024 and continues to learn from the following videos. Ling compares investing in QQQ to a &ldquo;big pool.&rdquo; As soon as funds become available, she immediately puts them in, and regards it as her &ldquo;real estate.&rdquo; This &ldquo;big pool&rdquo; will continue to grow over time and is safer than traditional real estate. There is no need to worry about risks such as earthquakes, windstorms, or floods. When money is needed, she borrows through asset pledging to obtain funds instead of selling assets.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Taiwan&rsquo;s financial environment is very friendly. In addition to tax-free securities accounts, the interest on asset-backed loans is also very low, which is an advantage that other regions cannot compare. Taiwanese investors should take full advantage of these &ldquo;free bullets&rdquo; and &ldquo;sophisticated weapons,&rdquo; do a good job in asset allocation, and the future wealth growth potential is huge. Regarding pledging, there is no need to wait until assets reach 10 million TWD to start. It can be decided based on your own circumstances and knowledge of assets. Even with only 2 million TWD of assets, you can try pledging to borrow a small amount of money each year (for example, 40,000 TWD) for use. As experience accumulates and assets grow, the borrowing amount can gradually be increased.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: He began learning James&rsquo;s investment courses in 2022 and created an investment discussion group on Line in Taiwan in 2023. He emphasized that this group is self-organized, has no affiliation with the CLEC official, and has not received authorization or any form of assistance from James. The original intention of creating this group was to find more like-minded people to discuss investments, especially about 00662 (Yuanta Baoshu Shenzhen) and James&rsquo;s investment philosophy. Currently, this group has developed into a learning community of more than 500 people.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: He mentioned that he is also facing a situation where his family does not understand his investment methods. For example, his father would question why he doesn&rsquo;t sell at high points but chooses to hold for the long term. In order to make his family better understand his investment philosophy, he invited his family to join the Line group he created, hoping that through the discussions within the group, his family could understand the advantages and value of long-term investment and reduce their concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 3</strong>: He particularly thanked several core members of the group, including Brother Chen, Mark, Chris, and QQM, for their contributions to the group&rsquo;s development.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 4</strong>: He revealed that Brother Chen in the group will be sharing his experiences from 2 PM to 7 PM tomorrow (January 19th) and provided a link for everyone to participate.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: James expressed support and encouragement for this kind of self-organized learning community, believing that this form can help more people learn and spread the correct investment philosophy. He also emphasized that he himself does not privately provide any special resources or guidance to anyone or any group. All sharing will be done on public platforms to ensure transparency and fairness of information. He also reminded everyone that although these self-organized groups are usually made with good intentions, they should be vigilant and pay attention to potential risks. He himself and CLEC will not be responsible for the operation and management of these groups.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He went hiking with a friend, who is also a member of CLEC. The two talked about the recent layoffs at Google due to AI development. This triggered their thinking about the future development of AI, especially whether AI will threaten humans due to its own &ldquo;rationality,&rdquo; for example, whether AI will deliberately leave bugs in its programs to avoid being shut down by humans.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What is the future development direction of AI? What impact will it have on human work? In particular, will AI develop self-awareness and threaten humans?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: The development of AI will have a huge impact on the job market. In the future, most people will face the risk of unemployment, and only a few capitalists and those who can control AI will be able to survive. Therefore, everyone should start learning and mastering AI tools now, and use them as assistants to improve work efficiency. At the same time, every country should pay attention to the development of AI, especially a comprehensive AI strategy. Currently, the United States and China are at the forefront in this area, while Europe and Taiwan are relatively lagging behind. If Taiwan wants to remain competitive in the AI era, it needs to significantly increase the salary levels of engineers and increase the TWD exchange rate to attract top talent from around the world. As for whether AI will develop self-awareness and threaten humans, this is indeed a concern. In the future, there may be a confrontation between &ldquo;righteous AI&rdquo; and &ldquo;villainous AI,&rdquo; just like in the movie &ldquo;The Matrix.&rdquo; This is also one of the reasons why Elon Musk is committed to developing more powerful AI and trying to guide it toward goodness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How does James view the practice of restricting certain countries from accessing certain advanced technologies (such as AI)? Is this a form of discrimination?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: This is a complex issue that can be discussed publicly, but it is necessary to avoid political stances and remain objective and rational. Efforts should be made to make information public and transparent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What is China&rsquo;s current asset situation? In addition, what impact does AI have on the stock markets of various countries?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Every country has its own problems. China&rsquo;s data is not completely transparent, and it is difficult to obtain accurate information. Currently, AI has the most significant impact on the stock markets of the United States and Taiwan, while other countries are relatively less affected.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: James previously suggested keeping cash in an IRA account rather than a Brokerage Account. Why is that?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Because the capital gains in the SEP IRA account also needs to be taxed, in order to avoid its rapid growth, it is recommended to keep your existing funds in your SEP IRA account as is and no longer contribute to it. The funds in the Brokerage Account can be used for asset-backed loans. You can continue to use the annual quota to deposit funds into your SEP IRA and then transfer it to a ROTH IRA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Do I need to keep some cash in my Brokerage Account?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: No, you do not. You can obtain emergency funds through asset-backed loans. For example, if you have $5 million in Brokerage Account assets, you can obtain a credit line of approximately $3.5 million, which is sufficient to deal with most emergencies. You can first apply to open the asset-backed loan function, even if you don&rsquo;t use it for the time being. When you need money, you can borrow from it at any time, for example, occasionally borrowing $100,000 to pay taxes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: You always emphasize that QQQ should &ldquo;never be sold.&rdquo; So should QLD or TQQQ in a Roth IRA account also &ldquo;never be sold?&rdquo; But doesn&rsquo;t TQQQ have various fees and losses?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Yes, even QLD and TQQQ should be held for the long term and not bought and sold frequently. Although TQQQ has some management fees and fluctuation losses, these losses are acceptable in the long term considering its huge growth potential. We should focus on long-term results rather than short-term fluctuations. For example, if QQQ increases 200 times in 40 years, then TQQQ may increase 600 times, which is a very substantial return.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 4</strong>: In a Roth IRA account, if I don’t buy QLD, can I buy TQQQ?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: I don’t give specific investment advice. Whether to buy TQQQ is your own choice. I can only tell you that the data we use for backtesting is based on QQQ. If you change the volatility, I will not be able to answer the questions you may encounter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 5</strong>: For a child&rsquo;s Roth IRA account, do you recommend buying QLD or QQQ?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: For children’s accounts, regardless of the account type, as long as the investment period is long enough, for example, 40 years, it is okay to consider investing in QLD as much as possible to maximize tax-free gains.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He used James&rsquo;s 433 asset allocation simulator to verify his investment logic and made adjustments according to his own circumstances. His current asset allocation is 80/20 (80% QQQ, 20% TQQQ). He plans to gradually transition to 40/30 (40% QQQ, 30% TQQQ, 30% cash) after retirement. He also shared his work experience in the AI field, mainly responsible for AI applications in power systems. He agrees with James&rsquo;s view that AI will eventually replace most human jobs, but some jobs are still difficult to replace in the short term, such as the construction industry. He also mentioned that the degree of demand for AI varies from region to region due to differences in labor costs. Finally, he shared that he would choose to stay in better hotels when he travels for business to enjoy life, rather than just saving money.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: In the process of market uptrend, your cash ratio must be greater than your liabilities. This is the most important principle. The 433 asset allocation has been verified by backtesting and can cope with the worst market conditions. If you cannot achieve the 433 allocation for the time being, you must at least ensure that the cash ratio is higher than your liabilities. At the same time, you can re-allocate your new capital each month. Regarding AI, although AI will eventually replace most jobs, some jobs are still difficult to replace in the short term. For example, the construction industry still requires a lot of physical labor, and AI cannot completely replace it in the short term.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He didn’t quite understand what James meant by &ldquo;always being optimistic&rdquo; and the relationship between &ldquo;risk control&rdquo; before, nor did he fully understand the advice on consumption behaviors such as buying houses and cars. After a period of reflection, he gradually understood the logic behind these concepts.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: At this stage, you can spend more money appropriately and enjoy life. The key is to learn to borrow money for consumption, rather than spending your own money. Investing and consumption are not contradictory; the important thing is to master the methods. For example, you can choose to take a taxi instead of spending time waiting for a bus. You can choose to spend money to buy a better car and enjoy a better driving experience, as long as you don’t spend your own money but pay through loans or other means. In 40 years, you will have 80 billion. Now, what you should be thinking about is how to spend money, not how to save money.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Investing in US indices means holding US assets, not holding US currency.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Investing in US stock index funds is about holding the assets of excellent US companies. The value of these assets is not highly correlated with the value of the US dollar. Even if the US dollar depreciates, the value of quality assets will continue to increase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The market always goes up. Investing requires patience. Wealth is worth the wait.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>In the long run, the market always goes up, and investors need to be patient and wait for wealth to grow. Short-term market fluctuations are normal and should not be overemphasized.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The financial industry wants to empty your pockets.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>The goal of the financial industry is to maximize its own interests and may use various methods to &ldquo;empty&rdquo; investors&rsquo; pockets. For example, they will design various complex financial products and use information asymmetry to induce investors to buy. Investors must improve their financial literacy to recognize and resist the traps and temptations of the financial industry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many walls in the world, but people inside the walls don’t know they are within the walls, because everyone thinks they are free and open-minded. Many who think they are outside the walls don’t know that they are inside the walls.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>The information filter bubble effect in the online world should make us realize that the world we perceive may not be the real world, and we should maintain an open mind. Everyone and every country has its own information barriers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The least guaranteed are laborers, and the second least guaranteed is real estate.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Laborers face the risk of unemployment, especially in the current era of rapid AI development. Real estate also has risks, such as natural disasters and market fluctuations. In comparison, the risk of long-term investing in quality stock assets (such as QQQ) is lower.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All laborers, regardless of whether you are young or old, remember that now artificial intelligence is sweeping the world, you will face unemployment.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>The development of AI will have a huge impact on the job market, and a large number of jobs will be replaced by AI. This is both a challenge and an opportunity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the future, the future will be left with very few capitalists and very few people who know how to control AI; the rest will be useless laborers.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>The social structure of the future will undergo tremendous changes, and you must become a capitalist or someone who can control AI. This means we need to continuously learn and master new skills in order to stand firm in the future society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to have a purpose in life, we don&rsquo;t need to do anything in life, we just need to be happy.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Encourage everyone to enjoy life and not set too many goals and pressures for themselves. The meaning of life lies in experiencing and feeling, rather than pursuing material wealth or social status.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don&rsquo;t necessarily have to like capitalist society, but we need to know how it makes money. We must stand on the same side as it, and then we can make a lot of money.
&ndash; Cat</p></blockquote>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to like capitalism, but we need to understand the rules of capitalism in order to profit from it. Only by understanding how capitalism works can we better use it to achieve our wealth goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I still criticize, it means I still care.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>The criticism of Taiwan is because of the love for this land and the hope that it will become better.</p>

<p>Many of us spend our entire lives struggling with money, working tirelessly for monthly bills, children&rsquo;s tuition, and meager retirement savings, like a hamster trapped in a cage, running hard but never escaping. Have you ever considered that you could have been richer? Have you ever thought that the sense of security you seek actually binds you, causing you to miss out on greater wealth?</p>
<p>Yes, everyone has an innate talent for wealth, a right we are born with, as natural as breathing, as natural as birds flying and fish swimming. Unfortunately, this right, this talent, has been forgotten, or even buried by our own hands through the &ldquo;education&rdquo; of reality and the &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; of society. From a young age, we are told: study hard, find a good job, work hard to earn money to support the family. No one tells us: you can be very rich, you have the right to be very rich, you don&rsquo;t even have to work so hard to have it all!</p>
<p>The value of this lecture is far more than teaching you one or two investment techniques; its true value lies in awakening you from that “hamster dilemma,” making you realize your dormant wealth potential, and showing you a path to financial freedom. This path does not require you to have Einstein&rsquo;s brain, nor does it require you to have Buffett&rsquo;s luck, it only requires you to change your mindset, and then, to move forward steadfastly.</p>

</h3>
<p>The extent of your vision dictates the height of your wealth. This isn&rsquo;t just some motivational slogan; it&rsquo;s a conclusion derived from rigorous logic and data analysis. Don&rsquo;t believe it? Let&rsquo;s crunch some numbers.</p>
<p>Many people find investing for something decades into the future to be too distant and unrealistic. But what if we look 60 years into the future? If you have 1 million now, through sensible investments and factoring in the power of compounding, you could have assets worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in a few decades. This is entirely possible; it’s actually a conservative estimate.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t ordinary people realize they can have so much wealth? The reason is simple: our concept of money is too narrow, we have insufficient understanding of our potential, and we lack a deep understanding of compounding, the &ldquo;eighth wonder of the world!&rdquo; Our understanding of money is still at the kindergarten level, while financial giants have a Ph.D.-level understanding of money, at least.</p>

</h3>
<p>Why is it so hard for most salaried workers to escape the &ldquo;rat race&rdquo; dilemma? Because they are trapped in a carefully designed cycle: you work hard for a month, and before the paycheck even warms up, it has to go to capitalists, the government, and the bank. For that meager salary, you have to work like a rat running tirelessly in a cage, never escaping that vicious circle.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that society constantly brainwashes you with &ldquo;consumerism,&rdquo; telling you that buying big houses, luxury cars, and branded bags is the standard for successful people. So, you&rsquo;re burdened with heavy loans, barely able to breathe under the weight of monthly interest payments. You don&rsquo;t dare to quit your job easily, and you don&rsquo;t dare to challenge your boss. You become a complete slave to capital.</p>
<p>Do you think this is your own choice? Do you think it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re not working hard enough? No! This is a structure intentionally or unintentionally maintained by the entire society and education system. What do schools cultivate? Compliant cogs in a machine, not independent-thinking creators. Financial institutions design complex financial products, ostensibly to help you manage your money, but in reality? They earn high fees and interest, while you can&rsquo;t even outpace inflation.</p>
<p>This “controlled environment” prevents you from realizing your potential for wealth, let alone changing your situation. You are like that hamster in the fable, the faster you run, the further you get from freedom.</p>

<p>Poverty is not your fault; it is the result of social structures that create class inequality. This structural inequality is like a thick curtain that obscures your innate talent for wealth, making you believe that you can only live a poor or middle-class life.</p>
<p>The statement &ldquo;wealth is a talent&rdquo; is not just a platitude, but a declaration, a solemn proclamation of your right! It tells you: you have the right to pursue a life of abundance, you have the right to enjoy beautiful things, you don&rsquo;t have to sacrifice your health, your happiness, or your dreams for money!</p>
<p>Recognizing this is the first step, and the most important step, to achieving financial freedom.</p>

<p>What is money? Money is a kind of energy, a tool. In a capitalist society, money can be used to exchange for various resources and services, including time, happiness, health, and even freedom. Money can also be used for investment, growing more money like seeds.</p>
<p>But remember, money itself is not the goal, but a means to achieve our life goals. We make money not to become slaves to it, but to live better, to realize our own dreams and those of our families, to have the ability to help those in need, and to better serve society.</p>
<p>Only by truly understanding the essence of money can we view it and use it correctly, rather than being enslaved by it.</p>

<p>Can ordinary people really achieve financial freedom? The answer is: of course they can! Moreover, achieving financial freedom is much simpler than you imagine.</p>
<p>The key to financial freedom is not about having a high IQ, or mastering complex techniques, but rather whether you have the correct investment mindset and whether you can persevere in executing it.</p>
<p>The path to financial freedom for ordinary people is actually very simple: choose the right investment vehicle, hold it for the long term, and let the power of compounding increase your wealth like a snowball. Specifically, it&rsquo;s recommended to invest in the U.S. Nasdaq 100 index fund, a relatively low-risk investment choice with excellent long-term performance. In the long run, its annualized return is considerable.</p>
<p>Many people might say, investing in index funds, isn&rsquo;t that something even an idiot can do? Yes, it&rsquo;s that simple! But the problem is, how many people can truly hold on for the long term?</p>
<p>Financial freedom is not achieved overnight; it requires patience and perseverance. In the course of investing, you will encounter all sorts of challenges and temptations, but as long as you believe in your choice and continue steadfastly, you will surely reach the other shore.</p>

<p>The biggest characteristic of the &ldquo;poor mindset&rdquo; is self-limitation. They habitually limit themselves with &ldquo;impossible,&rdquo; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; and &ldquo;too difficult.&rdquo; They don&rsquo;t see their potential or the hope for the future.</p>
<p>The key to shedding the &ldquo;poor mindset&rdquo; lies in changing your mindset and recognizing your wealth potential and rights. You have to believe that poverty is not your destiny, and that you have the ability to change your fate.</p>
<p>Specifically, you need to learn the right investment knowledge, rather than being led by so-called financial experts or the media. You need to understand that true wealth comes from long-term investment, not short-term speculation or blind consumption. You need to learn to delay gratification, using the money you save for investment, rather than for buying things that are non-essential.</p>
<p>More importantly, you need to cultivate the ability to think independently, not to be swayed by others or blindly follow trends. You need to develop an investment plan suitable for your own circumstances, and then steadfastly execute it.</p>
<p>Finally, you must remember that financial freedom is not something that happens overnight; it requires patience and perseverance, believing in the power of compounding, and adhering to long-term investment.</p>

<p>Why invest? The answer is simple: to make money work for us, not us for money.</p>
<p>Through investing, we can make our money grow continuously in the capital markets, thus realizing an increase in wealth. This increase can help us withstand inflation, ensure our future quality of life, and ultimately achieve financial freedom, so we no longer have to toil for a living.</p>
<p>Investing is also a way to plan for and secure the future. Through investment, we can accumulate funds for retirement, prepare for our children&rsquo;s education, and create conditions for realizing our dreams. Imagine, when you retire, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about whether your pension is enough, you can travel the world freely, do things you love, what a wonderful life that would be!</p>
<p>In addition, investing is also a way to participate in economic development. By investing in excellent companies, we can share the dividends of their growth, and also create value for society, promoting social progress.</p>

</h3>
<p>Why is it better to start investing early? The answer lies in the word &ldquo;compounding.&rdquo; Compounding, which Einstein called the &ldquo;eighth wonder of the world,&rdquo; is more powerful than you think.</p>
<p>For example, if we calculate with a 12% annual rate of return (a figure that can be achieved over the long term), a 30-year-old who invests $283 per month can accumulate approximately $1 million by the age of 60. But if they started investing at the age of 20, they would only need to invest $85 per month to reach the same goal!</p>
<p>See that? That is the power of compounding! The earlier you start investing, the less principal you need, and the shorter the time it takes to achieve your wealth goals. Because the effect of compounding causes your wealth to grow like a snowball, the longer the time, the faster the growth rate, and the greater the power.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if you don&rsquo;t have much capital right now, as long as you start investing early and stick with it over the long term, you can accumulate a considerable amount of wealth. Time is the best friend of investment.</p>

<p>Many people think bonds are a stable investment, and some even say they&rsquo;re safer than stocks. Is this really the case?</p>
<p>In the long term, bonds can actually be riskier than stocks. Don&rsquo;t believe it? Let&rsquo;s look at the data. How have different asset classes performed over the past 200 years, from the early 19th century to the early 21st century? The results show that the long-term returns of stocks are far higher than those of bonds, and bonds have sometimes even lost money over periods of 20 or even 30 years!</p>
<p>Why is this the case? Because the yield on bonds is usually low, making it difficult to withstand the erosion of inflation. Moreover, bond prices are affected by interest rate fluctuations and carry some risk. In contrast, although stocks fluctuate more in the short term, they have higher growth potential in the long term.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about real estate. Many people believe that buying a house is the most value-preserving investment, and some even consider their house their most important asset. However, have you ever considered whether real estate is really a good investment?</p>
<p>From an investment perspective, the main problems with real estate are its poor liquidity, high maintenance costs, and unremarkable long-term returns. Imagine if someone spent 10 million Taiwan dollars to build a villa 35 years ago, could that villa be worth 30 million Taiwan dollars 35 years later? It’s unlikely. However, if they had invested that 10 million Taiwan dollars in the stock market, based on historical average returns, the current value would have increased by two orders of magnitude, possibly becoming 1 billion Taiwan dollars!</p>
<p>More importantly, real estate also involves complex factors such as location and market fluctuations, all of which can affect its investment returns, and ordinary people find it difficult to control them.</p>
<p>And what if you treat your home as a place to live? Then you&rsquo;ll be burdened with decades of loan payments, and monthly mortgage repayments will weigh you down. For this house, you have to work hard, not dare to quit easily, and not dare to pursue your dreams, you become a complete “house slave.” Isn&rsquo;t that putting the cart before the horse?</p>
<p>Remember, a home to live in is essentially a consumption, not an investment.</p>

<p>The method of investing in index funds is really simple: choose a good index fund, such as the Nasdaq 100 index fund, and then buy in regularly, holding it for the long term. It&rsquo;s that simple. You don&rsquo;t need a background in finance, nor do you need to monitor the market every day. You can even leave it untouched for years.</p>
<p>But why is it that so few people are actually able to do this simple thing?</p>
<p>First, it requires you to have a long-term perspective and firm conviction. During market fluctuations, especially when the market is down, many people feel panic and anxiety, and even doubt their choice, eventually giving in and selling, and as a result? They often sell at the lowest point, missing out on the rebound that follows.</p>
<p>Second, it requires you to overcome your human weaknesses. In the course of investing, you&rsquo;ll encounter all sorts of temptations: today, this stock has hit its limit up, tomorrow, that concept is hot, the day after tomorrow, experts predict the market will plummet… this noise will interfere with your judgment, leading you to deviate from your original investment plan.</p>
<p>Many people, even those who have learned this simple investment method, still cannot do it well. Some investors are impatient to sell as soon as the market rises slightly, missing out on the big gains that come later; some investors, although they have set a fixed investment plan, are always unable to stick to it, going at it haphazardly; and other investors, because they hold other types of stocks or investments, are unable to make up their minds to switch to index funds.</p>
<p>What does all of this show? It shows that the success of investing depends not only on the method, but also on your mindset, whether you can overcome your human weaknesses, and whether you can steadfastly execute your investment plan.</p>

<li><strong>The &ldquo;Financial Expert&rdquo; Scam:</strong> Many so-called &ldquo;financial experts&rdquo; are actually just salespeople for financial products. In order to earn commissions, they will recommend various complex financial products to you, such as insurance, bonds, annuities, etc. These products often come with high fees and less-than-ideal long-term returns. Annuity products in particular, are not only low-yielding and high-risk, but also severely impact your asset allocation and tax planning. Remember, truly good investments are often simple, and those complicated products are often traps.</li>
<li><strong>Noise from the Media and &ldquo;Experts&rdquo;:</strong> Many media outlets and so-called &ldquo;investment experts,&rdquo; in order to grab attention, publish all sorts of sensational market predictions. One minute they&rsquo;re saying a bull market is coming, the next a bear market is coming, and the next, that a certain industry is about to explode… This noise severely interferes with your judgment, making you unable to focus on long-term investment. Remember, what really matters is the long-term trend, not the short-term fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>The Temptation of Short-Term Trading:</strong> Many people dream of getting rich overnight, so they like to buy and sell frequently, trying to capture every market fluctuation. However, short-term trading not only requires you to have superb skills and keen market intuition, but also to bear enormous risks. For ordinary investors, short-term trading is often not worth the effort, and can even lead to serious losses. Frequent trading is like a gambler in a casino, often eventually losing it all.</li>
<li><strong>The Risks of High Leverage:</strong> Some investors, in order to pursue higher returns, use excessive leverage, such as margin accounts. However, leverage is a double-edged sword, it can amplify your returns, but also amplify your losses. If used improperly, it can easily lead to total ruin, and even bankruptcy. Remember, the first priority of investment is to control risk, not to pursue high returns. Never put your fate in the hands of luck, especially not with leveraged fate.</li>
<li><strong>The Risk of Not Learning:</strong> Many people know nothing about investment. They don&rsquo;t understand the essence of investment, nor their own risk tolerance, nor the characteristics of the products they are investing in. Such blind investment is like crossing the road with your eyes closed, full of risks.</li>

<p>&ldquo;Never sell,&rdquo; these four words, don&rsquo;t they sound a bit extreme? But they are the secret to enduring market cycles, the essence of long-term investing.</p>
<p>The essence of investing is to share in the growth dividends of excellent companies, not to gamble, in a casino, diving in and out. The logic behind &ldquo;never sell&rdquo; is actually very simple: as long as you are investing in excellent companies, and as long as you believe that these companies can continue to grow, then you should hold them for the long term, sharing in the dividends that their growth brings.</p>
<p>Frequent buying and selling will not only increase your transaction costs, but will also cause you to miss out on the compounding effect of long-term holding. More importantly, it will expose you to human weaknesses.</p>

<p>Why is that? Because when the market is down, the stock prices of many high-quality companies will be severely undervalued, like a discounted sale, and buying at this time is like picking up a bargain.</p>
<p>Warren Buffett once famously said, &ldquo;Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.&rdquo; This quote is about this very principle.</p>
<p>Market downturns are temporary, while the market&rsquo;s long-term trend is upward. As long as you can overcome your fear and stick to your long-term investment strategy, you will be able to seize opportunities during market downturns, buy undervalued high-quality assets, and lay a solid foundation for future wealth growth.</p>

<p>The strategy of &ldquo;living off stock pledges&rdquo; can help you address your daily capital needs without selling your stock. This is a smarter way to manage finances.</p>
<p>Many people might ask, what is a stock pledge? Simply put, it is using your stock as collateral to borrow money from a financial institution. In this way, you can gain access to liquidity without selling your stock, and you can continue to enjoy the long-term appreciation of your stock.</p>
<p>Through stock pledges, you can avoid being forced to sell stocks with long-term growth potential due to temporary funding shortages. Furthermore, in many countries and regions, the capital gains tax rate is usually higher than the borrowing interest rate. Through stock pledges, you can also reasonably reduce your tax burden.</p>
<p>Of course, stock pledges also carry some risks. If the stock price drops sharply, you may need to provide additional collateral or face the risk of forced liquidation. Therefore, when using stock pledges, you must control your leverage ratio, and it is generally recommended that the pledge ratio not exceed 20% of your total assets.</p>

<p>In this age of information overload, we are bombarded daily with all sorts of information, especially in the field of investment. The opinions of various &ldquo;experts,&rdquo; various media reports, and various rumors, are difficult to distinguish between true and false, making people dizzy.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the ability to think independently, you can easily be swayed by this information and make wrong investment decisions.</p>
<p>Independent thinking is key to investment success. It means having your own judgment, not blindly following trends, not blindly believing in authority, and not being swayed by market sentiment.</p>
<p>The basis for independent thinking is learning and research. You need to continuously learn investment knowledge, study market laws, and understand the investment target. Only in this way can you form your own investment system and make correct decisions in the complex market environment.</p>
<p>Always remember that investment is your own business, and no one can make decisions for you.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Overthink Market Volatility:</strong> It is emphasized that ordinary investors do not need to over-focus on global affairs, short-term market fluctuations, company financial reports, etc., as these factors have limited impact on long-term investments. It points out that investors who frequently engage in short-term trading often &ldquo;pick up pennies and lose dollars,&rdquo; wasting both time and life.</li>
<li><strong>CLEC&rsquo;s Position:</strong> It is stated that CLEC (the club) is a non-profit investment and financial management channel that does not provide professional investment advisory services, nor does it receive any returns from members.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Warning:</strong> Investment involves risk; markets go up and down. Proceed with caution. Members need to conduct their own risk assessment and control and be responsible for their investment decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Asset Allocation:</strong> Over the past year, CLEC has continuously emphasized safe asset allocation, which is key to managing market risk and achieving steady long-term returns.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Video Resources:</strong> James has divided the four-hour-long video 00451 into short videos of about 15 minutes, making it easier for new members or those with limited time to learn. The short videos are subtitled in Chinese, English, and other languages to cater to members from different linguistic backgrounds.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended Learning Videos:</strong> It is recommended that everyone watch video 00451 for systematic learning. If you have time, you can watch videos 00398 and 00288. It is emphasized that investing is a field of study that requires continuous learning and practice.</li>
<li><strong>Necessity of Learning for New Members:</strong> For new members who have just joined CLEC, James recommends that they take the time to watch previous videos and systematically learn CLEC&rsquo;s investment philosophy and strategies to avoid repeatedly asking questions or making incorrect investment decisions due to misunderstandings.</li>
<li><strong>Answering Complex Questions:</strong> Some complex questions cannot be explained clearly through simple messages or emails. These questions often require a comprehensive analysis combining multiple videos and strategies, which members need to learn systematically to grasp.</li>
<li><strong>Refusal to Do Out-of-Scope Simulations:</strong> James clearly states that he will not consider scenarios beyond situation 1 to situation 9, nor will he do simulations outside of CLEC&rsquo;s investment framework for individual members.</li>
<li><strong>Global Investment Information:</strong> NASDAQ 100 index funds are available in many countries and regions around the world. James has compiled information from various locations into a document for members to easily access.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Context:</strong> It is emphasized that investments need to be viewed in the context of the current market, with a long-term perspective. It&rsquo;s important to believe that the market will eventually rise, investments require patience, and wealth accumulation takes time, using time to reap the great benefits of compound interest.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth Goals:</strong> James believes that CLEC members should all be able to achieve assets of over a hundred million in their lifetime. If this goal is not reached, it indicates that something might have gone wrong in the investment process, requiring reflection and improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Moving Toward Higher Goals:</strong> James mentions that many members&rsquo; assets have already exceeded one hundred million and are now moving toward the billion mark, which he is very pleased about.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Zealand Tax System:</strong> The tax system in New Zealand is similar to that in Australia. Even if stocks are not sold, tax is required on unrealized capital gains.</li>
<li><strong>Overseas Investment Tax:</strong> In New Zealand, unrealized capital gains from investments in overseas markets (such as buying US stocks like QQQ or NDQ) are subject to tax, with a high tax rate of 33% - 39%.</li>
<li><strong>Tax Avoidance Strategies:</strong> The USG fund issued in New Zealand may serve as a temporary tax avoidance measure, as investment in this fund may not require the payment of unrealized capital gains tax.</li>
<li><strong>ASB Securities Pledge:</strong> In New Zealand, ASB Securities can provide stock-pledged loans. The loan ratios vary depending on the fund. For example, some funds can borrow 65%, 70%, or even 50%.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long-Term Investment Wealth Expectations:</strong> James uses data to show that if you have 1 million USD now, long-term investment might turn it into 200 million USD; if you have 10 million NTD now, it could become 2 billion NTD in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Advocating Spiritual Consumption:</strong> James encourages everyone to engage in spiritual consumption, which are consumptions that leave no material trace and cause no environmental pollution. For example, the enjoyment of staying in a good hotel for a few thousand dollars may be better than buying a useless decorative item, as material possessions become old, break down, and are eventually discarded over time.</li>
<li><strong>Choice of Transportation:</strong> Whether to take a 40-minute bus ride or drive a 20-minute car depends on which method makes you feel more comfortable and less anxious. If it doesn’t cause anxiety, it’s a good choice.</li>
<li><strong>Reducing Material Desires:</strong> We should think about “what can we do without” rather than “what do we want.” Reduce our dependence on material goods, avoid buying unnecessary or excessive items, and focus on basic life necessities, such as healthy food.</li>
<li><strong>Rational Shopping:</strong> When shopping, rationally assess the practical use of the item and avoid blindly following trends in consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth Accumulation for Young People:</strong> Young people should try to reduce unnecessary spending and use the saved funds for investments to accumulate wealth more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Pursuit of Spiritual Eternity:</strong> Our goal is to pursue spiritual and investment eternity. Reduce material desires, simplify life, and use money for things that can bring long-lasting spiritual enjoyment.</li>

<li><strong>Finding Connections in Life:</strong> In the vast universe, we need to find connections with ourselves and others, especially when we are old and living alone. This connection can be marriage, partners, children, etc.</li>
<li><strong>About Giving Birth and Adoption:</strong> James suggests young members should either have or adopt children because we have sufficient financial resources to raise them, form families, and that it’s a human right, so they shouldn’t give up on it.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Challenges for Retail Investors in Stock Picking:</strong> Retail investors picking individual stocks is like trying to find good fruit in a basket full of rotten fruit. The result is often that the more you pick, the more you mess things up.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Cutting Losses:</strong> James uses the analogy of a broken elevator to illustrate that if an investment is losing money, it’s better to cut the loss and get on a different elevator (investment) rather than to continue waiting or trying to fix the broken one. When investment goes wrong, one should cut losses decisively instead of holding or averaging down.</li>
<li><strong>Capital Safety:</strong> James advises investors not to send funds overseas, but to keep them locally or in Hong Kong for capital safety.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t Blindly Pick Stocks:</strong> When individual investors can&rsquo;t distinguish between good and bad stocks, they should avoid stock picking to prevent unnecessary losses.</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledging Limitations:</strong> Investors need to acknowledge their cognitive limitations and their ignorance; this is the essence of investment wisdom.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cautious Cross-Border Investment:</strong> James points out that if stock investments in Taiwan are not performing well, it&rsquo;s even more unwise to venture into overseas markets like the U.S., because competition in those markets is much more intense.</li>
<li><strong>Two Strategies to Address Losses:</strong> For investors who are losing money in Taiwan stock investments, James gives two pieces of advice: sell all individual stocks and buy 00662 ETF at market price, and hold for the long term; or sell all stocks and put funds in bank deposits, and exit the stock market entirely to avoid further losses.</li>
<li><strong>Contributions of Taiwanese Retail Investors:</strong> James points out that Taiwanese retail investors contribute over 150 billion NTD annually in transaction taxes to the government, so the government is motivated to encourage day trading and other short-term transactions.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application of Beta Coefficient:</strong> In the US, adjusting the portfolio&rsquo;s beta coefficient to 1.2 is equivalent to using 20% leverage for investments.</li>
<li><strong>Order of Leverage Use:</strong> James suggests that investors first adjust the portfolio beta coefficient to 1.2, and then consider using credit, mortgages, and other forms of leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Borrowing Investment Strategy:</strong> After borrowing, it is still recommended to invest according to the 442/433 asset allocation ratio.</li>
<li><strong>Opposing Opportunism:</strong> James points out that some investors are always looking for various investment techniques or shortcuts instead of learning diligently, which is not recommended. He emphasizes that there are no shortcuts in investing; only through systematic learning and practice can one grasp the correct investment methods.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long-Term Returns on Property Investment:</strong> James uses a property worth 5 million USD as an example. If this money is invested and has an annualized return rate of 14%, it could grow to 1 billion USD after 40 years, and save the 40 years of potential mortgage repayments and property maintenance fees.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Cost of Renting:</strong> If you pay 15,000 USD in rent per month, the total amount repaid in 40 years will be as high as 22 million USD.</li>
<li><strong>Depreciation Risks of Property:</strong> A house built 60 years ago may no longer be habitable. Similarly, a house purchased now may face the same problem in 60 years. In contrast, renting allows the flexibility to choose appropriate housing based on changing needs.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing 1: <strong>Convenience of Having Funds.</strong> Brian shared his experience of seeing a dentist in Taiwan. Since he had ample funds, he could pay in cash, unlike some people with limited finances who might experience delays due to cash flow issues. He felt the convenience of having funds.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Agreed with Brian&rsquo;s point, stating that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really good to have money&rdquo; as it can solve many problems and can even &ldquo;buy&rdquo; better relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 2: <strong>Taiwan Living Experience.</strong> Brian chose to stay at a hotel instead of with his parents when returning to Taiwan. He felt that staying at a hotel offered more freedom and fewer constraints. Furthermore, when eating out, he could pay for himself instead of his parents or in-laws, which gave him a sense of financial independence and control.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Suggests that family gatherings in Taiwan can be held in hotels, and if family members are willing, they can also stay at the hotel together, using money to obtain a more comfortable living environment and a higher quality of life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 3: <strong>Fund Allocation and Investment Strategies.</strong> Brian re-adjusted his fund allocation based on James’s investment philosophy. He found that even in the worst market conditions (e.g., a 20% market drop), his funds were still safe. He used funds from broker loans and investment returns and calculated that even after retirement, if he continues to invest a fixed amount each year, his “visualization rate” would not be lower than 200%. He believes the Excel spreadsheets provided by James are very helpful for understanding how funds grow and managing asset allocation.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Affirming Brian&rsquo;s approach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 4: <strong>Building Confidence in Borrowing for Investment.</strong> Brian believes that if he never uses borrowing, he might feel psychological resistance when he actually needs to use it. Therefore, he started to try using broker loans and considered reinvesting the borrowed funds. He believes that practical operation can help better understand how to use borrowing and find the most suitable way.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Shared his own experience, that he uses borrowed money as much as possible, rather than spending his own money, when travelling or eating out. He emphasizes that his assets will never be spent, and any income will immediately be used to buy QQQ. He further explains that buying 00662 actually helps the Taiwan Central Bank activate its foreign exchange reserves, reduce inflationary pressure, and also activate idle capital in Taiwan. However, safe asset allocation is a prerequisite for borrowing to invest. Without understanding safe asset allocation, one cannot use this tool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding his fund allocation, should he put QQQ and QLD into a Roth IRA, and then use the borrowed funds for other investments, such as buying TQQQ, and whether his current fund allocation is reasonable and carries any risks?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regarding Asset Allocation:</strong> Brian&rsquo;s current approach is to invest some funds in QQQ, some in QLD (2x leveraged QQQ), and keep some in cash. James points out that when Brian&rsquo;s retirement account doesn&rsquo;t have much money, it is not very efficient or risk-free to pledge and put the money in the broker investment account, and to use leveraged funds (such as QLD).</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Black Swan Events:</strong> James emphasizes that Brian needs to have sufficient cash, exceeding the amount of his brokerage loans. This is to prevent &ldquo;black swan events,&rdquo; i.e., unpredictable major risk events.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended Asset Allocation:</strong> James suggests Brian puts QQQ and QLD into his Roth IRA account, and either keeps the traditional IRA account as cash or keeps enough cash in his brokerage account, ensuring that the cash amount exceeds the borrowed amount.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding 442/433 Allocation:</strong> James further explains that 442 and 433 are just references, and the specific asset allocation ratio needs to be adjusted according to individual situations. He emphasizes several key principles: have enough cash, and have more cash than borrowed money; the ratio of leveraged funds should not exceed the ratio of the original funds (such as QQQ). For young people, they can do a 442 allocation at the highest, meaning the ratio of leveraged funds and original funds are the same.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Allocation Adjustments:</strong> James points out that after allocating assets according to the 442 ratio, the ratio of leveraged funds will automatically increase as the market rises, which is normal. Because assets are increasing, and cash is also increasing, the overall safety is actually much higher than the beginning.</li>

<li>
<p>Sharing 1: <strong>Book Recommendations.</strong> Peter recommended two investment and financial management books: &ldquo;The Long Game&rdquo; by Nick Maggiulli and &ldquo;Atomic Habits&rdquo; by James Clear. He believes that many of the ideas in these books are very similar to James&rsquo;s investment philosophy.</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Stated that the content of the books was similar to the investment concepts they discussed, and if anyone has time, they should read them as there is a lot of data that can verify our previous viewpoints.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 2: <strong>Building a Habit of Borrowing for Investment.</strong> Peter shared his experience with borrowing for investment, believing that it&rsquo;s a habit that needs to be cultivated. Only by being accustomed to this operation will one not feel unfamiliar or resistant to borrowing when assets reach a certain scale (e.g., 1 million, 2 million). Peter also mentioned that in the investment process, you need to construct two curves in your mind: one is the total assets curve rising, and the other is the total liabilities curve also rising, but the slope of the total liabilities curve should be less than that of the total assets curve. This way, assets will increase over time, while the proportion of liabilities will decrease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 3: <strong>Negotiating Lower Loan Interest Rates with Banks.</strong> Peter shared his experience negotiating lower loan interest rates with the bank. He mentioned that loan interest rates can be negotiated with the bank. He personally called the bank and successfully lowered his loan interest rate by 0.7%. He encourages everyone to not be afraid to try, to take the initiative to communicate with the bank, and to fight for lower loan interest rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 4: <strong>Understanding &ldquo;Owning Equity Means Owning the World.&rdquo;</strong> Peter expressed that he was impressed with James&rsquo;s idea that &ldquo;when you own equity assets in Wall Street stocks, you own the world,&rdquo; and the idea of &ldquo;never sell assets.&rdquo; He now understands the importance of owning equity assets and the meaning of long-term holdings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 5: <strong>Importance of Spiritual Consumption.</strong> Peter highly agreed with the concept of &ldquo;spiritual consumption&rdquo; put forth by James. He believes that traveling, good food, having more children, and being present in their growth, are all good forms of spiritual consumption.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding funds management in Roth IRA and investment accounts. Terry mentioned that he has 401k, Roth IRA, and brokerage accounts in the US. He wants to know if he can use leverage in a Roth IRA account, and whether he must borrow via his brokerage investment account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restrictions on Retirement Accounts:</strong> James clearly stated that retirement accounts (such as 401k, Roth IRA) cannot be used as collateral, meaning one cannot use assets in retirement accounts to borrow. Only assets in a broker&rsquo;s investment account can be pledged for loans.</li>
<li><strong>Role of IRA Assets:</strong> James explained that while IRA assets cannot be used directly to pledge for borrowing, the amount of assets affects the interest rates of the loan. When brokers evaluate the borrower&rsquo;s overall financial situation, they consider the assets in the IRA account, which might lead to more favorable interest rates. However, the amount of assets in an IRA account does not determine how much can be borrowed.</li>
<li><strong>Calculating Loan Amounts and Interest Rates:</strong> James explained how loan amounts and interest rates are calculated. The amount that can be borrowed is usually 60% to 70% of the assets in the investment account. The interest rate on the loan is determined by a combination of factors, including the base lending rate, the size of assets in the investment account, and the size of assets in retirement accounts such as IRA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Can one increase income by selling Covered Calls for QQQ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opposing Covered Call Strategy:</strong> James explicitly opposed the Covered Call strategy that Terry suggested. He believes the strategy is not necessary and carries high risks.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Covered Call:</strong> James explained that if a Covered Call strategy is used and the market suddenly rises significantly, the options would most likely be exercised, forcing the investor to sell QQQ at the agreed price (usually below market price), thus missing out on the profits from the rise. Alternatively, the investor would need to pay more funds to repurchase QQQ.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing: <strong>Recognition of CLEC and James&rsquo;s Investment Philosophy.</strong> Jason first expressed his gratitude to CLEC and James, believing that they bring surprises each year. From the initial advice of &ldquo;sell individual stocks, sell actively managed funds, and go all-in on QQQ&rdquo; to last year&rsquo;s &ldquo;asset allocation,&rdquo; this year&rsquo;s &ldquo;continuous optimization of asset allocation,&rdquo; and now the &ldquo;442&rdquo; and &ldquo;433&rdquo; allocation, James&rsquo;s investment philosophy and strategies are constantly evolving and improving. This has helped investors avoid external interference and truly achieve &ldquo;not being overjoyed by external gains, and not being saddened by external losses.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: When doing a &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; of asset allocation, if the predetermined ratios are not met, for example, if the ratio of leveraged funds has not yet reached the requirement of a &ldquo;433&rdquo; allocation, is it still necessary to perform &ldquo;smart rebalancing?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trigger Conditions for Rebalancing:</strong> James explained that if the ratio of leveraged funds has not reached the predetermined target, for example, the 442 ratio, there is no need to do &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; for the time being. You can wait until the ratio reaches or exceeds the predetermined target before adjusting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Regarding how to solve children&rsquo;s university tuition fees. Jason mentioned that university fees in the US are very high, especially for out-of-state students, where tuition and living expenses could reach 100,000 USD annually. Some of his friends are considering &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; some funds, such as by purchasing annuities, insurance, or transferring funds to others&rsquo; names to apply for student aid to alleviate financial burdens. He would like to know what advice James has on this matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opposing the Practice of &ldquo;Hiding Money&rdquo;:</strong> James strongly opposed the practice of &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; funds to save on university fees. He believes this practice is counterproductive and may even be illegal.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages of Annuities and Insurance:</strong> James pointed out that investing funds in annuities or insurance may reduce the amount of assets needed for disclosure in the short term, potentially qualifying for more student aid. However, it results in a huge loss of investment returns in the long term. He uses an example of 500,000 USD; if that amount was used for investments with an annual return of 14%, it could grow to 1.3 billion USD in 60 years. Whereas if that money is invested in annuities or insurance, the rate of return would be much lower, and the liquidity of the funds would be restricted.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Risks of &ldquo;Hiding Money&rdquo;:</strong> James specifically emphasized that transferring funds to others&rsquo; names, for example, to parents in China, and then having parents send funds back to the US annually, is suspected of money laundering and fraud, which is a serious criminal act in the United States. If discovered, there are severe consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Suggested Practice:</strong> James suggested that instead of &ldquo;hiding money,&rdquo; the money should be used for investments to grow the wealth. Even if one does not help their children pay for university fees, children can apply for student loans themselves. When they graduate and the assets have grown in value, one can use that to help repay the loans.</li>
<li><strong>Other Options:</strong> James also mentioned that children can earn some of their living expenses by working part-time or at a side job, such as driving a rideshare or doing other small part-time jobs, where they can earn tens of thousands of USD each year.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing 1: <strong>Personal Investment Experience and Confidence.</strong> Opa shared his experience of going all-in on QQQ. He bought it at the peak of the market, and although it declined for some time, his investment recovered to the previous high by the first half of this year and is now highly profitable. This experience has given him great confidence in long-term investments and a deeper understanding of bear markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 2: <strong>Daughter&rsquo;s Investment Experience and Transformation.</strong> Opa mentioned that his daughter previously had more faith in her financial advisor, and had given the advisor more than 1 million USD to manage. However, the advisor&rsquo;s investment strategy was too diversified, allocating assets across 20-30 ETFs, covering various indexes and small-cap stocks, which resulted in poor overall returns. Opa had been trying to persuade his daughter to change her investment strategy, but she would not listen. It was not until recently, after having two children, that she began to reconsider due to increased financial pressure. At a Christmas family gathering, Opa once again explained the power of compounding and the impact of the technology sector on productivity to his daughter. His daughter finally understood the importance of long-term and focused investments and plans to transfer about 2 million USD to a broker account that allows stock pledges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding the loan interest rate on 2 million USD in a broker account. Opa mentioned that according to the broker’s website, the loan interest rates for 2 million USD is still very high. He would like to know how to get a lower interest rate, and whether the loan interest rate is calculated based on total assets or the actual amount of the loan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Negotiating Lower Interest Rates:</strong> James first pointed out that loan interest rates can be negotiated with the broker. He suggests that Opa&rsquo;s daughter directly contact the broker and ask for a lower rate.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rate Calculation Methods:</strong> James explained that brokers take a number of factors into consideration when assessing the loan interest rate, including the borrower&rsquo;s total assets, loan amount, and duration of the loan. Generally, the larger the total asset, the smaller the loan amount as a percentage of the total asset, and the longer the loan duration, the lower the interest rate.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rate for 2 Million:</strong> James estimated the loan interest rate that Opa&rsquo;s daughter could receive based on her situation. He mentioned that the base rate announced on the broker&rsquo;s website was just a benchmark, and the actual rate would require further negotiations. He recommends that Opa&rsquo;s daughter directly contact the broker&rsquo;s staff member, Lisa, for a more detailed consultation. He also provided a calculation formula: 2.9% - 0.5% = 2.4%. 2.9% is the base interest rate for a 2 million loan in the brokerage, and 0.5% is the discount that Opa&rsquo;s daughter could get based on the size of her assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Regarding how to perform asset allocation. Opa’s current asset allocation is 811, which means 80% QQQ, 10% QLD, and 10% Cash. His goal is to adjust the asset allocation to 442, which means 40% QQQ, 40% QLD, and 20% Cash. He wants to know if it’s better to put leveraged assets (such as QLD) in the Roth IRA account, and the normal account in cash plus QQQ, to better maintain the correct ratio of the standard account during a bear market. Also, if there is a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; asset allocation plan, should all the funds in the Roth IRA be allocated to QLD, and the normal account to cash plus QQQ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interpretation of 811 Allocation:</strong> James first interpreted the meaning of the 811 allocation and said that there is nothing wrong with the allocation approach.</li>
<li><strong>View on &ldquo;Perfect&rdquo; Allocation:</strong> James believes that if one only has a Roth IRA account and a normal account, then it is acceptable to allocate all of the Roth IRA funds to QLD and allocate the normal account to cash plus QQQ.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility of Asset Allocation:</strong> James emphasizes that the specific asset allocation ratio should be adjusted based on individual situations. For example, it depends on the percentage of total assets that the Roth IRA account represents. If the Roth IRA account represents 40% of the total asset, then all the funds in the Roth IRA account can be allocated to QLD to reach the 442 allocation target. However, if the Roth IRA funds only account for a smaller percentage, say 20% or 30%, then the 442 target allocation cannot be reached, and the allocation will most likely be 622.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage Choices:</strong> James also mentioned that if one hopes to increase the percentage of the Roth IRA account to 40%, one can consider using 3x leveraged ETFs such as TQQQ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: Regarding the use of funds in his 401k account. Opa mentioned that he and his wife&rsquo;s 401k accounts are still in their respective company plans and cannot be rolled over until they reach the age of 65 (still two years away). He would like to know how to manage these funds now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Allocating Cash to the 401k Account:</strong> James recommended that Opa allocate cash to his 401k account, because the 401k account usually has some tax-saving policies. Keeping cash in the 401k account can take full advantage of these policies.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding QQQ’s Long-Term Investment Returns:</strong> James shared some data regarding QQQ’s long-term investment returns. He pointed out that QQQ’s annualized return over the last 5 years is approximately 19%, the annualized return over the last 10 years is approximately 17%, and the annualized return over the last 20 years is approximately 14%. He also points out that QQQ is accelerating human growth, and its future return might be higher and higher, therefore investments must be made.</li>

<li>
<p>Sharing 1: <strong>Observations and Reflections on Social Phenomena.</strong> Young shared an observation she made at work and in her life: many people work very hard in their respective fields and put in a lot of time and energy, whether it&rsquo;s running a business, working at a job. However, they do not give much importance to how they manage their money, or they don&rsquo;t know how to make effective investments. Young believes this might be because they do not understand investments, or they do not realize the importance of investments. She emphasizes that as long as one has the correct investment methods, they can achieve greater freedom in their work and life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 2: <strong>Risks of Insurance Products.</strong> Young has worked in the insurance industry for many years. She has come in contact with many clients and has seen many unreasonable insurance products. She gave a specific example: a client paid 500,000 RMB in insurance premiums every year for three years, totaling 1.5 million RMB. It has been 8 years now, and some years ago, this client borrowed over 800,000 RMB due to a cash shortage. If the client now wants to withdraw the policy, after deducting the borrowed amount, he can only get back 300,000 RMB. That is to say, he would still lose money. In addition, the client has never paid any interest on the loan. Young points out that the interest rate on policy loans in China is often 5%, while the return on the policy is only 3%. This means the interest paid annually by clients is far higher than the returns provided by the insurance company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing 3: <strong>Agreement with James&rsquo;s Investment Philosophy.</strong> Young stated that she agrees with James&rsquo;s investment philosophy, especially the point that &ldquo;you shouldn’t try to make money that isn’t necessary.&rdquo; She believes that we should focus our primary time and energy on our work and lives, instead of spending a lot of time researching investment products such as stocks and funds. All one needs to do is to hold long-term investments in the stocks of the world&rsquo;s best 100 companies, and then spend more time enhancing our spiritual energy, being with our families, and enjoying life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question: Regarding the risks for clients opening an account in Hong Kong to purchase US Treasury bonds. Young mentioned that the interest rates on Chinese government bonds are very low, at about 1.6%, while the interest rates on US Treasury bonds are as high as 4.6%. Some people she knows are recommending that Chinese clients open bank accounts in Hong Kong, then exchange RMB into USD to purchase 5 or 10 year US Treasury bonds. She would like to know what risks are involved in such operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Need to Understand Specific Operational Details:</strong> James first pointed out that he would need to understand more specific operation details before he can assess the risks involved. He specifically mentioned that the normal procedure for treasury bonds does not require going through an insurance company, and he was unclear about the specific procedure and organizations involved in purchasing US treasury bonds, therefore he cannot provide concrete suggestions.</li>
<li><strong>Doubts Regarding &ldquo;High Returns&rdquo;:</strong> James expressed doubts about this kind of &ldquo;high return&rdquo; investment method. He believes that if there really was such a good investment opportunity, the insurance company&rsquo;s own funds would be invested, instead of recommending it to clients. He reminds everyone not to easily trust the so-called high-return and low-risk investment products, because there are often unknown risks behind them.</li>

<p>Question 1: Regarding asset allocation after retirement and calculating amounts for pledging and borrowing. Wave mentioned that she is planning to retire this year, and she would like to know whether she can pledge her stocks to borrow funds after retirement, and how to calculate the amount that can be borrowed. She also mentioned that her 30 year-old son would like to understand the issues of pledging and loans, and how to explain the methods of calculation to him, and where to find relevant information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation after Retirement:</strong> James first introduced two different methods of asset allocation after retirement:
<ul>
<li><strong>Not Pledging and Borrowing:</strong> If you are not planning to pledge and borrow funds, you can allocate 80% of your assets to QQQ and 20% to cash. Each year, you can use the cash part to pay living expenses, and rebalance at the end of the year, re-adjusting the ratio back to 80% and 20%.</li>
<li><strong>Pledging and Borrowing:</strong> If you plan to pledge and borrow funds, then you should adopt the 433 method of asset allocation, which means 40% QQQ, 30% QLD (2x leverage QQQ), 30% cash (or money market fund). Each year, you can borrow 2% of your total asset for living expenses, and also rebalance at the end of the year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Calculating Loan Amounts:</strong> James explained that the amount that can be borrowed depends on total assets and the type of asset. Generally, about 60%-70% of the total assets can be borrowed. However, different types of assets will have different ratios. For example, the amount that can be borrowed from QQQ is about 70%, while the amount that can be borrowed from cash and money market funds such as SWVXX can be as high as 96%.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding the Choice Between 442 and 433:</strong> James points out that for young people, 442 and 433 are both acceptable asset allocation options. The 442 allocation can achieve higher expected returns, but the risk is also comparatively higher; the 433 allocation is more stable. He suggests that Wave&rsquo;s son choose the allocation method most suitable for his personal risk tolerance and investment goals. If one plans to do pledging from the very start, 433 allocation can be considered, because the taxes paid will be less when making changes to the assets.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Learning Resources:</strong> James told Wave that he had organized and provided all of the articles and video links that covered the topics of asset allocation and pledging stock for loans, and she can find details on calculation methods and operation guides from these resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Regarding the view that “the estate will only be 1 million.” Wave mentioned that she recently saw a video by James that mentioned “the estate will only be 1 million in the future,” which moved her greatly. She believes that if one can increase one&rsquo;s wealth via borrowing for investment, and use that wealth for helping others during one&rsquo;s lifetime, that would be very meaningful.</p>

<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explaining &ldquo;Estate Will Only Be 1 Million&rdquo;:</strong> James explained that it does not actually mean that only 1 million will be left to the children as an estate, but that one should use investment loans to make the most of one&rsquo;s assets, so that one can do more meaningful things with the funds, instead of leaving all of the wealth to the children. He used an example of 300 million in assets. If 290 million are borrowed out, only 1 million will be left, but the 300 million in assets, and the 290 million in liabilities, can still be transferred to the children, and they can use that borrowed money and the rest of the assets.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Estate Planning:</strong> James also mentioned that in order to avoid high estate taxes, one can consider establishing a trust, and transferring assets into that trust, similar to how Buffet and Bill Gates do it.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding the calculation and negotiation of interest rates on stock-pledged loans, and the impact of retirement account assets on borrowing rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Calculation:</strong> James explained that interest on stock-pledged loans consists of two parts: a fixed spread (also called fixed interest rate spread, which depends on the broker and borrower’s creditworthiness) and a floating rate (usually referencing SOFR, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate). For a loan of 1 million, if the fixed spread is 4%, the total borrowing rate may reach about 8% when combined with the floating rate.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rate Negotiation:</strong> James emphasized that loan interest rates are negotiable with the broker. He advises Julia to proactively communicate with the broker to negotiate a lower rate.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Retirement Account Assets:</strong> James pointed out that while assets in retirement accounts (such as IRA, 401k) cannot be directly pledged for loans, the amount of these assets impacts the borrowing rate. When assessing the borrower’s overall repayment ability and risk status, brokers will consider the assets in retirement accounts. If the assets in retirement accounts are substantial, the borrower might qualify for more favorable interest rates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: After opening an account, can one apply for a stock-pledged loan immediately? Will the borrowing limit be adjusted annually?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apply Immediately:</strong> James confirmed that one can apply for a stock-pledged loan immediately after opening an account.</li>
<li><strong>Limit Adjustments:</strong> James explained that the borrowing limit is calculated based on the asset value of the account, which will fluctuate with market conditions. Therefore, the borrowing limit is not fixed but is dynamically adjusted according to the market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: If there are investment losses, will the borrowing limit decrease?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yes:</strong> James clearly pointed out that if there are investment losses, leading to a decline in the account asset value, the borrowing limit will decrease accordingly. He gave an example: If there were originally 1 million in assets, the borrowing limit may be 700,000. If there was a loss of 300,000, leaving 700,000, the borrowing limit would become 490,000 (70% of 700,000). Brokers will re-calculate the borrowing limit based on the updated net asset value.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Adjustment of Borrowing Limits:</strong> James emphasized that brokers dynamically adjust the borrowing limit based on the real-time value of the assets in the account. This means if there are investment losses, the borrowing limit decreases. If there are investment profits, the borrowing limit increases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 4: What is the difference between stock-pledged loans and margin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Costs:</strong> James pointed out that the interest on margin loans is usually higher than that on stock-pledged loans.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Forced Liquidation:</strong> James explained that both margin and stock-pledged loans carry the risk of forced liquidation. However, margin has a stricter forced liquidation mechanism. When the net asset value of the account falls below a certain maintenance margin ratio, the broker will immediately force liquidation to recover the loan. Stock-pledged loans have a relatively more lenient forced liquidation mechanism. Brokers may give the borrower some buffer time or communicate with the borrower before forcing liquidation. Overall, the forced liquidation risk of margin loans is higher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 5: After borrowing funds, can they be used for investment?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No:</strong> James stated clearly that using borrowed money to reinvest in the stock market is illegal. He emphasized that brokers usually specify in the loan agreements that the loan cannot be used to purchase stocks or other investment products.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Violations:</strong> James explained that brokers can monitor the flow of funds, and although it may not immediately trigger forced liquidation, if such activities are discovered, it may lead to the account being frozen and loans being recalled with severe consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> James advises members to strictly comply with the broker’s regulations and use the borrowed funds for consumption or other non-investment purposes.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Regarding the calculation of borrowing limits under a 433 asset allocation. Shawn mentioned that he is currently using a 433 asset allocation, which means 40% QQQ, 30% QLD (2x leveraged QQQ), and 30% cash. He would like to know if, when calculating his borrowing limits, the broker also includes the QLD component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>QLD is Not Included:</strong> James clearly stated that in a 433 allocation, the broker does not include QLD when calculating the borrowing limit. This means only the QQQ and cash parts are used to calculate the borrowing limit.</li>
<li><strong>Specific Calculation:</strong> James provided an example: If Shawn has 1 million in total assets, and the 433 allocation is 400,000 in QQQ, 300,000 in QLD, and 300,000 in cash, the amount that can be borrowed is 70% of the 400,000 in QQQ, which is 280,000, plus 96% of the 300,000 in cash (assuming the borrowing ratio for cash or money market funds such as SWVXX is 96%), which is 288,000. Combined, the total amount that can be borrowed is 568,000.</li>
<li><strong>Significance of the 433 Allocation:</strong> James explained that the significance of the 433 allocation lies in its balance of returns and risks. By allocating a certain percentage of leveraged funds (such as QLD), the expected return of the overall investment portfolio can be increased. At the same time, allocating a certain percentage of cash can reduce the risk of the investment portfolio and provide a buffer during market declines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: If the 433 allocation method is used and the total asset is 1 million, then borrowing 2% annually (20,000) may not be enough for retirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 Million in Assets Not Enough for Retirement:</strong> James agreed with Shawn’s point. He pointed out that if the total assets is only 1 million, even if 2% is borrowed annually, that would only be 20,000, which would not be enough for retirement.</li>
<li><strong>433 Allocation is for Total Assets:</strong> James emphasized that the 433 allocation is with regard to the total assets, not a single account. He advises Shawn to include all assets, including retirement accounts (such as IRA, 401k) and non-retirement accounts, in the 433 asset allocation framework.</li>
<li><strong>Allocation Across Different Accounts:</strong> James advises that QQQ and QLD should be allocated primarily to retirement accounts, because retirement accounts usually have tax benefits, allowing for tax deferral, thus enhancing the effect of compounding returns. The cash portion should primarily be allocated to non-retirement accounts to allow for ease of access when needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: Concerned about the possibility of hacking or accidental errors leading to the sale of QQQ; is there a way to restrict the selling of QQQ in the account?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo;s Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Security Concerns:</strong> James stated he understands Shawn&rsquo;s concern because long-term holdings of QQQ, once sold, would lead to large tax burdens.</li>
<li><strong>Possibility of Restricting Selling:</strong> James said that he is not certain whether there is a function that directly restricts the selling of a specific stock in the account, as he does not work at a brokerage and is unclear about the specific operation permissions and function settings. However, he advises Shawn to contact the broker directly (for example, Lisa, whom he recommended) and inquire if they have the relevant settings or services.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthening Account Security:</strong> James emphasized that protecting the account is very important. He advised Shawn to take actions to strengthen the security level of the account, such as using a strong password, enabling two-factor authentication, and using a hardware security key.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Investing requires learning, new members need to watch previous videos to learn systematically.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The background of this idea is the influx of new members, who are asking many questions that have already been answered in previous videos. Therefore new members need systematic learning.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Acknowledging one’s own ignorance is power, and ignorance is wisdom.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The reason why many retail investors lose money is that they are overconfident, trade frequently, chase highs and sell lows, and cannot understand the essence of the market. Acknowledging one&rsquo;s cognitive limitations is necessary to avoid making rash decisions, and to make more rational investment decisions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s great to have money, you can use it to resolve worries, and to buy relationships.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is based on Brian’s sharing of his experiences after gaining financial independence, and his ability to spend his own money, and treat his family, which gave him more freedom and control. It shows the conveniences that money provides.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Humanity is growing at an accelerating pace, and investment returns will get higher and higher.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This conclusion is based on data on QQQ&rsquo;s past 20 years of investment returns, and emphasizes the effects of compound interest due to technological developments. Long-term investment in high-quality assets that are representative of the direction of technological development allows one to share the bonuses of human progress.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Encourage borrowing for investment, leave only 1 million in the estate, show respect.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is based on long-term investments, compounding returns, and sensible asset allocation, allowing one to maximize wealth, and to use loans to enhance one&rsquo;s quality of life, or to help others. With sensible asset allocation, loans for investment can accelerate the growth of wealth, and not simply accumulating wealth to leave to the next generation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There are no shortcuts in investing, only through systematic learning and practice can one master correct investment methods.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is a message to those who are trying to find investment skills and shortcuts, but are unwilling to learn systematically. Investing is a complex field of study that requires continuous learning and practice in order to improve one&rsquo;s investment expertise.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>When you own equity assets in Wall Street stocks, you own the world.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is an emphasis on the importance of long-term holdings of high-quality equity assets. Stocks are not merely an investment tool, but also represent ownership of a company. By holding the stocks of the world’s best companies, one can share in the wealth generated by these companies worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t try to make money that isn’t necessary.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is to advise investors not to over-pursue short-term gains while overlooking the value of long-term investing. We should focus our main time and energy on our work and lives, instead of spending too much time researching short-term market fluctuations or attempting to earn the difference by trading frequently.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The numbers 442 and 433 are merely references, and the specific asset allocation ratio must be adjusted according to individual situations.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is to emphasize the flexibility and personalization of asset allocation. Each person has a different risk tolerance, investment goals, capital size, etc., and therefore, they need to devise the appropriate asset allocation plan based on their actual situation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Protecting account security is very important.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This reminds investors to take account security seriously, and to take the necessary actions to prevent the account from being stolen or accidentally mishandled. Because if this occurs, it will lead to severe losses, and especially for long-term held assets, the losses would be even greater.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>What influences a person&rsquo;s future wealth the most,
is whether they have started managing their finances.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Everyone Can Achieve Wealth Through Personal Finance</strong></p>
<p>This book aims to illustrate a simple truth: investing and managing your finances can not only improve the financial situation of an individual or family, but is also an excellent path to wealth creation.  Furthermore, anyone can achieve wealth through personal finance. You don&rsquo;t need to be rich, have a high income, possess a high degree, have specialized knowledge or advanced skills, nor rely on luck. What you need is the desire for wealth, a correct investment philosophy (not just techniques), and the patience to wait for the long term.  Therefore, whether a person has money or not, or how high their income is, doesn&rsquo;t matter. What truly influences a person&rsquo;s future wealth is whether they have started managing their finances. This endeavor is not easy, but it&rsquo;s undoubtedly worth your effort!</p>
<p>Readers, please immediately review your current asset allocation. Is too much of your capital sitting in bank accounts or other &ldquo;guaranteed return&rdquo; investments?  Is your investment portfolio sufficiently diversified? Do you frequently buy and sell in the stock market?</p>
<p>After understanding your asset allocation, you should earnestly plan your financial goals and follow these five principles:</p>
<p><em>1. Clearly define the amount of wealth you hope to achieve and keep it in mind at all times. Simply thinking &ldquo;I want to be rich&rdquo; is not enough.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Set a specific date for achieving your goal.</em></p>
<p><em>3. Determine what price you&rsquo;re willing to pay and what actions you&rsquo;ll take to reach your ideal goal.</em></p>
<p><em>4. Think about your goal at least twice a day to reinforce your belief.</em></p>
<p><em>5.  Take action, whether you feel completely ready or not.</em></p>
<p>In Appendix II, readers can use the wealth creation formula and examples provided to calculate how to achieve their financial goals.</p>
<p>Your future wealth depends on what you do today. Don&rsquo;t let unnecessary hesitation cast a shadow on your heart. As long as you understand investment and financial management, you too can become wealthy in the future. Everyone possesses the necessary ingredients for wealth creation: a small amount of capital and a God-given resource—time. As long as you are willing to learn about personal finance, you have the potential to become a multi-millionaire.</p>
<p>When you find people around you feeling lost due to a lack of vision for the future, share with them the &ldquo;¥14,000 a year for 40 years can make you a multi-millionaire&rdquo; formula and help them reignite their hope.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Dependence Is Your Own Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>The unequal distribution of wealth in today&rsquo;s society is increasingly severe. Some blame flawed policies, others point to artificial market manipulation. I believe neither is the primary cause.  One of the main reasons for the wealth gap is the disparity in financial literacy among people.</p>
<p>The reason for poverty in modern times is not so much insufficient income, lack of thrift, or excessive spending, but rather improper financial management. In modern society, achieving financial independence after the age of 40 is a fundamental responsibility for everyone. Whether you want to or not, or whether you like it or not, investment and financial management have become essential knowledge for modern individuals. Remember, with our current income levels and investment opportunities, &ldquo;remaining poor after 40&rdquo; is self-inflicted, and &ldquo;not being a multi-millionaire after 70&rdquo; is due to a lack of financial knowledge.</p>
<p>Advances in modern medicine have increased human life expectancy, leading to an aging society.  Longer lifespans are a blessing, but enjoying a comfortable retirement is even more crucial. We must accumulate sufficient wealth to secure our lives in old age.</p>
<p><strong>Effortless Personal Finance, Enjoy the Process</strong></p>
<p>From the examples provided in this article, we can see that those who are good at managing their finances understand how to invest their assets in stocks and real estate with high long-term returns, and they avoid unnecessary short-term trading, thus achieving wealth with ease.  Those who are not good at managing their finances either focus solely on saving and keeping their assets in &ldquo;safe&rdquo; bank deposits or try to get rich quickly by engaging in short-term trading in the stock or futures markets. These individuals will eventually be left far behind in the race for financial success.</p>
<p>Most people keep their assets in financial institutions without investing them, and when they do start investing, they aim for quick riches.  As a result, their money stagnates in banks, and their pursuit of quick wealth often leads to substantial losses.  They fail to realize that with a little courage, by investing in stocks and real estate and patiently waiting for decades, they can naturally achieve wealth.</p>
<p>Simply put, building wealth through personal finance only requires two things: investing your capital in areas with high returns and having the patience to wait for the long term. The required investment is low, the probability of success is high, and the process is relaxed and enjoyable.</p>
<p>I advise readers not to rush to get rich through investment, causing anxiety and ultimately achieving the opposite of what they desire.  By following the methods described in this book, you can achieve financial success without expending excessive time and energy, allowing you to focus on your existing career.</p>
<p>Personal finance is a marathon, not a sprint. If you view the entire process from a long-term perspective, temporary setbacks don&rsquo;t signify failure, and momentary gains don&rsquo;t guarantee lasting success. With this mindset, you can maintain a more open perspective and avoid becoming overly attached to gains and losses.</p>
<p>I admit that consistently buying assets and holding them long-term can make personal finance seem dull and unbearable. However, before engaging in any financial activities, investors must clarify their objectives: is it to build wealth or to seek the thrill of gambling? Personal finance can not only lead to wealth but also bring joy and knowledge.  Everyone should learn how to manage their finances and find enjoyment in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t Feel Guilty About Being Wealthy</strong></p>
<p>Wealth should be acquired and used ethically. You don&rsquo;t need to apologize to others for your wealth. Only the pursuit of wealth through unscrupulous means is sinful and unfortunate.  Therefore, everyone should not only be confident but also feel obligated to earn wealth. There&rsquo;s no need to be secretive or ashamed about pursuing wealth. On the contrary, being financially dependent is a burden on society.  Moreover, wealthy individuals are more capable of contributing to society.  In short, if you can&rsquo;t find a good reason why getting rich is bad, why not allow yourself to become wealthy?</p>
<p>You earning more in the investment market doesn&rsquo;t mean others will earn less or lose more.  If everyone is proficient in managing their finances, not only can individuals prosper, but economic resources can also be utilized effectively, leading to rapid overall economic growth.  In a market economy, the wealth of society is built upon the wealth of its people. Only a prosperous populace can create a prosperous economy.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s financially driven world, whether for personal advancement or the benefit of society as a whole, everyone should strengthen their understanding of personal finance. When everyone is skilled in managing their finances, individuals and families can live prosperous lives, the wealth gap can be narrowed, and the nation can progress and flourish.</p>
<p><strong>Action Speaks Louder Than Words</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowing and not doing is not knowing.&rdquo; The biggest obstacle to personal finance is not that it&rsquo;s difficult to do, but that it&rsquo;s difficult to start.  The key to overcoming this is to act immediately.  One of the main reasons for failure in personal finance is avoiding decisions.  However, if you want to achieve your goal of building wealth through investment, there&rsquo;s no other way than to take action.</p>
<p>After reading the basic principles of investment and financial management outlined in this article, you should understand that building wealth is not only achievable but also not difficult.  So, act now! Time is money. The earlier you start, the sooner you&rsquo;ll reach your financial goals and share the fruits of your labor with your family.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, changes in society, politics, economics, and finance will accelerate, and the resulting redistribution of wealth will inevitably follow suit.  For yourself, your family, and society as a whole, managing your finances is a role everyone should embrace.</p>
<p><strong>Persistence Is Key</strong></p>
<p>For readers seeking quick riches, this book might disappoint you.  A more accurate title would be: &ldquo;How to Invest and Manage Your Finances to Slowly but Steadily Build Wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many believe that successful people are infallible—never failing, never experiencing losses.  Many also think they must be omniscient and possess sufficient knowledge before they can start investing and managing their finances.  Our most common flaw is our unwillingness to try repeatedly and to persevere. Building wealth through personal finance is not difficult! The reason most people don&rsquo;t achieve their goals is their inability to persevere and their lack of patience.</p>
<p>Persistence is essential for success in personal finance. Suppose you embark on a wealth-building plan and encounter setbacks along the way. Don&rsquo;t be discouraged. Some people regularly save and invest annually.  When prices rise, they are satisfied and continue their plan. But when prices fall, they panic and abandon their investment strategy.  They fail to understand that price fluctuations are inherent in the investment market, and investment results will inevitably fluctuate.</p>
<p>If, midway through your financial plan, you succumb to the temptation to spend your investment capital or give up due to repeated setbacks, all your previous efforts will be wasted.  <strong>Success in personal finance depends on endurance and resolve:  endurance to delay gratification and resist immediate consumption temptations; and resolve to withstand significant wealth fluctuations over long periods without losing your composure.  As long as you have perseverance and resolve, trust in compound interest, and believe in the &ldquo;wealth creation formula,&rdquo; the ultimate wealth will undoubtedly be yours.</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;No dreams, no wealth.&rdquo;  Those who build wealth through personal finance must be driven by desire and ambition.  They also need sufficient courage, knowledge, patience, and perseverance.  A lack of courage, flawed methods, impatience, or giving up halfway will not work. Whether you can achieve wealth and financial independence in the future depends entirely on your actions and efforts today.</p>
<p><strong>Unlock Your Hidden Wealth Potential</strong></p>
<p>Believe it or not, the price of living a wealthy and successful life is no greater than the price of living a poor and miserable one. Achieving this depends entirely on wisdom, belief, and action. After reading this book, readers should understand that everyone can achieve wealth through personal finance. The reason most people are not wealthy is not due to low income, but rather a lack of understanding of how to create wealth through investment and financial management. The primary purpose of this book is to help everyone unlock their hidden wealth potential.</p>
<p>If, after reading this book, you still cannot effectively apply these investment principles to manage your money and improve your financial situation, then this book is a complete failure.  Financial education is not merely about imparting knowledge; its significance lies in genuinely changing the reader&rsquo;s financial behavior.</p>
<p>This is a book of action, not a textbook for enhancing investment knowledge or a &ldquo;decorative book&rdquo; for your bookshelf.  This book aims to inspire readers to change their mindset and behavior. Its success depends on readers taking action based on the core principles presented, breaking free from mediocrity, and embarking on the path to wealth. Therefore, at the end of most chapters, key points are summarized for readers to reflect upon and apply.</p>
<p>Investment and financial management can not only lead to wealth but also bring joy to investors. Everyone should learn how to manage their finances and reap the substantial rewards.  I believe most readers already possess the basic requirements for building wealth: a small amount of capital, sufficient time, and the investment knowledge gained from this book.  The world of personal finance, full of changes and opportunities, awaits you.  It is filled with treasures and pitfalls. Don&rsquo;t hesitate, and don&rsquo;t leave empty-handed.</p>
<p>The principles of building wealth through investment and financial management are neither profound nor mysterious. They are absolutely achievable for everyone, and many have indeed easily become wealthy through these methods.  As we&rsquo;ve mentioned before, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re willing to learn, managing your finances is as simple as walking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the financial principles presented in this book, you&rsquo;ll find many that contradict deeply ingrained investment concepts and financial habits, and some even go against human nature.  Therefore, to realize the ideal of wealth creation through investment and financial management, the first step is to break free from some &ldquo;deep-rooted and misguided&rdquo; investment concepts, common knowledge, and habits.  Almost none of these concepts and principles are easy to achieve. Therefore, I advise readers to not only read each chapter carefully but also to review, reflect, establish strict rules, and ultimately change their behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Wealth Is a Means to a Better Life</strong></p>
<p>Finally, this book must emphasize that <strong>wealth is not the purpose of life, but a means to create a better life.</strong>  The ultimate goal of investment and financial management is not just to become rich, but to use wealth to realize your life&rsquo;s aspirations.  Therefore, <strong>a fulfilling and balanced life is the starting point for personal finance.</strong></p>
<p>Everyone should actively and optimistically plan and execute their lifelong financial journey.  Based on the principles we&rsquo;ve presented, everyone can achieve substantial wealth through personal finance without sacrificing time, energy, work, or life.  However, it&rsquo;s crucial to remember that <strong>only those who balance career, life, health, family, and wealth can be considered truly successful in managing their finances.</strong>  Those who gain the world&rsquo;s riches but lose their health, family, and the meaning of life cannot be considered truly successful.  In today&rsquo;s society, many are lost in the pursuit of wealth, sacrificing more valuable things in life.  Therefore, this principle of balancing personal finance and life is particularly important and deserves careful consideration.</p>
<p>Although this book repeatedly emphasizes that success in personal finance depends on mindset, time, and action, not luck, I still congratulate you, the reader, on being fortunate enough to encounter this book. By adhering to the investment principles within, you are sure to become a multi-millionaire in the decades to come!</p>

      <description>This appendix explores the power of compound interest and how to leverage it for financial success. It explains the concept of compounding, illustrating through examples and charts how it can lead to significant wealth growth over time.  A formula for calculating future wealth is provided to help readers plan their financial goals, emphasizing the crucial roles of time and rate of return in compound interest investing.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Accumulating wealth isn&rsquo;t about cutting expenses,<br>
but about the compounding power of money making money.</p></blockquote>
<p>Albert Einstein, considered one of history&rsquo;s greatest scientists, was once asked, &ldquo;What is the most powerful force in the world?&rdquo; His answer wasn&rsquo;t the force of colliding planets or the power of a nuclear explosion, but &ldquo;compound interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the previous examples demonstrate, the factor that allows a yearly saving of 14,000 yuan to grow to over 100 million yuan in 40 years is &ldquo;compound interest.&rdquo; Since compound interest is the primary driver of accelerated wealth growth, understanding it is crucial for achieving financial success.</p>
<p>Imagine two job offers: one with a monthly salary of 100,000 yuan, and another starting at 1 yuan in the first month, doubling each subsequent month.  Assuming both jobs last two years (24 months), which would you choose?</p>
<p>At first glance, the first offer seems better.  100,000 yuan monthly yields 2.4 million yuan over 24 months. However, anyone understanding compound interest would choose the second job, which yields over 16.77 million yuan after 24 months! This is the effect of compounding. While this is an extreme example, such high growth rates are unlikely in reality.  Nevertheless, it clearly demonstrates the power of compound interest.</p>
<p>Most people have a basic understanding of compound interest.  Depositing money in a bank generates interest over time, a common understanding in modern society. Since Einstein considered compound interest the most powerful force, and it can help us become millionaires with modest investments, a deeper understanding of its workings is essential, especially for those interested in financial management.</p>
<p>Simply put, compound interest is &ldquo;interest on interest.&rdquo; We know bank deposits earn interest, calculated using compound interest. For instance, with a 10% interest rate, a 1,000 yuan deposit earns 100 yuan in interest in the first year, resulting in 1,100 yuan.  If left in the bank, the second year&rsquo;s interest is 110 yuan (on 1,100 yuan), totaling 1,210 yuan. The third year yields 121 yuan in interest, reaching 1,331 yuan.</p>
<p>Notice the increasing interest earned each year.  This is because the first year&rsquo;s interest earns interest in the second year, and so on, leading to an ever-increasing return.  This &ldquo;interest on interest&rdquo; phenomenon is compound interest.</p>
<p>The table below shows that after the 26th year, the annual interest earned surpasses the principal, and by the 40th year, the interest of 4,114 yuan is more than four times the initial 1,000 yuan principal.</p>

<p>Compound interest&rsquo;s effect varies with different interest rates and durations.  These variations are presented in compound interest tables (refer to this appendix).  These tables, composed of interest rates, years, and future value factors (the growth multiplier calculated by the formula), might seem daunting with their numerous figures. However, understanding them is invaluable for investment and financial management.  Renowned American financial advisor Venita VanCaspel calls the compound interest table the &ldquo;eighth wonder of the world.&rdquo; If you don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to travel the world, studying this table can be just as rewarding.  Understanding the characteristics of compound interest is key to leveraging its power for wealth creation.</p>
<p>The compound interest table reveals that the values increase with time and interest rate.  However, this isn&rsquo;t the whole story.  Observing compound interest graphs derived from these tables reveals further insights. Figure 1-1 assumes a yearly deposit of 1 yuan at different interest rates, plotting asset growth over 10 years. Figure 1-2 uses the same assumptions but extends the time horizon to 40 years.</p>

</p>
<p>Figure 1-2: Future Value Growth of 1 Yuan Annuity at Different Interest Rates over 40 Years</p>
<p>These graphs illustrate the growth of 1 yuan over time at various interest rates and durations. Comparing them reveals two key characteristics of compound interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As the duration (time) increases, the future value rises continuously, and the rate of increase accelerates. This is known as exponential growth.  Given sufficient time, the growth becomes dramatic, with the curve eventually approaching a straight upward line.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Different interest rates result in significantly different growth curves.  Over decades, the disparity between high and low interest rate curves becomes immense.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the secret to accumulating significant wealth from small beginnings lies in leveraging the &ldquo;money making money&rdquo; power of compound interest.  Compounding has two key features: its effect is more pronounced over longer periods, and higher returns amplify its impact. Applying these principles to investing leads to two conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Invest in high-return assets like stocks and real estate. Higher returns maximize the effect of compounding, while low returns yield minimal benefits.  To fully harness the power of compound interest, capital must be invested in high-return assets.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Hold investments long-term.  The longer the investment horizon, the more significant the compounding effect.  Short-term investments don&rsquo;t allow sufficient time for compounding to work its magic.  Therefore, long-term holdings in high-return assets are crucial for maximizing the benefits of compound interest.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone&rsquo;s age, personality, and applicable tax rates differ.  Therefore, each individual needs a tailored approach to wealth accumulation. I can&rsquo;t provide personalized financial planning advice based on your specific circumstances, nor can I encompass everyone&rsquo;s financial situation and plans with a few generic examples.</p>
<p>To help you design your own &ldquo;Blueprint for Financial Success,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve combined the future value and annuity future value formulas from finance to create a universal &ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula.&rdquo;  This formula empowers readers to plan their lifelong financial strategies based on their unique circumstances and objectives.</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mtable displaystyle="true" columnalign="right center left" columnspacing="0 thickmathspace" rowspacing="3pt"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Future Wealth</mtext></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>Current Wealth</mtext><mo>×</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>R</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mi>n</mi></msup><mo>+</mo><mtext>Annual Savings</mtext><mo>×</mo><mfrac><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>R</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mi>n</mi></msup><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>R</mi></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>Current Wealth</mtext><mo>×</mo><mtext>Future Value Factor</mtext><mo>+</mo><mtext>Annual Savings</mtext><mo>×</mo><mtext>Annuity Future Value Factor</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>Where:</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mi>n</mi></mtd><mtd><mo>:</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>Number of years</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mi>R</mi></mtd><mtd><mo>:</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>Average annual investment rate of return</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></p>
<p>The values for the complex calculations in the formula above (Future Value Factor and Annuity Future Value Factor) can be found in Appendix 1 of this book.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Future Value Factor:</strong> The future value of 1 yuan today, after N years, at an interest rate (or rate of return) of R%.</li>
<li><strong>Annuity Future Value Factor:</strong> The future value of an annuity of 1 yuan deposited at the end of each year, after N years, at an interest rate (or rate of return) of R%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using this formula, you can project your future wealth by inputting your current assets, average annual savings for investment, planned investment period, and expected annual rate of return. You can calculate the result or look it up in a table.</p>
<p>This formula simplifies the real-world situation, as investment returns are unlikely to remain constant each year, and annual savings might fluctuate.  However, using the &ldquo;average&rdquo; annual rate of return and &ldquo;average&rdquo; annual investment amount generally provides a reasonable approximation of future wealth.</p>
<p>The purpose of the &ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t to predict future wealth precisely but to illustrate how investment builds wealth and how financial management leads to prosperity. It aims to bolster your confidence in financial planning, enabling you to focus on key principles, maintain perseverance, and steadily progress towards your financial goals throughout market fluctuations.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a foolproof formula for riches. Following this method may lead to becoming a millionaire, but success isn&rsquo;t guaranteed.  However, inaction guarantees zero chance of success. The most valuable aspect of this wealth-building concept is the message: &ldquo;Investment and financial management can lead to wealth.&rdquo; This knowledge fosters optimism and hope. Regardless of your current wealth, age, annual savings, or investment skills, with dedication, determination, and a willingness to learn, you can leverage investing to grow your wealth.</p>
<p>After understanding this formula, follow these steps for financial planning:</p>
<p><strong>I. Data Collection:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What is your current total asset value? (Include bank deposits, stocks, real estate, etc.)</li>
<li>How much do you anticipate saving annually for investment?</li>
<li>What is your expected average annual investment rate of return?</li>
<li>How many years do you plan to invest before reaching your financial goal?</li>
<li>What is your future wealth target?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>II. Calculation and Analysis:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Use the five data points above with the &ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula&rdquo; to assess the feasibility of your wealth plan. If it&rsquo;s not feasible, how will you adjust? Will you increase savings? Improve investment skills to boost returns? Lower your wealth target? Or extend your time horizon? Adjust the variables and recalculate until you find a realistic and achievable plan.</li>
<li>Calculate your projected accumulated wealth based on your current assets, investment period, annual savings, and expected rate of return.</li>
<li>You can also use any four of the five variables (current wealth, target year, annual savings, rate of return, wealth target) to calculate the remaining variable. (Calculating the target year or rate of return using the other four variables requires a financial calculator or trial and error to find an approximate value.)</li>
</ol>
<p>While the &ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula&rdquo; involves a seemingly complex mathematical formula, its primary purpose is to explain the principles of wealth building, not to complicate financial management or confuse readers. If you don&rsquo;t have a calculator or prefer not to delve into the formula&rsquo;s calculations, feel free to disregard it.</p>
<p>Using the &ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula&rdquo; can help you plan your future finances and boost your confidence in financial management. However, it doesn&rsquo;t guarantee investment success.  Pre-planning is just the beginning; the key lies in mastering investment principles and consistent action. When starting your financial journey, clarify your financial situation, set realistic wealth goals, then use the &ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula&rdquo; to evaluate your investment strategy and timeline. Remember, the path to wealth is in your hands.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Zhang San is 30 years old with 200,000 yuan in savings. After reading this book, he resolves to become a millionaire (meaning having 100 million yuan).  He plans to invest 100,000 yuan annually in stocks and real estate with an expected 20% annual return, aiming to reach his goal by age 50.  Let&rsquo;s use the &ldquo;Investment Wealth Formula&rdquo; to assess the feasibility.</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mtable displaystyle="true" columnalign="right center left" columnspacing="0 thickmathspace" rowspacing="3pt"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Future Wealth</mtext></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>200,000</mn><mo>×</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>20</mn></mrow></msup><mo>+</mo><mn>100,000</mn><mo>×</mo><mfrac><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>20</mn></mrow></msup><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></mrow></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>200,000</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>38.338</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>100,000</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>228.98</mn><mspace width="1em"></mspace><mtext>(Corrected Annuity Factor)</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>30,435,600</mn><mspace width="1em"></mspace><mtext>(Corrected Calculation)</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></p>
<p>Based on the calculation, Zhang San&rsquo;s 200,000 yuan initial investment, along with 100,000 yuan annual investments over 20 years at a 20% average return, will yield approximately 26 million yuan, less than one-third of his 100 million yuan goal.  To become a millionaire, he can improve his return, increase his annual investment, or extend his time horizon.  A 20% return is already quite good and realistic, even for seasoned investors.  Increasing his returns further might be challenging.  Since he doesn&rsquo;t want to extend the timeline, he decides to increase his annual investment. Through frugality and a part-time job, he manages to save 200,000 yuan annually. Let&rsquo;s recalculate his future wealth after 20 years.</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mtable displaystyle="true" columnalign="right center left" columnspacing="0 thickmathspace" rowspacing="3pt"><mtr><mtd><mrow><mo>Future Wealth</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>200000</mn><mo>×</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>20</mn></mrow></msup><mo>+</mo><mn>200000</mn><mo>×</mo><mfrac><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>20</mn></mrow></msup><mrow><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>200000</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>38.338</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>200000</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>186.96</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>45005600</mn></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></p>
<p>Even with doubled annual savings, his wealth after 20 years still falls short of half his goal.  With both his 20% return and 200,000 yuan annual investment maxed out, he has to extend his timeline. He decides to aim for 25 years.  Let&rsquo;s calculate his projected wealth then.</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mtable displaystyle="true" columnalign="right center left" columnspacing="0 thickmathspace" rowspacing="3pt"><mtr><mtd><mrow><mo>Future Wealth</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>200000</mn><mo>×</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>25</mn></mrow></msup><mo>+</mo><mn>200000</mn><mo>×</mo><mfrac><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>25</mn></mrow></msup><mrow><mn>20</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>200000</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>95.396</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>200000</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>471.98</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>113475200</mn></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></p>
<p>He finally achieves his goal of becoming a millionaire after 25 years.  Extending the timeline by just five years makes a significant difference. With a longer time horizon, his required annual investment could be even lower. This example validates the book&rsquo;s emphasis on &ldquo;youth being an asset in wealth building&rdquo; and &ldquo;the importance of long-term investing for realizing the power of compound interest.&rdquo;  Experiment with different variables to understand their impact.  <strong>You&rsquo;ll discover that the initial wealth and annual investment amount have a relatively small impact, while time and rate of return are the key drivers of wealth accumulation.</strong></p>
<p>Your circumstances might be better or worse than Zhang San&rsquo;s. Regardless, everyone has different starting points, but anyone can become a millionaire.  Calculate your own path to becoming a millionaire based on your current situation. Remember, with a modest initial investment, allocation to high-return assets like stocks and real estate, and long-term holding, becoming a millionaire is absolutely achievable.</p>
<p>Now, set your financial goal. Write down your target wealth, your desired timeline, and how you plan to use your wealth to achieve your broader life goals.</p>
<p><strong>Remember: &ldquo;Money is a means to an end, not the end itself.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Accumulating more money isn&rsquo;t always better, and having more financial goals isn&rsquo;t necessarily advantageous.  Such an approach may prevent you from ever reaching your goals and trap you in a cycle of dissatisfaction and greed. You could become a slave to money and potentially harm future generations with excessive wealth, contributing nothing to yourself, your loved ones, or society.</p>
<p>Once you have a financial goal, use the &ldquo;Wealth Formula&rdquo; to calculate your path, including required annual savings and average rate of return. This will inform your investment strategy and timeline. More importantly, determine how you will utilize your wealth once you achieve your goal.  This concretizes your aspirations. You&rsquo;ll discover that by applying the principles in this book and remaining consistent, becoming a millionaire is within reach. A clear goal leads to a happier life, and a positive attitude contributes to success in all areas of life.</p>

<p>The path to wealth through investment relies on &ldquo;making money with money.&rdquo;  Therefore, the prerequisite for investment is having capital.  A common dilemma faced by individuals when investing is, &ldquo;What if I don&rsquo;t have enough money?&rdquo; This can lead to missed opportunities. This book proposes a solution: &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have enough money, but someone else does and is willing to lend it to you, then borrow it.&rdquo; This is the highest realm of investment management—leveraged investing.</p>
<p><strong>Chen Youhao, President of the Tuntex Group: The Money-Making Method of Borrowing and Rolling</strong></p>
<p>Starting in the textile industry, Chen Youhao used financial leverage to rapidly expand the Tuntex Group into chemical fibers, construction, cement, hotels, petrochemicals, and other fields. With over 30 affiliated companies, it became one of the top 15 largest corporate groups in Taiwan. He also planned to invest nearly 7 billion USD in Taiwan and Thailand to expand chemical fiber plants.</p>
<p>Tuntex&rsquo;s growth never stopped, and its debt continued to rise. In 1995, Tuntex Group&rsquo;s core business, Tonwin Construction, had total assets of 59.6 billion TWD, revenue of 15.7 billion TWD, and net profit after tax of 2.6 billion TWD, but its debt ratio was still as high as 60.99%.</p>
<p>A graduate of the Department of Economics at National Taiwan University, Chen Youhao always prided himself on his sophisticated money-making method of borrowing and rolling. He had full confidence in Tuntex&rsquo;s financial management. His financial principles were: 1/3 self-owned capital, the rest borrowed from financial institutions; current assets must be greater than current liabilities, with a current ratio greater than 100%; and the ratio of self-owned capital to debt must not exceed 1/2.</p>
<p>Chen Youhao emphasized that whenever the company&rsquo;s debt ratio approached its limit, he would strictly control it, so the company&rsquo;s financial situation remained normal. However, whenever the construction industry was in a downturn, Tuntex would be plagued by rumors of financial difficulties. In June 1995, due to capital needs, Chen Youhao pledged 46.5 million shares of Tonwin, setting a record for the highest number of shares pledged by directors and supervisors that month. Chen Youhao repeatedly assured the public that Tuntex&rsquo;s finances were absolutely sound.</p>
<p>Despite the rumors damaging the company&rsquo;s image, Chen Youhao firmly believed that reasonable borrowing could enable the company to earn more profits. He was also confident that businesses funded by loans would be profitable because the return on investment was higher than the interest rate on loans.</p>
<p><strong>Is Borrowing to Invest Wrong?</strong></p>
<p>Is borrowing money for investment appropriate? Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet, &ldquo;Neither a borrower nor a lender be.&rdquo; This was once considered a golden rule. Our elders often warned their children not to borrow money from others or lend money to others; borrowing was not considered respectable and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Indeed, most stories of financial ruin are caused by debt, such as the cases of Tsai Chen-chou of the Tenth Credit Cooperative and the stock market tycoon Lei Borong. Countless examples of bankruptcy caused by debt make people fear and avoid it.</p>
<p>However, among the famous wealthy individuals we know, such as Wang Yongqing, Kao Ching-yuan, Chang Yung-fa, and Wu Ho-Su, who didn&rsquo;t rely on borrowing to invest in their journey from rags to riches? The answer is &ldquo;none.&rdquo; Moreover, the more successful people are at making money, the more they tend to borrow. Looking at the financial statements of listed companies, are there any renowned high-performing enterprises in Taiwan, such as Formosa Plastics, Uni-President, and Evergreen, that have zero debt?  The message is clear: successful tycoons, like successful businesses, rarely achieve their wealth without using other people&rsquo;s money. In business management, appropriate borrowing is not only necessary but also reasonable.</p>
<p>If Shakespeare were alive in the 21st century and understood how capitalism works and how people become wealthy, he might change his words to: &ldquo;If you have no money, but others do and are willing to lend it to you, then borrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After reviewing these characteristics of success, reflect on your own financial situation. What percentage of your investment funds comes from borrowing? If, like most people, 100% of your investments are made with your own funds, you are overlooking an important tool for building wealth: borrowing.</p>
<p><strong>Borrowing is a Crucial Tool for Wealth Creation</strong></p>
<p>American investment consultant Robert Allen repeatedly emphasizes in his bestselling book <em>Creating Wealth</em>: &ldquo;You cannot become rich by investing without borrowing.&rdquo; I disagree with this argument. The examples in Chapter 1 of this book clearly demonstrate that with proper financial management, one can become a billionaire without relying on borrowed investments.  The American investment master Warren Buffett does not advocate leveraged investing.  Without debt, he is a prime example of building wealth solely through his own funds. However, there is a prerequisite for accumulating wealth using only your own funds: long-term patient waiting. Warren Buffett only rose to prominence after three to four decades of investing.</p>
<p>Although Robert Allen&rsquo;s argument that &ldquo;you cannot become rich without borrowing&rdquo; is incorrect, I must admit that the &ldquo;leveraged investing&rdquo; he advocates is an important means of building wealth, especially for those who want to accelerate the speed of wealth creation.  Leveraged investing is a tool that should not be ignored.</p>
<p>In conclusion, whether you want to accelerate wealth accumulation or can tolerate the pressure of leveraged investing, you must understand the nature and impact of leveraged investing before deciding if this tool is right for you.</p>

</h3>
<p>In Taiwan, there are quite a few entrepreneurs skilled in financial leverage. Besides Chen Youhao, the president of the Tuntex Group, Weng Damming, the head of the Hualon Group, is also a master of this art.</p>
<p>Weng Damming, the head of the Hualon Group, became a highly controversial figure due to his unconventional style. After the death of his father, Weng Mingchang, Weng Damming shouldered the heavy responsibility of reviving the family business.  Starting in textiles, the Hualon Group owned Hualon Textile, Hualon Microelectronics, Yixin Trading, Jiashin Livestock, and Kuo Hua Life Insurance, among other affiliated companies.</p>
<p>Weng Damming adopted a high-leverage approach to business management. In 1994, the Hualon Group had total assets of 130 billion TWD and debts as high as over 50 billion TWD, of which over 30 billion TWD were short-term debts.  He used the stocks or real estate of affiliated companies as collateral for bank loans, with a pledge ratio of nearly 60%. Therefore, during the stock market crash and the real estate downturn, Weng Damming was troubled by rumors of financial difficulties.  Due to the sluggish stock and real estate markets, the collateral value of the Hualon Group was insufficient, requiring him to supplement the collateral or face the pressure of being &ldquo;liquidated.&rdquo; However, the seasoned Weng Damming, with his flexible financial management, once again demonstrated that the financial crisis was just a false alarm.</p>
<p>As Hualon Textile, the parent company of the Hualon Group, enjoyed stable profits and increased earnings with the gradual recovery of the textile industry, Weng Damming was able to borrow money fearlessly and aggressively expand into new businesses.  With a gambler&rsquo;s mentality, Weng Damming can be said to have maximized the principle of financial leverage. The story of this legendary figure shows us both the rewards and risks of leveraged investing.</p>
<p><strong>The Principle of Financial Leverage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Act within your means; don&rsquo;t over-leverage, or you risk being shaken out.</li>
</ul>
<p>In finance, borrowing is known as &ldquo;financial leverage.&rdquo; Simply put, leverage is the principle of using a small force to achieve a large effect. Humans discovered the power of leverage early on and used it to move or lift heavy objects. The ancients used the principle of leverage to create magnificent engineering marvels such as the Great Wall and the pyramids. Modern wealthy individuals use the principle of financial leverage to create immense fortunes. Archimedes once said, &ldquo;Give me a place to stand, and I shall move the earth.&rdquo;  In investment management, financial leverage implies: &ldquo;Lend me enough money, and I can make any large investment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leveraged investing involves borrowing other people&rsquo;s money to make larger investments, thus utilizing the leverage effect.  Proper use of leverage can turn small amounts of money into large profits. Conversely, improper use can also lead to significant losses with small amounts of money. Here&rsquo;s an example to help readers understand how financial leverage works. Suppose you buy a house with 10 million in cash. A year later, you are fortunate enough to sell it for 13 million, making a 30% profit (R1). If you only paid 3 million in cash for the house and borrowed the remaining 7 million from the bank at a 10% interest rate, and then sold it for 13 million a year later, your profit margin would increase to 77% (R2).  Conversely, if the house price unfortunately drops by 30% after a year, and you sell it for 7 million, the person who bought it entirely in cash would lose 30% (R3). The investor who borrowed 7 million would see their loss expand to 123% (R4), meaning not only is the original investment lost, but they are also in debt. The calculation of the above rates of return is as follows:</p>

<p>From the above example, we can clearly see how debt leverage exerts the power of &ldquo;using a small force to achieve a large effect.&rdquo; <strong>When the return on investment is higher than the interest rate on the loan, leveraged investing will increase the return on investment. When the return on investment is lower than the interest rate on the loan, the return on investment will decrease due to the borrowing.</strong></p>
<p>The main reason for the leverage effect is that loan interest is a cost that must be paid under any circumstances. Regardless of the investment return, the interest cost of borrowing remains fixed. Therefore, when the investment return is greater than the loan cost, the excess profit belongs to the borrower, creating a positive leverage effect and naturally increasing the return on investment of the principal. However, when the investment return is less than the loan interest cost, the borrower must bear the difference, resulting in a negative leverage effect, which reduces the return on the principal. This is especially true when the investment incurs a loss, as the borrowing cost will magnify the loss.</p>

It can also cause you to fall hard.</p></blockquote>


<h3 class="relative group">Two Major Principles of Borrowing 
    <div id="two-major-principles-of-borrowing" class="anchor"></div>
    
    <span
        class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100">
        <a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700"

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<p>Financial leverage is like a seesaw: it can lift you very high or cause you to fall hard, depending on whether the leverage effect is positive or negative.  The key factor determining the direction of the leverage effect is which is higher: the return on investment or the interest rate on the loan. If the return on investment is greater than the interest rate, the leverage effect is positive. Conversely, if the return on investment is lower than the interest rate, the leverage effect becomes detrimental.</p>
<p><strong>Return on Investment Must Be Higher Than the Interest Rate</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, when deciding whether to use leveraged investing, the first things to consider are: What is the purpose of the loan? What is the expected return on investment for the target investment? Is it higher than the loan interest rate? If the return on investment of the targeted investment is significantly lower than the borrowing rate, the idea of leveraged investing should be dismissed early on. Otherwise, the result will certainly be detrimental rather than beneficial. If you can&rsquo;t understand what the expected return on investment is or whether the return is higher than the interest rate, then I advise you to understand these issues before borrowing!</p>
<p>Debt is synonymous with risk. Increasing debt increases risk and the possibility of personal or family bankruptcy. There are two major principles of leveraged investing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The expected return on investment must be greater than the interest rate on the loan. For example, if the loan interest rate is 11%, it&rsquo;s only worthwhile if the after-tax return on investment is above 11%.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>In the worst-case scenario, your cash income must be sufficient to cover the principal and interest payments. For instance, if the investment price falls instead of rises after a few years, you must have enough cash income to repay the principal and interest on time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, investors must keep in mind that leveraged investing should not be based on the expectation that the price of the investment target will definitely rise, but rather on the preparation for a price drop.  Therefore, you should only engage in leveraged investing if you can still afford the interest payments even if the price continues to fall. You must also be able to withstand the psychological pressure that comes with leveraged investing.</p>
<p><strong>Avoiding Improper Borrowing</strong></p>
<p>Some readers may feel smug after reading this section because they are already engaged in what they consider leveraged investing. Upon further inquiry, however, it turns out they are borrowing money to buy lottery tickets, futures, or other speculative products, or even taking out loans to purchase consumer goods.  I must emphasize that these actions do not constitute proper &ldquo;leveraged investing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Futures markets, margin trading (such as foreign exchange and bonds), or any gambling activities like lotteries and horse racing all have negative expected returns.  Long-term participation will inevitably lead to financial ruin.  Coupled with the deadly effect of borrowing, the result will undoubtedly be rapid bankruptcy.  Therefore, no matter how alluring these games are, remember:  It&rsquo;s okay to indulge occasionally for recreational purposes, but never borrow money to participate, or you will accelerate your path to bankruptcy with dire consequences.</p>
<p>Another point to remind readers of is to avoid borrowing money to purchase consumer goods. Borrowing to consume is like using future money to create &ldquo;false wealth.&rdquo; Unless absolutely necessary, the concept of borrowing for consumption should be avoided. Otherwise, the family&rsquo;s financial situation will be burdened.</p>
<p>For banks, consumer loans are extremely risky and require high interest rates.  Generally, consumer loan interest rates are above 10%.  Readers should understand that high-return investments have an amazing compounding effect.  Similarly, high-interest loans also have a dramatic compounding effect.  Take car loans, for example.  Assuming a 20% loan interest rate, after three and a half years, you will have to repay double the amount. This means that if you borrow money to buy a car now, three and a half years later, not only will the original car have depreciated significantly, but you will effectively have to pay for two new cars of the same model.  My advice on car loans is: don&rsquo;t take them. Wait until you can afford to pay in cash. Car loan interest rates are usually very high, often exceeding 15%, although there are occasional promotional periods with lower rates.  Fundamentally, except for commercial vehicles, cars are consumer goods with no investment return.  From an investment perspective, borrowing for car purchases is highly inadvisable.</p>
<p><strong>Uncontrolled Consumer Lending Easily Leads to Bankruptcy</strong></p>
<p>Credit cards, now a ubiquitous form of plastic currency worldwide, are also a typical example of consumer loans.  Since the popularization of credit cards, consumer behavior has undergone significant changes. While credit cards offer great convenience, their widespread use has led to a surge in bankruptcy cases among American families, with outstanding credit card debt exceeding 700 billion USD.  Some may wonder: how can credit cards lead to bankruptcy if you only spend what you have?  In fact, from a borrowing perspective, credit cards have an irresistible allure.</p>
<p>The greatest temptation of credit card borrowing lies in its simplicity.  With just a signature, you can make purchases in advance and even borrow cash from the bank, subtly inflating your spending power.  Remember: when using credit cards, never spend more than you can afford to repay each month.  Credit card interest rates are often above 20%, so you should always pay off your credit card balance promptly.  My advice is: &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t control your spending urges, it&rsquo;s best not to apply for a credit card. If you apply for one for convenience, never use it for the sake of credit.  Use it only when it truly offers convenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While using credit cards for borrowing is convenient, those who entertain this idea should first understand the destructive power of a 20% interest rate. As mentioned earlier, if you save 14,000 per year and invest it in an investment tool with a 20% annual return, after 40 years, the 560,000 invested will grow to 102.81 million due to the power of compounding. Similarly, if someone borrows 14,000 per year on a credit card for 40 years, totaling 560,000, with a 20% interest rate, they will have to repay the bank 102.81 million after 40 years. This explains why the prevalence of credit card debt in the United States has historically led to numerous bankruptcies.</p>
<p>Another common type of loan is a mortgage.  Generally, mortgages are a sound form of leveraged investing because, in the long run, the average return on real estate is above 20%, while typical mortgage interest rates are around 10%, which meets the first principle of leveraged investing: the expected return on investment is higher than the interest rate on the loan. Whether it meets the second principle depends on the purchase conditions. In recent years, with the real estate market downturn and oversupply, some pre-sale housing promotions offer &ldquo;70% financing,&rdquo; allowing you to own a 10 million house with only a 3 million down payment. This is quite appealing, but investors often overlook the fact that while borrowing 7 million sounds great, they must be able to afford the monthly principal and interest payments of over 70,000. Without considering this, there is a risk of foreclosure and being forced to sell at a low price within months of purchase, suffering losses before enjoying any benefits of leveraged investing. Therefore, when purchasing real estate with borrowed funds, careful calculations must be made beforehand to choose a suitable house price that does not jeopardize the family&rsquo;s normal living expenses.</p>
<p>Although the initial burden of a mortgage is heavy, it becomes lighter over time as work experience and salary increase.  If you wait until you have saved enough money to buy a house, you might miss the opportunity entirely due to the rapid appreciation of house prices. Therefore, <strong>young people without real estate should consider buying a house as an investment. It not only forces them to save but also effectively combats inflation. Moreover, they can utilize the principle of financial leverage, using the bank&rsquo;s money to expand their credit and accumulate wealth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How Much Debt Should You Take On?</strong></p>
<p>If you decide to use leveraged investing, the next question is: how much debt should you take on? This is a crucial question. Too much debt carries high risks, while too little debt fails to fully utilize the potential of making money with other people&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>How much debt should a family take on?  Like &ldquo;how much debt should a company have,&rdquo; this is a question without a precise answer. In practice, it depends on the specific circumstances of each family. However, one thing is certain: if a family has the capacity to borrow but chooses not to, it is being too conservative and not managing its finances optimally. Conversely, excessive borrowing is too dangerous.  Before taking on debt, each family should consider its actual situation and make a wise judgment about its debt level.  As for how much to borrow, I recommend considering the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Income Stability:  Loan interest must be paid on time regardless of investment performance. If your income source is unstable, you may not be able to make regular interest payments, making high-leverage investments unsuitable. Similar to companies with stable income, they have a greater capacity to utilize more debt.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Personal Assets: Borrowing from financial institutions requires tangible assets as collateral. Therefore, owning more assets suitable as collateral allows for larger leveraged investments.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>Return on Investment: Other things being equal, the higher the return on investment, the greater the benefits of financial leverage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>Inflation Rate: Borrowing is more advantageous during periods of high inflation, as inflation allows you to repay debt with less valuable money.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="5">
<li>Risk Tolerance: Everyone has a different risk tolerance, related to personality and individual circumstances. Those with low risk tolerance should not over-leverage, even if it could lead to large profits, as the stress could take a toll.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="6">
<li>Market Interest Rate Levels: Generally, when market interest rates fall and bank funds are ample, not only is it easier for investors to borrow money, but the benefits of financial leverage are also greater. Therefore, falling interest rates present an opportune time for investors to consider leveraged investing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the function of a bank to you? Many people believe banks are for saving money. However, for those who truly understand investment management, banks are not a place to save money, but a source of borrowing.</p>
<p><strong>The function of a bank is to provide a place for those who are not good at managing money to save, so that those who are good at it can use that money to invest and make profits.</strong> Suppose someone deposits 14,000 per year into a bank at a 5% interest rate. After 40 years, the bank will owe this depositor 1.69 million. On the other hand, if an investor borrows 14,000 per year from the same bank at the same 5% interest rate and invests that money in stocks or real estate, achieving an average annual return of 20%, after 40 years, their investment would grow to 102.81 million, while they only need to repay the bank 1.69 million. In other words, the 101.12 million gained was made by utilizing the money of bank depositors.</p>
<p><strong>How to Build Credit</strong></p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s highly developed financial markets, there are numerous financing channels for businesses. However, for individuals, banks remain the primary source of borrowing.  Maintaining a close relationship with the bank and earning their trust is crucial for building personal credit.</p>
<p>Credit is the ability to borrow.  A person with high credit not only demonstrates a strong ability to repay loans but also indicates wealth. How do you build credit?  As the saying goes, &ldquo;Loan and repay, and borrowing again is easy.&rdquo; The first rule of building credit is to borrow money and repay it on time. Some people, to establish their creditworthiness (the ability to borrow), even borrow small sums of money for seemingly frivolous reasons, just to build a good borrowing record so they can borrow larger amounts in the future.</p>
<p>Discard the outdated notion that &ldquo;borrowing is not respectable.&rdquo; In the past, only those in dire financial straits would borrow money. Nowadays, such individuals can at most borrow small amounts from relatives and friends.  They would likely be unable to borrow a cent from a bank.  Today, those who can borrow from banks are typically wealthy individuals.</p>
<p>Based on current bank loan approval standards, without sufficient assets as collateral or evidence of stable future income and repayment ability, can anyone borrow money? Therefore, when I hear about someone heavily in debt, my first question is whether the source of the debt is banks or private loans.  If the source is entirely from banks, my immediate thought is: &ldquo;This person must be wealthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Borrowing: A Double-Edged Sword</strong></p>
<p>Those who don&rsquo;t borrow cannot go bankrupt; similarly, those who don&rsquo;t borrow can hardly become immensely wealthy in a short period.  &ldquo;Debt&rdquo; appears in the lives of both the most successful and the most unsuccessful. While many wealthy individuals utilize debt to become rich, many poor people are ruined by misusing debt. Borrowing is a double-edged sword. Used correctly, it is a significant aid to investment and wealth creation. Used improperly, its destructive power can lead to complete ruin.  Prudence is essential when using it. It&rsquo;s like a double-edged sword that can save or harm, depending on how it&rsquo;s wielded.</p>
<p>I advise against rushing into leveraged investing before fully understanding its principles.  First, understand the nature of leveraged investing and carefully consider whether to use borrowing for investment.  Before borrowing, thoroughly understand how leveraged investing works. Only then can you truly achieve the goal of making money with other people&rsquo;s money without harming yourself.</p>

<p>Li Ka-shing, ranked among the top ten wealthiest Chinese in the world with a fortune of nearly $7 billion, is the chairman of Cheung Kong Holdings and Hutchison Whampoa Limited in Hong Kong. His legendary journey to wealth and his influence in Hong Kong&rsquo;s political and business circles have earned him another nickname — &ldquo;Superman Li.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Capitalizing on the Plunging Property Market</strong></p>
<p>In 1939, 12-year-old Li Ka-shing moved to Hong Kong from his hometown of Chao&rsquo;an, Guangdong, with his father. After two years of schooling, Hong Kong fell due to the Pacific War. The following year, his father died of a serious illness, forcing Li Ka-shing, the eldest son, to drop out of school and support his family. After Hong Kong&rsquo;s liberation in 1945, he ended his odd-job career and became a salesman at a plastics factory, working over 16 hours a day. Three years later, at the age of 20, he was promoted to general manager. Two years after that, he used all his savings of HK$7,000 to start his own small plastics factory, &ldquo;Cheung Kong Industries,&rdquo; the predecessor of today&rsquo;s largest conglomerate in Hong Kong, Cheung Kong Holdings.</p>
<p>How did Li Ka-shing, without even a primary school diploma, take his first step toward becoming the richest man by producing plastic flowers? In 1958, due to a rent increase by the landlord of his factory, Li Ka-shing bought a piece of land in North Point and built his own factory. In the early 1960s, the plastic flower industry declined, and in 1967, Hong Kong property prices plummeted. Li Ka-shing seized the opportunity to acquire land at low prices. In 1972, the Hong Kong stock market soared, and Cheung Kong Industries went public, taking advantage of the opportunity to raise capital from the public to purchase more land. In the 10 years following the completion of his first factory in 1958, his real estate holdings increased 50-fold. Cheung Kong now holds approximately 1.48 million square meters of floor space. Li Ka-shing has been investing in real estate for over 40 years, and long-term investment has accumulated his enormous wealth.</p>
<p>Having strived for 50 years and achieved success in wealth accumulation, Li Ka-shing has unique insights into success. He said: &ldquo;Before the age of 20, 100% of career success comes from hard work; between 20 and 30, when a career has some foundation, 10% of success depends on good luck, and 90% still comes from diligence; after 30, the proportion of opportunity gradually increases; now, luck accounts for about 30% to 40%.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same applies to wealth accumulation. Before 20, all money comes from hard work; between 20 and 30 is the time to work hard to earn and save money; after 30, the importance of investment and financial management gradually increases. By middle age, the money earned is less important, and how to manage money becomes more critical. Li Ka-shing has been fighting for his wealth all his life. To become rich, one must have enough patience.</p>
<p><strong>The Power of Compound Interest Takes Time</strong></p>
<p>Many people who have heard my lectures often ask the same questions: &ldquo;Saving 14,000 yuan a year to become a billionaire is indeed impressive, but according to your method, it takes 40 years, which is really discouraging!&rdquo; &ldquo;It takes 40 years to become a billionaire. By then, I might be dead. What&rsquo;s the point of having billions then?&rdquo; &ldquo;Can you teach some secrets to getting rich quickly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even I feel that 40 years is too long. At the repeated requests of the audience, I did spend some time studying this issue in depth. The result of the research is: <strong>Financial management requires a long time, and the effect is not visible in the short term.  It is impossible to get rich quickly through financial management.</strong></p>
<p>If someone starts now and saves 14,000 yuan at the end of each year, and if the money saved each year can be invested in stocks or real estate with an average annual return of 20%, we know that the wealth will grow to 102.81 million yuan after 40 years. Now, let&rsquo;s ask: How much wealth can he accumulate after 10 years? Most people think that with such a high return, even with a shorter time, after 10 years of compounding, it should be at least 5 million yuan, some even guess 10 million, and the most conservative guess is 1 million.  Similarly, this is a surprising answer: 360,000 yuan! The following calculation formula should be familiar to readers, but they will be surprised that the amount is so small.</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mtable displaystyle="true" columnalign="right center left" columnspacing="0 thickmathspace" rowspacing="3pt"><mtr><mtd><mn>14,000</mn><mo>×</mo><mfrac><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0.20</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow></msup><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mn>0.20</mn></mfrac></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>360,000</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mn>14,000</mn><mo>×</mo><mfrac><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0.20</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>40</mn></mrow></msup><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mn>0.20</mn></mfrac></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>102,810,000</mn></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></p>
<p>With the same 20% return, 14,000 yuan per year results in 102.81 million yuan after 40 years of financial management, but only 360,000 yuan after 10 years, which is unbelievable! The difference is more than 300 times! Fortunately, this concept is presented to readers in a timely manner. Otherwise, if readers use the methods mentioned in this book, save 14,000 yuan every year, and invest all of it in stocks, thinking that they can become billionaires, they would be shocked to find that after ten years of hard work, with an average annual return of 20%, they have only accumulated 360,000 yuan! They might feel cheated.  After struggling for 10 years, they can&rsquo;t even afford a car, let alone become billionaires!</p>
<p>What is 10 years? Ten years is a long time. After 10 years of struggle, there&rsquo;s only a little over 300,000 yuan. How discouraging! This is the frustration one inevitably encounters in the process of accumulating wealth through investment and financial management.  Investors must understand that financial management is a &ldquo;marathon&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;sprint.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s about endurance, not explosive power.</p>
<p>The prerequisite for getting rich through investment and financial management is time, and a long time. You must go through a very long waiting period before you can see the results. If the invested capital is small, no results will be seen after 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Earning Your Second 10 Million is Easier Than the First 1 Million</strong></p>
<p>Saving 14,000 yuan at the end of each year with an average investment return of 20%, even after 20 years, the assets will only accumulate to 2.61 million yuan.  At this point, one is still far from being a billionaire. It takes 30 years to accumulate 16.55 million yuan, barely reaching the millionaire level.  Only after 40 years of continuous struggle can one become a billionaire with 102.81 million yuan.</p>

<p>From the table above, we can see: by saving 14,000 yuan annually with a 20% investment return, the wealth increased by 360,000 yuan in the first decade, 2.25 million yuan in the second decade, 13.94 million yuan in the third decade, and 86.26 million yuan in the fourth decade. This is the characteristic of geometric progression, and it is also the principle that people engaged in investment and financial management should understand.  Therefore, three important characteristics of investment and financial management can be summarized here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Most wealth is created in the later stages. From the above example, we can see that only 41.28 million yuan was accumulated in the first 35 years, while 61.53 million yuan was created in the last 5 years.</li>

<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>In terms of amount, your ability to make money through financial management increases over time. From the table above, it can be seen that doing the same thing, the amount of money earned increases, the only thing needed is patience.</li>

<p>A self-made man who got rich by investing in stocks once told me: &ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;ve made it, a stock price increase can easily bring in millions of yuan. Making money has suddenly become so easy, it&rsquo;s unstoppable. Thinking back to the days when I first entered the stock market 30 years ago, it took a lot of hard work to earn tens of thousands of yuan. I really don&rsquo;t know where the money went back then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This experience is not unfamiliar to many who have struggled to build their fortunes from scratch.  Everything is difficult at the beginning.  During the initial struggle, money is hard to earn.  It takes a lot of effort to earn just tens of thousands of yuan. It&rsquo;s puzzling why money is so hard to earn.  Until success is achieved, and money comes rolling in, one wonders why making money has become so easy.</p>
<p><strong>Time is the Stepping Stone to Wealth Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>Everyone desires the ability to effortlessly earn their second million or ten million, reaching a state of abundant wealth.  The problem is, before earning the second million, you need to have the first million. But how can you earn the first million?  If you want to accumulate 1 million through investment and financial management, you need &ldquo;time.&rdquo; You have to go through a long period of hardship. If you can endure the difficult period of earning the first million, you can naturally enjoy the ease of earning the second million.</p>
<p>From the compound interest formula, we can see that time is an indispensable factor for compound interest to take effect.  Patient waiting is a prerequisite for investment and financial management.  Especially for wealth accumulation through financial management, the required patience is not a few months or years, but at least two or three decades, or even four or five decades.</p>
<p>The vast majority of wealthy people accumulate their huge fortunes gradually from small amounts of money over a long period. In the beginning, most people have very little capital, even negligible. However, success is woven from a series of small achievements. Great wealth is the accumulation of small wealth, coupled with the effect of compound interest.</p>
<p>The importance of time in investment and financial management is evident. Patience is essential for financial management. The more patient you are in enduring the long waiting period, the greater the power of wealth creation will be. This is the characteristic of &ldquo;compound interest.&rdquo; However, today we live in a &ldquo;fast food&rdquo; culture where everything emphasizes speed and efficiency: fast food restaurants for meals, express delivery for mail, highways for driving, one-hour photo processing, and crash courses for learning. People have become increasingly impatient and short-sighted, lacking patience.  In investment and financial management, they are also impatient and lack patience, wanting to see results immediately.  It may be more efficient to pursue speed in other matters, but investment and financial management cannot be rushed. Time is a necessary condition for financial management. The more you rush, the less you achieve.  Based on my observations, a common mistake among investors is giving up halfway. They get easily discouraged during bear markets and simply sell their stocks and real estate, completely leaving the stock and property markets, not knowing that lack of patience and perseverance makes it difficult to achieve anything.</p>

<p><strong>The Real Estate Investment Experience of Madam Chang Yao-Hung-Ying, Chairperson of Grand Pacific Construction</strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Land I bought for hundreds of thousands in the past is now worth hundreds of millions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Madam Chang Yao-Hung-Ying, chairperson of Grand Pacific Construction, pointed out: In the 1930s, a mainlander investing in land in Taiwan was often ridiculed. But it was with this small capital and perseverance that Madam Chang Yao-Hung-Ying, who left Shanghai for Taiwan in 1947, when her husband became disillusioned with his business, saw the development potential of Taiwan. She picked up their real estate business skills from Shanghai and started buying land.</p>
<p>After more than 40 years, her long-term investment in real estate finally paid off.  Her family&rsquo;s business is growing bigger and bigger, and they now own two listed companies: ASE Technology Holding and Grand Pacific Construction. ASE Technology Holding is now the second largest packaging factory in the world. As for Grand Pacific Construction, it launched the Earl&rsquo;s Court project in Xizhi in 1987, which boosted the real estate market in Xizhi and rapidly accumulated their family&rsquo;s wealth, making them one of the richest families in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Madam Chang Yao-Hung-Ying has now passed the baton to her son, Jason Chang. Jason Chang, chairman of ASE Technology Holding, seems to have inherited his mother&rsquo;s investment acumen. He&rsquo;s the kind of person who buys land wherever he goes, whether it&rsquo;s in Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China, or the United States. Perhaps in another two or three decades, Jason Chang will also say: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect that the land I bought for a few million back then would now be worth tens of billions.&rdquo;  However, Jason Chang&rsquo;s wealth accumulation speed will be much faster than his mother&rsquo;s because he has already laid a good foundation.  All he needs to do is go with the flow, and his wealth will increase geometrically, with money rolling in, unstoppable.</p>
<p><strong>Withstanding the Test of Time is the True Measure</strong></p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s not your judgment that makes you a lot of money, but your patience.</em></p>
<p>A crucial factor in financial management is time. Without a correct understanding of it, impatience will naturally arise.  Impatience leads to taking significant risks, turning potential success into failure.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the accumulation of wealth or experience, it&rsquo;s not something that can be accomplished overnight. It takes time. Fortunately, God is very fair in this regard. Regardless of whether one is born rich or poor, noble or humble, everyone has only 24 hours a day and an average lifespan of about 75 years. Time is the greatest wealth in life, and a person&rsquo;s honor, status, wealth, and happiness all depend on how they use this wealth.</p>
<p>To accumulate wealth through investment and financial management, time is an indispensable factor. It cannot be rushed.  Investment and financial management can lead to slow and steady wealth accumulation, but investing small amounts of money and wanting to earn billions of wealth in a short period is, I can say with certainty, &ldquo;impossible!&rdquo; Just imagine, can a mother give birth without going through ten months of pregnancy? Can a farmer shorten the growth period of rice seedlings?</p>
<p>The growth of wealth is like the growth of life.  It&rsquo;s formed bit by bit, day by day, month by month, year by year, under the effect of compound interest.  It cannot be achieved overnight. This is the law of nature, and God never changes his natural laws.</p>
<p><strong>Luck is Not a Long-Term Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Many investors make a fortune overnight and go bankrupt overnight. Their success is due to luck, and their failure is because &ldquo;you may be lucky for a while, but you cannot always be lucky.&rdquo; <strong>Any investment opportunity that promises overnight riches must hide a greater risk of overnight poverty.</strong> This is why most of those who fantasize about getting rich quickly through financial management end up losing everything.</p>
<p>As long as you are patient and invest your assets in the right investment vehicles, you don&rsquo;t need to actively manage or worry. Compound interest will naturally lead to wealth growth, and becoming a billionaire over time is almost a certainty. In investment and financial management, haste makes waste. &ldquo;Fast&rdquo; is definitely not good!</p>
<p>If you really want to get rich quickly, I suggest you try entrepreneurship instead of investment and financial management. If any of the readers want to get rich quickly, what should they do?  My sincere suggestion is to choose the path of entrepreneurship. I have studied the wealth accumulation process of many rich people throughout history and found that there are many examples of getting rich quickly through entrepreneurship. Bill Gates, the richest man in the United States, dropped out of college in his freshman year to found Microsoft and became the richest man in the United States in just 20 years.</p>
<p>However, the probability of success in getting rich through entrepreneurship is extremely low.  According to statistics from the Taiwan Entrepreneurship Association, the success rate of a person&rsquo;s first business venture is only about 7%, and entrepreneurial success does not necessarily mean getting rich. In other words, for every successful entrepreneur we see, there are at least dozens of unknown failures behind them.  Moreover, the entrepreneurial process is very arduous. Working more than ten hours a day seems to be a prerequisite for successful entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>On the contrary, as long as the method is correct, investing money in the stock market and property market, and waiting patiently for decades, the probability of getting rich through investment and financial management is very high. It&rsquo;s hard not to get rich, and the process is relatively easy and enjoyable!  Which method you choose to get rich is up to you. I must emphasize again that there is a possibility of getting rich quickly through entrepreneurship, but it is absolutely impossible to get rich quickly through financial management.</p>

      <description>This article explores the importance of investing and managing finances, emphasizing the principle of &amp;#39;the sooner, the better.&amp;#39; It points out that procrastination is the primary cause of financial failure and encourages young people to start managing their finances early, rather than waiting until middle or old age.  The article uses the success stories of Warren Buffett and Jeffrey Koo Jr. to illustrate the power of long-term investment and compound interest. It also emphasizes that even with limited funds, one should start managing their finances and learn how to utilize high-return investment tools to grow their wealth.</description>

<p>The mentality of &ldquo;things will work out&rdquo; and a passive approach to financial management is the most common obstacle to personal finance. It&rsquo;s also the main reason why many people struggle to achieve financial independence by retirement.  Many individuals adopt a passive attitude towards financial planning, believing that things will naturally fall into place. As they age and witness the rapid growth of others&rsquo; wealth, they finally realize the importance of financial management.  However, by then, time is often limited, the power of compound interest cannot be fully utilized, and it becomes too late, even if they understand the principles of financial management.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Management Is Not Just for the Middle-Aged</strong></p>
<p>Many young people believe that financial management is something for middle-aged or wealthy individuals, and that it&rsquo;s not too late to worry about it in old age.  Here, I want to remind readers that the ability to build wealth through financial management has little correlation with the amount of money one possesses, but a significant correlation with the length of time invested.  People often reach middle age, facing retirement with some savings, and only then start thinking about preparing for their financial future. However, at this point, it&rsquo;s often too late. The reason is insufficient time to allow compound interest to work its magic.  Turning small amounts of money into substantial wealth requires at least two to three decades.  Recall the previous example: 10 years is not enough time to see significant growth.  A much longer period is needed for remarkable results.</p>
<p>Since we know that building wealth through investment requires investing in high-return assets and leveraging the long-term effects of compound interest, our approach, besides enriching our investment knowledge and skills, should involve immediate action.  Financial planning should start as early as possible, cultivating patience and a long-term perspective.</p>
<p>The reason for many financial failures today is the lack of knowledge about how to utilize funds effectively to achieve the goal of making money work for you and building wealth through investment. This is a flaw in our education system. Schools dedicate significant time to teaching students how to earn a living but fail to teach them how to manage their earnings.  College students exploring financial management through stock investment are often viewed as engaging in speculative and greedy behavior. In a future dominated by finance, the lack of proper financial knowledge not only erodes the dream of wealth accumulation but also harms the financial operations of businesses and the overall prosperity of society.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t delay your financial plan using the excuse of uncertain future price trends.  Who can predict when real estate or stock prices will rise?  Past price surges always lead to regret for those who missed out. There are no clear signs before prices start to rise, and no one will announce it with fanfare. <strong>For investments that are unpredictable in the short term but offer high expected returns in the long term, the safest strategy is to invest first and then wait for the opportunity, not the other way around.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Warren Buffett Started Investing at Age 11</strong></p>
<p><em>I believe every business school graduate should sign a contract pledging to make no more than 20 major decisions in their lifetime. If your career spans 40 years, that&rsquo;s one decision every two years.</em></p>
<p>Warren Buffett, ranked the second richest man in America by Forbes magazine in 1996, is widely regarded as the god of stock investment. He claims that more than half of his net worth is attributed to about ten investment decisions. He believes the key to investment is to buy stocks of good companies at good prices and hold them for the long term. As long as these companies continue to perform well, don&rsquo;t sell their stocks.</p>
<p>Buffett, with a net worth of $9 billion, amassed his fortune entirely from the stock market.  At 68, he held an MBA from Columbia University and was the son of a stockbroker-turned-congressman.  Buffett made his first investment at the age of 11, putting his and his sister&rsquo;s small savings into the stock market. Initially, he lost money, and his sister criticized him, but he insisted that it would take three to four years to see profits. His sister sold her shares, while he held on, ultimately proving his point.</p>
<p>At 20, while studying at Columbia University, Buffett immersed himself in finance books and insurance industry statistics while his peers focused on leisure activities.  Lacking capital and disliking borrowing, he often sold stocks prematurely to reinvest in others. Despite the limitations of his funds, his wealth continued to grow.</p>
<p>In 1954, he joined Professor Graham&rsquo;s investment firm. Two years later, he raised $100,000 from family and friends and established his own firm. After its assets increased thirtyfold, he dissolved the company in 1969, returned the partners&rsquo; money, and focused on his own investments.</p>
<p>He is a true stock market tycoon and has been America&rsquo;s richest man for years. Other wealthy Americans, like Bill Gates and Henry Lea Hillman, built their fortunes through businesses, while Buffett focused on stock investment. As long as the US economy continues to grow, his wealth will continue to increase.</p>
<p>Buffett&rsquo;s immense wealth, accumulated through nearly 60 years of investing, is a testament to the power of compound interest.  His early experiences with trial and error played a crucial role in honing his investment acumen.</p>

<p>If time is an indispensable element of financial management, the best strategy is to act now. Start managing your finances today!</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t Wait Until Your Hair Turns White</strong></p>
<p>The earlier you start investing, the sooner you&rsquo;ll achieve your financial goals and enjoy the fruits of your labor with your family. Furthermore, starting early maximizes the time for compound interest to work, requiring smaller initial investments and making financial management easier and more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Starting later requires significantly higher monthly investments to reach the same goals. The following table is based on these assumptions: an annual return of 15%, a target amount of 100 million yuan, and a retirement age of 65. It calculates the required monthly investment for different starting ages.</p>

<p>The table clearly demonstrates that youth is a valuable asset in wealth accumulation. The younger you are, the better positioned you are to achieve the dream of building wealth from small investments.

Don&rsquo;t wait until your hair turns white; time waits for no one.</p>
<p>Your future financial well-being depends on your actions today. Don&rsquo;t let hesitation hold you back. Follow the principles outlined in this book, invest your funds in the stock market, real estate, or other high-return investment vehicles, and over time, you too can become wealthy.</p>
<p><em>1. The earlier you start investing, the longer the time for compound interest to work, and the sooner you&rsquo;ll achieve your wealth goals.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Only young people can dream of building wealth from small investments.</em></p>
<p><em>3. The best time to start managing your finances is as early as possible.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Koo Jr.&rsquo;s Path to Wealth</strong></p>
<p>Jeffrey Koo Jr., the eldest son of Jeffrey Koo Sr., chairman of Chinatrust Commercial Bank in Taiwan, and current Vice President of Chinatrust, is actively uniting the third generation of Taiwanese entrepreneurs. He organized a luncheon club primarily for the third generation of prominent Taiwanese business families to network and exchange information. To expand its influence, Koo Jr. has also strengthened the luncheon club&rsquo;s connections with Southeast Asian politicians and the second and third generations of overseas Chinese business families.</p>
<p>Koo Jr. is a representative figure among Taiwan&rsquo;s third-generation entrepreneurs and the heir apparent to his father. Many assume his wealthy background afforded him a comfortable financial situation. However, Koo Sr. instilled frugal habits in his children and didn&rsquo;t provide excessive allowances.  Koo Jr. had to find his own ways to become financially independent.</p>
<p>Sent to Japan for his education by his father, Koo Jr. returned to Taiwan for university after graduating high school with only his accumulated New Year&rsquo;s money, around NT$100,000, in his bank account. In early 1987, as the weighted stock price index climbed from 1,000 points, many people invested in the stock market. Koo Jr., then a junior in college, followed suit, investing all his savings.  His grandmother&rsquo;s daily routine of asking him to recite the stock market index further influenced him.  His frequent interactions with entrepreneurs from various industries provided him with business opportunities, enabling him to grow his NT$100,000 capital to NT$10 million during the bull market.</p>
<p>When the stock market crashed from over 10,000 points in 1990, he was already pursuing his Master&rsquo;s degree at the Wharton School of Business in the US. His father, hoping for him to join the family business sooner, disapproved of his overseas studies and threatened to withhold financial support. Koo Jr. confidently assured his father that he could support himself financially. He successfully completed his studies in the US and even bought his dream car, a Porsche, with his own money.  Koo Jr.&rsquo;s knack for investment and financial management from a young age made his dreams a reality. If you aspire to be wealthy, start now!</p>
<p><strong>Youth Is the Greatest Asset for Financial Success</strong></p>
<p>Successful people have a habit: they delay, but don&rsquo;t give up, the enjoyment of the fruits of their labor.</p>
<p>In Louis Cha&rsquo;s novel <em>The Book and the Sword</em>, the Qianlong Emperor tells his sworn brother, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t envy anything about you except your youth.&rdquo; Even the emperor envied youth.</p>
<p>Similarly, from a financial perspective, youth is the most important asset. I often tell college students, &ldquo;Young people, your name is wealth!&rdquo;  The compound interest formula clearly shows that time is money, and youth is wealth.</p>
<p>The compound interest chart provides a clear roadmap for financial planning: focus on increasing income and saving during your youth and start investing early. Money saved during youth contributes significantly to wealth in old age.  NT$10,000 saved in your youth can grow to over NT$2.3 million in 30 years.  The same amount saved in old age will only grow to NT$60,000 in 10 years. Whether the statement &ldquo;Young people, your name is wealth&rdquo; becomes a reality depends on whether young people manage their finances wisely. Poor financial management, even with the advantage of youth, will not bring wealth.</p>
<p>The prevalent notion among young people today is that it&rsquo;s fine to indulge in enjoyment while young and worry about financial planning later. This is a misguided perspective. Many young people believe retirement is far off and their funds are limited, so there&rsquo;s no need to consider investment. They often miss the opportunity to start early.</p>
<p>In reality, starting financial planning in old age, even with some savings, is often too late due to limited time. The correct approach is: <strong>investing and managing finances is the job of young people, while managing wealth is the job of old age.</strong>  However, many young people prioritize immediate gratification, spending their money on sports cars, high-end audio systems, or travel, believing they can enjoy life now and worry about finances later.</p>
<p>If you understand the role of time in financial management, it&rsquo;s easy to see why such individuals are destined for mediocrity.  Countless examples in society demonstrate how prioritizing enjoyment in youth leads to poverty in old age. The key is their neglect of the importance of early financial planning. By the time they realize it, it&rsquo;s often too late.</p>
<p>As Taiwan&rsquo;s population ages and smaller family structures become the norm, future generations will rely on their own financial resources for living expenses. Therefore, the concept of starting financial planning in youth becomes increasingly critical.</p>
<p><strong>Youth Is the Best Time for Taking Risks</strong></p>
<p>Young people possess the most valuable asset in financial management - time. Youth is also the best time to take risks because family responsibilities are generally lighter. Young people should embrace a risk-taking mindset because the cost of failure is lower.  You can recover from setbacks more easily. Moreover, with limited funds, potential losses are smaller, providing valuable learning experiences.  Most importantly, young people have ample time for compound interest to work its magic.</p>
<p>Before 50, one shouldn&rsquo;t adopt an overly conservative approach to investment and financial management. The best time to learn about financial management is as early as possible. Sound financial judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from mistakes. Since developing good judgment requires making some mistakes along the way, why not gain this experience while you&rsquo;re young and the stakes are lower?  By the time you have more capital, you can apply your honed financial judgment effectively.</p>
<p>Young people should not just spend money but also understand the importance of saving. Start saving, and once you have a few thousand or tens of thousands of yuan, consider long-term, high-return investments, even if they carry some risk.</p>
<p>Some may feel they are no longer young and their current income is low, leaving no surplus for investment. Indeed, older individuals have less time to benefit from compound interest. However, don&rsquo;t be discouraged. Money can buy time, and you might still have opportunities to catch up.  By following sound financial principles, you can achieve unexpected gains. If you are past 50, help your children by sharing these fundamental wealth-building concepts so they don&rsquo;t miss out on the opportunity to build wealth early in their lives.  Instead of giving your next generation money, teach them the knowledge of making money work for them.</p>
<p><em>1. Youth is the greatest asset for building wealth through financial management. 2. Young people should embrace risk-taking because the cost of failure is lower.</em> <em>3. Invest when you&rsquo;re young to maximize the benefits of compound interest over time.</em></p>

</h3>
<p>Some believe that financial management is exclusive to the wealthy and high-income families, requiring substantial capital to even consider it.  Indeed, financial management is about making money work for you. It&rsquo;s not about turning stone into gold or creating something from nothing, so you need some initial capital. However, what many don&rsquo;t realize is that the most influential factors on future wealth, according to the compound interest formula, are the rate of return and the length of the investment period, not the current amount of capital or future contributions.</p>
<p><strong>Small Beginnings Can Lead to Great Fortunes</strong></p>
<p>With the right approach, even a small amount of money can generate significant wealth over time, as illustrated in previous examples.  Even someone with no initial capital, by investing 14,000 yuan annually, can become a millionaire in 40 years.  <strong>The principle of investment and financial management is this: understanding how to utilize high-return tools and the long-term effects of compound interest is more important than the amount of money invested.</strong></p>
<p>A common misconception is that financial planning is only necessary after accumulating a large sum of money. In reality, the key factors influencing future wealth are the rate of return and the length of investment period, not the amount of capital.  The key to successful financial management lies in maximizing returns and holding investments for the long term.  While having more capital can accelerate wealth accumulation, it&rsquo;s not the decisive factor.</p>
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;ve considered investing but dismissed the idea due to limited funds. By doing so, you&rsquo;ve missed a valuable opportunity to enhance your investment skills.  The focus of investment should not be on &ldquo;how much money is earned&rdquo; but on &ldquo;the rate of return&rdquo; at which money is earned.  For example, earning 5,000 yuan on a principal of 100,000 yuan represents a 5% return, which is a poor investment. Earning 2,000 yuan on a principal of 10,000 yuan represents a 20% return, which is a good investment.  Over time, the latter will significantly outperform the former.  Therefore, the earlier you learn financial management, the better. It allows limited funds to leverage the power of compound interest and create substantial wealth.</p>
<p><strong>Those with Less Should Strive Harder</strong></p>
<p>Some may question how to invest with only a few thousand or tens of thousands of yuan. In today&rsquo;s developed financial markets, investment units are highly divisible. Around 10,000 yuan can buy a lower-priced stock, and a few thousand yuan can be invested in mutual funds.  Real estate is also moving towards securitization. In short, there will be more investment options for smaller amounts in the future.  Therefore, any idle funds not needed in the short term, even a few thousand yuan, should be invested.</p>
<p>Are people truly too poor to manage small amounts of money?  During the Chang Hwa Credit Cooperative bank run, many ordinary people withdrew hundreds of thousands of yuan.  Statistics also show that the average bank deposit is 600,000 yuan, which is more than enough for investment purposes.</p>
<p>Even those with no current savings or expecting limited future income shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate themselves and give up on financial planning. While wealthy or high-income individuals have a head start, those with fewer assets or lower incomes should understand the principles of financial management and leverage it to compensate for their financial disadvantages, ultimately improving their lifetime financial situation.</p>
<p>Moreover, individuals from humble beginnings and with modest incomes can achieve a greater sense of accomplishment by building wealth through diligent financial management.  As the saying goes, &ldquo;<strong>There&rsquo;s nothing remarkable about playing a good hand well; it&rsquo;s playing a bad hand well that deserves admiration.</strong>&rdquo; If you truly have no money, find ways to increase income and reduce expenses, save some money, and then start managing your finances. Remember, even a small amount of money is enough to begin. While the path to wealth may be longer and more challenging with limited initial funds, the goal is still achievable, and the journey itself is valuable.</p>
<p><em>1. Investment and financial management are not exclusive to the wealthy or high-income earners.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Those with limited assets or low incomes should leverage financial management to catch up.</em></p>
<p><em>3. The amount of money you have when you start doesn&rsquo;t matter. Less money might even be better, allowing you to experiment with smaller investments initially and gradually increase your investment as you become more comfortable with risk.</em></p>
<p><em>4. Leverage other people&rsquo;s money to accelerate wealth building.</em></p>

      <description>This article criticizes the traditional financial concept of “saving money in the bank”.  It points out that under inflation, low bank deposit interest rates struggle to withstand erosion from inflation, effectively resulting in “the more you save, the less you have”. This viewpoint is supported by examples from biblical stories, savings rate data, and the Nobel Prize Foundation&amp;#39;s case, encouraging readers to invest their funds in long-term, high-return investment tools like stocks and real estate to achieve wealth appreciation.</description>

<p>There&rsquo;s a parable in the Bible about financial stewardship. A landowner entrusted his property to three servants. He gave the first servant five units of money, the second two, and the third one. He told them to cherish and manage their wealth wisely, and he would return in a year to see how they had fared.</p>
<p><strong>Wasting Time and Money</strong></p>
<p>The first servant invested his money; the second bought raw materials and produced goods to sell; the third, for safety, buried his money under a tree. A year later, the landowner returned.  The first two servants had doubled their wealth, pleasing the landowner.  Only the third servant&rsquo;s money remained unchanged. He explained, &ldquo;Fearing loss through mismanagement, I kept the money safe. Today, I return it untouched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landowner was furious.  &ldquo;You lazy servant!&rdquo; he scolded. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t even try to utilize your wealth!&rdquo;  Wealth not utilized is wasted money and wasted potential. The third servant was rebuked not for misusing the money, nor for losing it through failed investments, but for keeping it &ldquo;safe&rdquo; and unproductive.</p>
<p>Keeping money in the bank is the most common approach to personal finance today, and also the biggest mistake people make.  Therefore, the first and most important financial rule this book offers is: <em>Don&rsquo;t keep your money in the bank.</em>  &ldquo;Bank&rdquo; here refers to post offices, commercial banks, and any other financial institution where money can be deposited.</p>
<p>Many believe that earning interest in a bank, benefiting from compound interest, constitutes sound financial planning. In reality, with inflation, the real rate of return is close to zero, meaning no real financial gain. Therefore, leaving money in the bank is equivalent to no financial management at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to predict how much wealth each person will accumulate through financial management. The only certainty is that getting rich solely through bank savings is incredibly difficult.  Ask yourself, &ldquo;Have you ever heard of anyone getting rich purely from bank deposits?&rdquo;  Those who keep all their savings in the bank often find themselves not only failing to become wealthy in their old age but also struggling to maintain financial independence. Such stories are common.  Those who choose bank deposits as their primary financial management method do so primarily for safety. However, readers must understand:  <strong>&ldquo;Money in the bank is safest in the short term, but the most dangerous form of financial management in the long term.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Blind Spots in Personal Finance</strong></p>
<p><em>Most people manage their finances by keeping their money in the bank, so most people are not wealthy.</em></p>
<p>If accumulating immense wealth were as easy as the examples suggest, then most people over 65 today would be millionaires. However, this is far from reality.  Millionaires over 65 are few and far between, with many senior citizens facing financial hardship, relying on continued work or support from their children to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Surveys on the elderly in Taiwan reveal increasingly serious financial challenges for senior citizens.  Among approximately 1.48 million people aged 65 and above, about 13% rely on financial assistance from family and friends or social welfare.  This demonstrates a serious problem with most people&rsquo;s financial concepts and investment methods. How else could they reach old age not only without wealth but without even basic financial independence?</p>
<p>Taiwan&rsquo;s savings rate has historically been above 30%, currently hovering between 20% and 30%, consistently ranking among the highest globally. This indicates excellent performance in saving and budgeting. Consequently, we can deduce that flawed financial management is the primary reason for the lack of financial independence among ordinary people. To understand where they go wrong, we must first observe how they handle their assets. In various lectures, I often ask the audience, &ldquo;How are your assets stored?&rdquo;  The majority answer: &ldquo;In the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Prioritizing Security over Investment</strong></p>
<p>Surveys on Taiwanese household investment preferences reveal that the top three investment choices are demand deposits (72%), rotating savings and credit associations (53%), and time deposits (36%). Clearly, most people lean towards traditional financial methods.  Furthermore, when asked, &ldquo;If you had 10 million Taiwan dollars in savings, how would you use it?&rdquo;, about 41% of surveyed households said they would deposit it in a financial institution to earn interest. This illustrates the widespread preference for bank savings.</p>
<p>Indeed, people have high savings rates and a strong preference for depositing money in financial institutions to earn interest.  In early 1996, total deposits in Taiwanese financial institutions reached 12.6 trillion Taiwan dollars.  With a population of 21 million, this translates to an average deposit of 600,000 Taiwan dollars per person, regardless of age.  For an average family of four, this amounts to 2.4 million Taiwan dollars.  This demonstrates a strong inclination towards bank savings. However, this traditional and conservative approach is the primary reason why most people fail to achieve wealth through investment.</p>
<p>This phenomenon reveals an over-reliance on traditional bank deposits for financial management. People prioritize safety and convenience over the rate of return. However, focusing solely on earning and saving money, then depositing it in a bank, is often the first step towards financial mismanagement.</p>

<p>Keeping money in the bank is like having no financial plan at all.</p></blockquote>

</h3>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with bank deposits? The problem lies in the low interest rates (return on investment), making them unsuitable for long-term investment tools.</p>
<p>How much interest can bank deposits earn?  The salaries of average office workers are usually directly deposited into demand deposit accounts (current interest rates around 2%-4%). A portion serves as temporary funds or covers daily expenses, while the remainder is transferred to time deposits (current interest rates around 5%-8%) for investment purposes. Thus, the average interest rate earned on bank deposits is about 5%.</p>
<p><strong>5% Interest is Hardly a Path to Wealth</strong></p>
<p>Most people have a basic understanding of compound interest, believing that interest earned on bank deposits, accumulating over time, can create substantial wealth. This misconception arises from a superficial understanding of compounding.  The vast differences in final returns resulting from different rates of return on the same principal over the same period often come as a surprise.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s illustrate with an example. Suppose someone saves 14,000 Taiwan dollars annually at the end of each year for 40 years, depositing everything into a bank account with an average interest rate of 5%. How much will they accumulate after 40 years? Before answering, recall the similar example from the previous section, but with the money in a bank instead of invested in stocks or real estate with an average annual return of 20%.</p>
<p>You might guess 25 million, 10 million, or even a conservative 5 million Taiwan dollars.  The correct answer, however, is only 1.69 million.  This can be calculated using the future value of an annuity formula:</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mtable displaystyle="true" columnalign="right center left" columnspacing="0 thickmathspace" rowspacing="3pt"><mtr><mtd><mn>14,000</mn><mo>×</mo><mfrac><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0.05</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>40</mn></mrow></msup><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mn>0.05</mn></mfrac></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>1,690,000</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mn>14,000</mn><mo>×</mo><mfrac><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0.20</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>40</mn></mrow></msup><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mn>0.20</mn></mfrac></mtd><mtd><mi></mi><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>102,810,000</mn></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare this with the 20% return scenario.  The only difference between the two formulas is the rate of return (5% vs. 20%). A 20% return over 40 years yields 102.81 million Taiwan dollars, while a 5% return over the same period yields only 1.69 million, less than a fraction of the former. The difference is over 60 times! This illustrates the power of compound interest.  Many assume they benefit from compound interest in a bank, but at a 5% return, even with compounding over a long period, the wealth creation effect is very limited.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates that one of the keys to successful financial management is the rate of return. The key is not just whether your assets are invested, but <em>where</em> they are invested and what the rate of return is.</p>

<p>Forty years ago, a millionaire was truly wealthy.  Today, a millionaire might struggle to afford a house. Why?  Inflation.  Every investor must consider the impact of inflation.</p>
<p><em>Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money and lowers the real rate of return, diminishing the effect of wealth accumulation.</em></p>
<p>Over the past 30 years, the average annual inflation rate in Taiwan has been around 5%. What about the future?  Inflation and economic growth are closely linked. As Taiwan&rsquo;s economy continues to grow, inflation is expected to remain around 5% annually.</p>
<p>Inflation means continuously rising prices, which translates to decreasing purchasing power.  If you keep your money in a demand deposit account earning 4% interest with a 5% inflation rate, what happens?  Your purchasing power decreases.  The longer your money sits in a savings account, the less it&rsquo;s worth.  What used to cost 10 Taiwan dollars for a newspaper now costs 15. Your 10 dollars can now only buy two-thirds of a newspaper. With inflation, money in the bank shrinks like wool submerged in water.</p>
<p><strong>Saving Alone Won&rsquo;t Make You Rich, Not Even in Two Lifetimes</strong></p>
<p>With 5% inflation and a nominal interest rate of around 5% on bank deposits, your real rate of return is zero. In this scenario, the effect of compound interest is nullified.  Wealth accumulation relies solely on painstaking saving. Imagine someone saves 500,000 Taiwan dollars a year. How long would it take to become a billionaire?  200 years!</p>
<p>Saving 500,000 Taiwan dollars a year is difficult; living for 200 years is even harder!  Therefore, even with diligent saving and budgeting, if all the money is kept in the bank, this person won&rsquo;t become wealthy in this lifetime, and worse, not even in the next! The average lifespan is around 75 years, meaning two lifetimes total only 150 years.  It would take a third lifetime for someone relying solely on bank savings to potentially reach billionaire status.  If a family maintains the financial strategy of &ldquo;frugality and bank savings,&rdquo; it would take at least 200 years, or about seven generations, for them to potentially become wealthy.  Conversely, with proper financial management, wealth can be achieved in 40 years (half a lifetime).</p>
<p><strong>Money in the Bank Should Be Spent Sooner Rather Than Later</strong></p>
<p>I remember 30 years ago, when I was in second or third grade, a popsicle cost 20 cents, and a red bean ice cream cost 50 cents.  My parents gave me 50 cents each day for allowance, which I invariably spent on red bean ice cream after school. My parents constantly encouraged me to save, so my father opened a bank account for me. If I had been obedient and developed good saving habits from a young age, saving those 50 cents daily and earning 8% interest, it would have grown tenfold over 30 years, to 5 Taiwan dollars.  However, a red bean ice cream now costs 15 Taiwan dollars. Those 5 dollars can only buy one-third of a red bean ice cream. More importantly, for a小学生 30 years ago, a red bean ice cream was precious.  Even a dozen red bean ice creams today couldn&rsquo;t compare to the value of one back then. Had I followed my parents&rsquo; financial advice and kept my money in the bank, I would regret it now.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you&rsquo;re going to keep money in the bank, my sincere advice is: &ldquo;Spend it sooner rather than later!&rdquo; This might sound shocking, but there&rsquo;s logic to it.  From an economic perspective, money has more value and higher utility when used sooner. We save money in the bank, delaying gratification for the sake of greater enjoyment in the future.  However, with inflation, money left in the bank often leads to <em>less</em> enjoyment.</p>
<p><strong>The Value of Money Decreases with Age</strong></p>
<p>My wife and her friends developed a financial philosophy: &ldquo;Money is most valuable when spent while young.&rdquo; This makes economic sense.  Their reasoning: &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re old, delicacies might harm your health, traveling becomes difficult, and most importantly, wearing beautiful clothes attracts unwanted attention and ridicule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, everyone managing their finances must be mindful of the dual pressures of inflation and the diminishing value of money with age. Bank deposit interest rates cannot compensate for these losses. In other words, <strong>money in the bank, while nominally increasing, actually decreases in value.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m not encouraging you to spend all your savings immediately.  Rather, I&rsquo;m highlighting that if you keep money in the bank, you must consider the declining purchasing power due to inflation and the reduced economic benefit as you age.  The fundamental solution is to withdraw your money from the bank and invest it in instruments with higher returns than bank deposit rates. <strong>Therefore, the best way to combat inflation is: Don&rsquo;t keep your money in the bank. Invest in long-term, high-return assets like stocks and real estate.</strong></p>
<p>Because inflation decreases real returns and hinders wealth accumulation, even saving 14,000 Taiwan dollars annually and investing in stocks or real estate for 40 years to become a billionaire won&rsquo;t carry the same weight as being a billionaire today.  Therefore, under inflation, consider using the <em>real</em> rate of return. If the return on investment is 20% and inflation is 5%, the real return is 15%.  So how much should you save annually, investing in stocks or real estate with a nominal return of around 20% (real return of 15%), to become a billionaire in 40 years?  The answer is 57,000 Taiwan dollars per year.</p>

<p>Chang Po-hsin, the current standing director of Chang Hwa Bank, with assets exceeding tens of billions, inherited and expanded upon the fortune of his father, Chang Pin-san, the former chairman of Chang Hwa Bank, earning him a place among Taiwan&rsquo;s wealthiest individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Trading Bank Deposits for Stock Dividends</strong></p>
<p>Forty years ago, both Chang Pin-san and my father were from Nantun District, Taichung City.  They were not only fellow townsmen but also colleagues. Back then, Chang Pin-san was just a junior manager at Chang Hwa Bank, without much wealth.  However, he borrowed money to buy Chang Hwa Bank shares from colleagues who wanted to sell them. At the time, stock dividends were far lower than bank interest. Despite this, Chang Pin-san persisted in borrowing money to acquire shares, holding onto them for the long term.  Other colleagues deposited the proceeds from their stock sales into banks. Years later, Chang Pin-san, owning the most shares, became the largest shareholder and eventually the chairman of Chang Hwa Bank, laying the foundation for his immense wealth.</p>
<p>Chang Pin-san was also friends with Lien Chen-tung, father of Lien Chan, and encouraged him to buy Chang Hwa Bank shares. The Lien family&rsquo;s fortune also originated from those hundreds of Chang Hwa Bank shares.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe that the path to wealth could be so simple: borrow money to buy a few Chang Hwa Bank shares, invest in some real estate, hold them long-term, and essentially forget about them.  Decades later, great wealth is attained. Those who sold their shares and deposited the money in banks are still wondering how others became rich. Some might attribute this to luck, but financial management is not about luck.  It&rsquo;s about the method chosen and the investment tools selected.  Therefore, if you don&rsquo;t want to be poor, don&rsquo;t keep your money in the bank.</p>
<p><strong>Bank Savings Shouldn&rsquo;t Exceed Living Expenses</strong></p>
<p>Someone once jokingly asked me, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling us not to keep money in the bank.  Are we supposed to pay with stocks or real estate certificates at the supermarket or restaurant?&rdquo; Of course not!  Advising against keeping money in the bank doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t have any money in the bank at all. Bank deposits offer advantages: security and convenience. They are ideal for storing funds needed for daily expenses. However, you can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too.  Convenience comes at the cost of high returns.</p>
<p>The wise approach is to clearly divide funds into two categories: daily expenses and investments.  Keep enough for daily needs in the bank, enjoying the security and convenience it offers. Invest the rest in higher-return assets like stocks and real estate.</p>
<p>In my opinion, keeping the equivalent of two months&rsquo; living expenses in the bank is sufficient for an individual or family. Most individuals and families receive regular income, which is deposited into their bank accounts. Therefore, one month&rsquo;s expenses for immediate use and another month&rsquo;s worth as a safety net should be ample.  The remaining funds should be invested in higher-return assets like stocks and real estate.  In other words, if your monthly expenses average 50,000 Taiwan dollars, and your bank balance consistently exceeds 100,000, you are not managing your finances effectively.  Actively seek suitable investment opportunities to make your surplus funds work for you.</p>
<p><strong>The &ldquo;Two Big, One Small&rdquo; Approach to Flexible Fund Management</strong></p>
<p>Some believe in maintaining substantial emergency funds. However, even if unforeseen circumstances drain your bank savings, there&rsquo;s no need to panic. The high-return investments mentioned earlier—stocks and real estate—are not as illiquid as some might think.  Listed stocks in Taiwan&rsquo;s active stock market can be sold almost any day of the year (excluding holidays), providing quick access to cash within a few days.  Reluctant to sell? Stocks can also be used as collateral for loans.</p>
<p>Real estate is less liquid than stocks, but many Taiwanese banks now offer &ldquo;revolving mortgage loans,&rdquo; allowing property owners to convert fixed assets into liquid assets. These loans involve mortgaging a property to secure a credit line of up to 70%-75% of the property&rsquo;s value. Borrowers can draw and repay funds as needed, with interest accruing only on the outstanding balance. For example, a 10 million Taiwan dollar property could secure a 7.5 million credit line.  Borrowing 5 million leaves 2.5 million available without interest charges, with interest accruing only on the 5 million borrowed.  Any surplus funds can be used to repay the loan, reducing interest costs.</p>
<p>Many financial experts recommend a &ldquo;three-part&rdquo; approach, dividing assets equally among bank savings, real estate, and more speculative investments. I propose a &ldquo;two big, one small&rdquo; approach: allocate most of your assets to stocks and real estate, keeping a small portion in a bank for daily expenses.  This isn&rsquo;t my invention. In fact, this is the portfolio strategy employed by many who have achieved wealth through investments.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Keeping money in the bank is the riskiest form of financial management.  Inflation erodes returns, leaving real interest rates near zero.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Banks offer convenience, not high returns.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>Keep only two months&rsquo; worth of living expenses in the bank.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>Trying to get rich with money in the bank is like trying to win a baseball game without swinging the bat.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If all this hasn&rsquo;t convinced you to reconsider keeping most of your money in a financial institution, perhaps the story of the Nobel Prize Foundation&rsquo;s success might change your mind.</p>

<p>Every October, the Nobel Committee announces the Nobel laureates. The Nobel Prize attracts global attention not only for representing the highest academic honor but also because each laureate receives a substantial prize of 1 million US dollars.</p>
<p><strong>The Folly of Depleting Capital</strong></p>
<p>The Nobel Foundation awards several prizes annually, disbursing millions of dollars. This raises the question: How large is the Nobel fund to sustain such substantial payouts? The Nobel Foundation&rsquo;s success, besides the substantial initial donation by Alfred Nobel over a century ago, is largely attributed to its shrewd financial management.</p>
<p>Established in 1896 with a 9.8 million US dollar donation from Nobel, the foundation&rsquo;s purpose is to fund the prizes.  Flawless fund management was paramount.  Initially, its charter stipulated that investments be restricted to safe, fixed-income instruments like bank deposits and government bonds, explicitly excluding stocks and real estate to avoid market risks.</p>
<p>This capital preservation approach, prioritizing safety over returns, seemed prudent, preventing losses. However, sacrificing returns had consequences.  After 50 years of prize payouts and operating expenses, low returns depleted two-thirds of the Nobel fund, leaving only a little over 3 million US dollars by 1953.</p>
<p><strong>From 3 Million to 270 Million: The Secret</strong></p>
<p>Facing depletion, the Nobel Foundation&rsquo;s board recognized the importance of investment returns. In 1953, they made a groundbreaking change, amending the charter to shift from bank deposits and bonds to primarily stocks and real estate.  This shift in investment philosophy transformed the foundation&rsquo;s fate. Over the next 40 years, despite continued prize payouts and operating costs, the foundation not only recovered all previous losses but also grew its assets to 270 million US dollars by 1993.</p>

<p>Had the Nobel Foundation not changed its approach 40 years ago, clinging to bank savings, it would have vanished, unable to fund the prizes.  Perhaps other wealthy individuals would have established new foundations with larger prizes, replacing the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>The Nobel Foundation&rsquo;s history underscores the importance of financial management.  Even a substantial initial fund, if mismanaged, can be depleted. Conversely, even with significant spending, skillful management can generate rapid growth.</p>
<p>I once heard of a Taiwanese hometown association that established a foundation with 100,000 Taiwan dollars 40 years ago to provide scholarships for children from their hometown.  Forty years later, the fund remains at 100,000 Taiwan dollars. While a significant sum back then, today it barely covers administrative costs, threatening the foundation&rsquo;s existence.  The problem? Neglecting financial management.</p>
<p>Learning from the Nobel Foundation, many US foundations, pension funds, university endowments, and even personal trusts have shifted from bank deposits and bonds to primarily stocks and real estate. In contrast, few Taiwanese foundations grasp this concept, and university endowments rarely address financial management seriously.  The fate of these foundations, if they don&rsquo;t adapt, is clear.</p>
<p>I often participate in corporate training programs, where I habitually ask companies about the size and investment strategy of their employee welfare funds.  The answers are usually similar: small funds, mostly in bank deposits, rarely exceeding a few hundred thousand or a million Taiwan dollars. However, in 1990, during my time at China Development Corporation, the employee welfare fund exceeded 200 million Taiwan dollars. Why?  Because it was primarily invested in China Development Corporation&rsquo;s own stock.</p>

<li>The Nobel Foundation&rsquo;s course correction 40 years ago secured its status today.</li>

</ol>

</ul>
<p>Will your hard-earned wealth shrink like the early Nobel fund, or grow like the later one? The key lies in <em>how</em> you invest. If, like many, you keep most of your money in the bank, it&rsquo;s not too late to change. The Nobel Foundation&rsquo;s story shows how a change in investment philosophy can transform everything.  Should you reconsider your financial habits and prioritize investments in stocks and real estate? Let the Nobel Foundation inspire your financial thinking. A single change in mindset can lead to immense wealth decades from now!</p>
