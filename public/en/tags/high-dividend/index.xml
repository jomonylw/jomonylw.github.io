      <description>In this episode, Teacher James proposes a more achievable retirement plan, suggesting that assets equal to 15 times annual expenses are sufficient for retirement. He explains in detail how to use high-dividend products (such as QQQI) and traditional index portfolios to achieve this goal, and updates the asset allocation simulation tool, sharing simulation results for investors in Taiwan and the US. Additionally, the content covers cash management and ETF selection options for non-US tax residents in mainland China, Hong Kong, and elsewhere. The Q&amp;amp;A session delves into hot topics such as financial education for children, stock pledging strategies, and local investment practices.</description>

<p>The core theme of this episode is <strong>&ldquo;Redefining the Retirement Threshold.&rdquo;</strong> Teacher James overturns the traditional notion that one needs assets equal to 50 times their annual expenses to retire. Instead, he proposes a more positive and feasible plan: <strong>Retirement is possible with assets equal to just 15 times your annual expenses.</strong> The core of this plan lies in cleverly combining the stable cash flow provided by high-dividend ETFs with the appreciation potential of growth-oriented index investing. This significantly lowers the financial threshold for retirement, opening up the possibility of early retirement for more people. At the same time, the course updates the practical asset allocation simulation tool and provides specific investment tool recommendations for investors in different regions.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Strategy</strong>: Divide assets equivalent to 15 times annual expenses into two parts:
<ol>
<li><strong>10x Annual Expenses</strong>: Invest in high-dividend products to generate an annualized dividend of approximately 12% as stable cash flow to cover living expenses.</li>
<li><strong>5x Annual Expenses</strong>: Invest in a growth-oriented investment portfolio (such as the 433 allocation) to allow assets to continue growing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>High-Dividend Tool Recommendations</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>USA</strong>: QQQI, with an annualized dividend yield of about 12%.</li>
<li><strong>Taiwan</strong>: Can purchase QQQI via sub-brokerage (复委托).</li>
<li><strong>China</strong>: CSOP Huatai-PineBridge CSI Dividend Low Volatility ETF (008163).</li>
<li><strong>Hong Kong</strong>: Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (3416.HK), currently with a dividend yield as high as 16%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advantages</strong>: This plan makes retirement goals feel less distant, as investors don&rsquo;t need to wait until they accumulate 30 or 50 times their annual expenses. Fund managers handle the professional operations (such as selling stocks or utilizing options to generate income), providing investors with stable cash flow and shielding them from the direct psychological impact of market volatility.</li>

<li><strong>Non-US Tax Residents (e.g., European, Singaporean Investors)</strong>:

<ul>
<li><strong>Tool Update</strong>: Teacher James and Martin updated the asset allocation simulator, fixed bugs, and released a 3-hour YouTube tutorial video explaining in detail how to use the tool.</li>
<li><strong>Simulation Conclusions (Based on 167% Maintenance Requirement)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Taiwan Investors (433 Allocation, Pledging Rate 3%)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Can withdraw a maximum of <strong>2.5%</strong> for living expenses annually without margin calls (liquidation).</li>
<li><strong>Special Reminder</strong>: Must consider the ~15% exchange rate fluctuation between TWD and USD. This affects the maintenance rate by about 10%, so using a 167% maintenance requirement is safer than 140%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>US Investors (Pledging LTV ~80%)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Can withdraw a maximum of <strong>2.1%</strong> for living expenses annually.</li>
<li><strong>Safety Recommendation</strong>: To leave a margin of safety (moat), it is suggested that Taiwan investors withdraw around 2.2%, and US investors withdraw 1.8%-1.9%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Non-Pledgers (80/20 Allocation)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Can withdraw <strong>2.7%</strong> annually, but the total asset value will barely grow, meaning they cannot enjoy the compounding effect of asset appreciation.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Q1</strong>: My family is well-off. How can I provide correct financial education to my young children to prevent them from developing bad spending habits?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Distinguish Consumption Types</strong>: Teach children from a young age to distinguish between &ldquo;spiritual consumption&rdquo; (e.g., travel, experiences) and &ldquo;material consumption&rdquo; (e.g., toys, brand names). Encourage the former, moderate the latter.</li>
<li><strong>Define Ownership</strong>: Clearly tell children that the money belongs to the parents, not them. Parents have the right to decide whether to meet their material demands. Do not let them take things for granted.</li>
<li><strong>Example is Better than Precept</strong>: Parents&rsquo; own spending habits are the best role model. If parents are thrifty and do not pursue material comparison (e.g., a car is fine as long as it drives; no need to chase the latest model), children will naturally be influenced.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q2</strong>: For Taiwan investors, QQQI tax refunds are delayed. Are there other local similar high-dividend funds as alternatives?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: I haven&rsquo;t specifically researched local funds in Taiwan. If you want to compare, you need to look at a few key indicators: 1. <strong>Max Drawdown</strong>, especially performance during the 2022 bear market; 2. <strong>Total Return</strong>, which is the sum of capital gains plus dividends. Compare these with QQQI to see which suits your needs better.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Share 1</strong>: His middle school child spends all pocket money on game points, refuses to save, and even half-jokingly called his father &ldquo;shabby&rdquo; (stingy).
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Do Not Reward Grades with Money</strong>: Studying is the child&rsquo;s own responsibility. Using money as an incentive may distort their values.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Improper Speech Immediately</strong>: When a child says disrespectful words like &ldquo;shabby,&rdquo; you must correct them immediately and seriously. Make them understand that this is the parents&rsquo; money, and they have no right to judge it like that. Some jokes are not to be made. You must set clear boundaries and rules for the child.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Share 2</strong>: Discussing recent social cases, lamenting the difficulty of raising children.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: Once children become adults, parents&rsquo; responsibility is limited; all the home can provide is a bed and a pair of chopsticks. The key is to set the rules well from a young age. If parents themselves have correct consumption concepts and are not wasteful, they can set a good example for their children.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: For non-US residents, handling inheritance procedures through US brokerages is extremely complex and expensive. I strongly suggest you open an account in Hong Kong (e.g., HSBC) and directly buy ETFs listed in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has no estate tax, and there are corresponding Nasdaq 100 indices and leveraged ETFs, which completely avoids this problem.</li>

<li><strong>Q1</strong>: As a Taiwanese working in the mainland, how to safely transfer funds back to Taiwan after exceeding the annual foreign exchange quota of $50,000 USD for RMB income?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: This is a difficult problem; I don&rsquo;t have a perfect solution. Apart from carrying cash personally, official channels are indeed limited. Operating through company accounts is also very complex and requires trusted relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q2</strong>: For RMB that cannot be brought back to Taiwan for the time being, should I buy short-term products like government bonds or invest directly in Chinese index funds (like 513100)?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: Directly investing in index funds is also a good choice. Since the funds cannot be moved out for now, it is better to let them continue to appreciate in the local market. There is always a possibility that China&rsquo;s foreign exchange controls will loosen in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q3</strong>: Should I put all assets (including the cash portion) into the pledge account to keep them &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: I do not recommend doing this. You should keep a portion of assets in a regular account to maintain flexibility. In case of brokerage policy changes (e.g., increased interest rates, account freezes), you have other assets as bargaining chips or emergency funds, so you won&rsquo;t be completely passive.</li>

In the long run, the USD is a strong currency, and the probability of depreciation is far lower than that of the RMB. For higher interest returns, bearing some exchange rate volatility is worth it.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: Don&rsquo;t worry. The brokerage will give you a 1099-R tax form, and the system will calculate it automatically when filing taxes. Even if there is a small penalty, the interest rate is very low, equivalent to borrowing money from the government for a year at a very low cost, which is completely acceptable.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Q1</strong>: Teacher suggests retirees with insufficient assets buy high-dividend products, but the total return of such products is lower than indices, and paying dividends is essentially selling assets. Why not just sell QQQ based on needs yourself?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: Mainly three points: 1. <strong>Overcoming Human Weakness</strong>: Operating it yourself makes you susceptible to market emotions, chasing highs and selling lows. Fund managers can execute strategies more rationally. 2. <strong>Providing Downside Protection</strong>: For example, in 2022, QQQ fell nearly 40%, while QQQI only fell about 30%. 3. <strong>Unique Income Source</strong>: QQQI earns extra premiums (about 4-5%) by selling covered call options, which is a stable cash flow source difficult for ordinary investors to replicate, ensuring dividends can be paid even in a bear market.</li>

<li><strong>Q</strong>: Regarding pledging, assuming annual expenses are 600k, pledging 3 million (5x) in the first year. In the second year, a total of 1.2 million is needed. Do I need to pledge another 3 million, or how does it work? Do I need to repay the principal after the 18-month loan?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James</strong>: In the second year, the total debt is 1.2 million. You need to ensure the total market value of the assets pledged inside is maintained at 6 million (5 times 1.2 million). You can check how much the 3 million pledged in the first year has appreciated (e.g., to 4 million), and then just make up the difference (pledge another 2 million). There is no need to repay the principal after the loan expires; just pay the interest and handle the &ldquo;renewal,&rdquo; provided the maintenance rate is higher than the bank&rsquo;s minimum requirement (recommended above 167%).</li>

      <description>In this session, Teacher James details the &amp;#39;Flexible Smart Rebalancing&amp;#39; strategy developed by student Peng, an enhanced version of the traditional smart rebalancing aimed at improving asset allocation security. The core of the strategy is to set a cash-year threshold, flexibly adjusting the funding source for rebalancing. Additionally, James discusses withdrawal rates corresponding to different Beta values and introduces high-dividend ETFs like JEPQ as a solution for retirees with insufficient cash flow.</description>

<p>This session delves into the &ldquo;Flexible Smart Rebalancing&rdquo; optimization strategy. Its core idea is to add a &ldquo;cash years&rdquo; criterion to the traditional smart rebalancing framework. When cash reserves fall below a preset number of years (e.g., 15 years), market downturns will no longer deplete cash. Instead, the underlying fund (e.g., QQQ) will be used to buy more of the leveraged fund to protect cash flow and enhance the portfolio&rsquo;s security. Concurrently, for retirees with higher cash flow needs, an alternative solution of allocating to high-dividend ETFs (such as JEPQ) is proposed.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strategy Background</strong>: This strategy was optimized and back-tested by student Peng, based on Teacher James&rsquo;s smart rebalancing concept, with the goal of increasing the maintenance rate (security).</li>
<li><strong>Core Mechanism</strong>: It introduces a customizable &ldquo;cash years&rdquo; variable (e.g., 15 years) as a threshold for switching strategies.
<ol>
<li><strong>When Cash Level is Below 15 Years</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>During a Market Upturn</strong>: Profits from the leveraged fund are moved into cash, with the goal of replenishing cash reserves to over 15 years as quickly as possible. Consider transferring 30%, 40%, or 50% of the profitable portion to accelerate cash accumulation.</li>
<li><strong>During a Market Downturn</strong>: <strong>Do not use cash</strong>. Instead, sell the underlying fund (e.g., QQQ) to buy the leveraged fund (e.g., TQQQ) to maintain the Beta value while protecting precious cash reserves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>When Cash Level is Above 15 Years</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The strategy reverts to traditional smart rebalancing. During a market downturn, cash can be used to buy more of the leveraged fund.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Strategy Version Evolution (1.0 vs. 2.0)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Version 1.0</strong>: The core is to reduce downside risk. During upturns, profits from the leveraged fund are converted to cash.</li>
<li><strong>Version 2.0</strong>: With sufficient cash (above the threshold), it increases upside potential. During upturns, profits from the leveraged fund can be moved into the underlying fund (QQQ) instead of cash. This slows down the decrease in Beta, allowing for the capture of more upside opportunities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Back-testing Conclusion</strong>: Data shows that under different Beta settings, the &ldquo;Flexible Rebalancing&rdquo; strategy, especially when using the appropriate version for different Beta values, generally provides a higher minimum maintenance rate than traditional smart rebalancing, meaning higher security.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationship Between Beta and Withdrawal Rate</strong>: The recommended annual withdrawal rate varies with the portfolio&rsquo;s volatility (Beta):
<ul>
<li>Beta 1.0: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.0%</li>
<li>Beta 0.9: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.2%</li>
<li>Beta 0.8: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.4%</li>
<li>Beta 0.7: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.8%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Solution for High Withdrawal Rates</strong>: When the required withdrawal rate <strong>exceeds 3%</strong>, traditional asset allocation becomes riskier. It is recommended to introduce high-dividend assets to supplement cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Introduction to High-Dividend ETFs (JEPQ &amp; JEPI)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>JEPQ</strong>: Annualized dividend yield of about 10%. Approximately 80% of its assets are in QQQ, with the other 20% generating cash flow by selling covered calls. Its Beta is about 0.78, making it less volatile than QQQ and suitable for retirees needing high cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>JEPI</strong>: Annualized dividend yield of about 8.37%. It operates based on SPY and has a lower Beta of about 0.57.</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: These ETFs are primarily suitable for investors who are <strong>already retired, have insufficient principal, and are highly dependent on stable cash flow</strong>. They are not recommended for young investors still in the asset accumulation phase, as their long-term capital appreciation potential is far lower than QQQ.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Principles</strong>: Even if you don&rsquo;t understand the complex strategy details, grasp these key principles:
<ol>
<li><strong>Cash is King</strong>: If using a stock pledge loan, maintain a cash position of at least 30%.</li>
<li><strong>15-Year Cash Goal</strong>: Strive to maintain cash reserves equivalent to at least 15 years of living expenses as an important safety buffer.</li>
<li><strong>Beta Control</strong>: Keep the overall portfolio Beta below 1.0 to navigate market fluctuations smoothly.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Assets and Inflation</strong>: Stocks are real assets, and their intrinsic value is not eroded by inflation. When currency depreciates, the price of assets (stock prices) will rise to reflect their value. Therefore, do not sell quality assets (like QQQ) due to fears of inflation or short-term market volatility. Selling at any time is a mistake.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing:
<ol>
<li><strong>Inspiration for Flexible Rebalancing 1.0</strong>: It originated from Teacher James&rsquo;s mention that when cash is less than 15 years, one should not use cash to buy leveraged funds during a down year. Based on this, he conducted quantitative back-testing and tested different cash-year thresholds (13, 14, 15, 16 years) and the effect of transferring different percentages (30%, 40%, 50%) of profits to cash during upturns.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration for Flexible Rebalancing 2.0</strong>: Inspired by a strategy shared by student Lin. He pondered whether, when the cash position is sufficient, profits from the leveraged fund could be moved to the underlying fund (instead of cash) to slow the decline in Beta, thereby capturing more future upside potential.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Version 1.0 aims to &ldquo;reduce downside risk,&rdquo; while Version 2.0 builds on this to &ldquo;increase upside potential.&rdquo; He emphasized that the current back-testing period is limited and this is still his personal exploration, not to be taken as a final conclusion. However, the general direction is that a higher cash position leads to a higher maintenance rate.</li>

<li>Question: Why do you recommend withdrawing 2% annually instead of borrowing the full 20% of the pledge limit from the start?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a critical risk control issue. If you borrow 20% at once and the market experiences a major crash like in 2000 (an 85% drop), your assets would fall from $1 million to $150,000, but your debt would still be $200,000. you would go bankrupt immediately. By withdrawing 2% annually, even if the market declines for three or four consecutive years, you would have only used 8% of your total assets, and your assets would still be far greater than your liabilities, allowing you to survive the crisis safely.</li>

<li>Sharing: Two things are especially important in investing: first, clarifying your investment Purpose, and second, setting a matching Target. The most dangerous situation is a mismatch between purpose and target. For example, investing with a mindset of entertainment (gambling) but expecting a stable cash flow or high returns will inevitably lead to disaster. Many friends around her made this mistake by engaging in all sorts of frantic trading during a bull market.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Very well said. It&rsquo;s like someone who does drugs and stays up all night but expects to be healthy—an impossible task. The actions of most people are contrary to their ultimate goals, but they don&rsquo;t realize it themselves. This is a lifelong tragedy.</li>

<li>Question: After I retire, my annual Social Security and pension income will be about $100,000. In this case, is it sufficient for me to set aside a 10-year cash reserve?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your situation is excellent. Since your basic living expenses are covered by this $100,000 stable cash flow, you don&rsquo;t need to reserve that many years of cash. Depending on your comfort level, you can keep, for instance, 5 years of cash or 10% of your total assets in cash as a backup. The rest of your funds can be confidently invested in QQQ and leveraged funds.</li>

<li>Question 1: Most of her funds are in a US retirement account (a Rollover IRA from a 401k) and she was told she cannot use them for a stock pledge loan. This might prevent her from retiring early. How should she handle this?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a common trap. He does not recommend over-contributing to retirement accounts (like the Mega Backdoor Roth). The remedy now is: immediately stop contributing more money to the retirement account and focus all your efforts on building a personal brokerage account. At the same time, you should start converting funds from your Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA annually as soon as possible. Within the IRA, you can also allocate: put a small amount in a Roth IRA to buy TQQQ, so the high-growth portion is tax-free; keep the majority in the Traditional IRA holding QQQ or cash, which will reduce the tax burden during conversion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Are JEPQ and JEPI meant to be replacements for QQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Not replacements. They are tools for a specific group of people (retired, insufficient principal, need high cash flow). Those still in the asset accumulation phase should not touch them. The funding allocation order for retirees should be: 1. Meet cash flow needs (JEPQ), 2. Set aside an emergency fund, 3. Only if there is money left over, consider investing in QQQ for growth.</li>

<li>Question 1: In the event of future hyperinflation, which is a better store of value, real estate or stocks? Can the stock market withstand the test?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Stocks are assets. Inflation means money is worthless, but the value of the asset remains. At that time, the price of the asset (stock price) will rise to reflect its real value. Short-term market drops are due to human fear, not value destruction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Is the 10% dividend from JEPQ fixed? If the principal drops from $500,000 to $300,000, will the dividend also decrease proportionally?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Its dividend amount is relatively stable; it does not fluctuate strictly as a percentage of the principal. It&rsquo;s more like an annuity, designed to provide a steady stream of cash flow. So even if the market value drops, the dividend amount you receive will not decrease proportionally.</li>

<li>Question: I&rsquo;m curious why the teacher mentioned a new investment vehicle like JEPQ today.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: It was because of a specific case: a 72-year-old student with only $600,000 in principal who needs $40,000 a year for living expenses. To help solve his problem, I researched high-dividend products and found JEPQ and JEPI to be relatively stable options. This is because they are not purely derivatives; they hold a large amount of real assets (80% index components), so they can be considered. This is to solve the cash flow problem for seniors, not a recommendation for the average investor.</li>

<li>Sharing: He shared the story of a 78-year-old relative in his family who is in financial difficulty due to kidney failure, requiring dialysis three times a week. He advised the relative to sell a piece of ancestral land that generated no cash flow and invest the funds into Taiwan&rsquo;s high-dividend ETF 0056. This would generate nearly 600,000 TWD in annual cash flow (50,000 TWD per month), completely solving her living expenses and allowing her to live with more dignity. He believes that the form of an asset can be changed; converting land into a stock asset that continuously generates cash flow can also be passed down to future generations.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: There is much suffering in the world, but the number of people we can help is limited. You gave excellent advice, but if she is unwilling to sell the land, that is her choice. We can only help those who are willing to be helped. At the same time, he also reminded everyone to protect their kidney health, drink more water, and stay away from junk food and sugary drinks.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>You think what you&rsquo;re doing is moving you towards your goal, but in reality, you&rsquo;re just moving further away from it, and you still think you&rsquo;re heading towards your goal. This is the most frightening thing.
&ndash; Lin</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote profoundly points out the disconnect between the actions and goals of many investors. They engage in speculative, trend-chasing, and other entertainment-like operations, yet expect to achieve long-term, stable financial objectives. Ultimately, they often end up going in the opposite direction, wasting precious time and capital.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stocks are assets&hellip; How much they sell for is determined by you, the asset owner&hellip; As long as you sell (QQQ), you are wrong. Selling at any time is wrong because you are selling too low.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to concerns about inflation, Teacher James emphasized the nature of quality stocks as real assets. Their long-term value will continuously grow, and short-term price fluctuations should not affect the determination to hold. Selling quality assets is equivalent to giving away huge future potential at a low price.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can&rsquo;t save the poor&hellip; 99.99% of people are fated to be poor, it can&rsquo;t be helped. So you should just&hellip; let go.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>While this statement may sound blunt, it reflects a reality in investment education: we can only influence those who are willing to accept and change. For family or friends who are stubborn and dominated by fear, it is better to let go and focus on one&rsquo;s own growth than to persuade them in vain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When people get old, if you don&rsquo;t have money, others might see you as a kind of &rsquo;lower-class elderly&rsquo;.
&ndash; Haoqing</p></blockquote>
<p>This point raised by Haoqing in his sharing very realistically highlights the importance of financial independence in old age. Having a stable cash flow is not just for survival, but for maintaining dignity, avoiding dependency on others, and being at their mercy in one&rsquo;s later years.</p>

<p>This session provided a significant optimization to the smart rebalancing strategy from a more refined and secure perspective, introducing the concept of &ldquo;Flexible Rebalancing.&rdquo; The core idea is to protect cash as a lifeline, preferring to exchange underlying assets for leveraged assets rather than easily tapping into cash reserves when they are insufficient. At the same time, the course demonstrated strong practicality by offering concrete and viable solutions, such as allocating to high-dividend products like JEPQ, for groups facing real-life difficulties (like insufficient retirement funds). Overall, this session not only deepened the theory of asset allocation but also closely integrated the practical financial needs of different life stages, once again emphasizing the core investment principles of long-term holding, risk control, and cash is king.</p>
