<p>This session revolves around risk control and investment strategies, with the core message being that investment success lies not in maximizing returns, but in maximizing the probability of success. It emphasizes avoiding forced interruption of compound growth due to market fluctuations, choosing an investment portfolio that can be held for the long term, and highlights the importance of cash. James announces the discontinuation of short video updates, with future sharing of investment philosophies and case studies through long videos and Saturday briefings.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Discontinuation of Short Videos:</strong> James announces the end of short video updates, with content to be streamlined and condensed into a briefing format, shared and discussed on Saturdays, covering case studies and life philosophies. Short videos have been produced up to March 27th of next year, at which point updates will cease.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritizing Risk Control:</strong> The most important aspect of investing is maximizing the probability of success, not maximizing returns. Risk control aims to safeguard the long-term success of an investment portfolio, avoiding forced exits due to market volatility. It&rsquo;s better to earn less and ensure long-term holding.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Cash:</strong> Sufficient cash is a crucial asset for ensuring the safety of an investment portfolio, allowing investors  to weather periods of significant market decline with peace of mind. It&rsquo;s the key to &ldquo;sleeping well at night.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Stock Pledging:</strong> Stock pledging, if not accompanied by proper asset allocation, carries a substantial risk of bankruptcy. Without adequate financial literacy, it should not be attempted lightly. Especially in Taiwan, borrowing 3 million against 5 million in assets is close to the pledging limit and extremely risky. James emphasizes understanding &ldquo;Scenario 1&rdquo; through &ldquo;Scenario 9&rdquo; and how to respond to different situations.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Asset Allocation:</strong> Proper asset allocation is crucial, tailored to individual circumstances.  Those who don&rsquo;t understand stock pledging should avoid it. Recommendations are provided for different asset levels and retirement statuses:
<ul>
<li><strong>Not retired and with income:</strong> QQQ 60% + QLD 20% + Cash 20%. This is an aggressive investment strategy, with most funds allocated to Nasdaq 100 index funds.</li>
<li><strong>Retired and with sufficient assets (50x annual expenses and above):</strong> QQQ 80% + Cash 20%. Retirees with ample assets can adopt this allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Retired with assets between 20-50x annual expenses:</strong> SPY or High Dividend + Cash 20% (SPY/High Dividend ratio can be adjusted based on specific circumstances). Those who are retired but with insufficient assets can utilize an SPY or High Dividend strategy with a 20% cash allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Retired with assets below 20x annual expenses:</strong> 0056 or SPHD + 5% Cash (conservative strategy).  Individuals with even fewer assets should not engage in stock pledging due to the higher risk, and should adopt a more conservative strategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Beware of Pump-and-Dump Schemes and Scams:</strong>  Listeners are warned to be vigilant against pump-and-dump schemes and scams in the market, not to blindly trust so-called &ldquo;gurus&rdquo; and &ldquo;experts,&rdquo; and to avoid sending money to unknown websites. CLEC does not charge any fees, and all groups are open and transparent.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility is Normal:</strong> The market will eventually rise and continually reach new highs. Investors should remain optimistic and patiently await the growth of their wealth. &ldquo;Investors are always optimistic, always looking towards the sun.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>A-Share Market Volatility:</strong> The A-share market is highly volatile, reminding investors to remain rational and avoid impulsive buying and selling. The government&rsquo;s cooling measures are aimed at the long-term healthy development of the market, not at specific stocks or investors.</li>
<li><strong>Investing is Like Life&rsquo;s Cultivation:</strong> The example of Journey to the West is used to illustrate that both investing and life require continuous learning and progress. Making mistakes is not terrible; the important thing is to learn from them.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> Recommends Professor Zhou Guannan&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Long-Term Investing&rdquo; to learn about investment psychology.</li>
<li><strong>Guidance for Newcomers:</strong> Newcomers are advised to watch YouTube channel videos 00451, 00398 or 00288, as well as videos from 2023 to the present, to understand CLEC&rsquo;s investment philosophy and system.</li>

</h2>
<p><strong>Ethan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Although stock pledging is not available in mainland China, a similar effect can be achieved through the margin financing function of brokerage firms, utilizing the transfer of collateral between margin accounts and regular accounts.</li>
<li>Sharing: The A-share market has experienced significant volatility recently, reminding everyone not to be swayed by market sentiment and to adhere to a long-term investment strategy. Many investors are easily influenced by market emotions, leading to buying high and selling low.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jackie:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Describes her journey from initial skepticism to fully understanding and embracing the concept of long-term Nasdaq investing, including overcoming psychological barriers to finally going all-in on QQQ. This sharing mentions two psychological obstacles overcome: 1. Fear of buying at the highest point; 2. Comparison between investing in real estate and investing in QQQ.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>H:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Recounts her personal experience of investing in popular stocks, and the eventual process of cutting losses and switching to QQQ, emphasizing the importance of cutting losses. Shares her experience of listening to recommendations for popular stocks in 2021, which led to losses, and finally switching to QQQ in 2023.</li>
<li>Question: The ratio of QQQ and QLD is out of balance, how to rebalance?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Suggests using the Smart Rebalancing strategy, transferring 30% of the profits from QLD to SGOV. When the market falls, transfer 2% of the total assets in cash to QLD.  Also recommends that H read articles about Smart Rebalancing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;d like to understand why Tesla has dropped so much.</li>
<li>Also, could the stock market ever really fall to zero?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>James&rsquo; responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tesla&rsquo;s Decline: James stated that he doesn&rsquo;t have a specific opinion on this. Daily fluctuations are unpredictable, and jokingly suggested asking a deity (&ldquo;Third Prince&rdquo;) for a more accurate prediction. He emphasized that investing in individual stocks requires an understanding of the company&rsquo;s business model that surpasses even the CEO&rsquo;s. If you don&rsquo;t have a stronger vision and ability than Elon Musk, you shouldn&rsquo;t be investing in Tesla. Market ups and downs are not the primary concern; understanding the company&rsquo;s value and long-term plan is crucial.</li>
<li>Stock Market Crashing to Zero: James explained that &ldquo;the market falling to zero&rdquo; is a figure of speech. It refers to a situation where the market might not literally hit zero, but it falls to a point where selling is impractical or impossible. There&rsquo;s a possibility of market closures, like what happened during 911. Closure is equivalent to zero in that context. He highlighted the importance of cash reserves, as they are essential for sustaining living expenses during market downturns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Uses the mural story from Journey to the West as an analogy for the investment journey, from the initial excitement of entering the market to the pain of being trapped, and finally to the enlightenment of finding the correct investment method.</li>
<li>Question: How to persuade friends who spend money lavishly?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Explain the concept of long-term investing and show them the long-term upward trend of the market, illustrating that even small investments can accumulate wealth over time. If they still can&rsquo;t understand, then there&rsquo;s nothing more that can be done.</li>
<li>Question: How to control one&rsquo;s own lavish spending?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Within the scope of risk control, it&rsquo;s normal for living standards to improve as wealth grows. The key is not to exceed one&rsquo;s own capabilities and to avoid selling stocks as much as possible. Spending money is a form of self-cultivation; it&rsquo;s important to live within one&rsquo;s means.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ming:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: A series of questions about retirement accounts, stock pledging, cash allocation, etc. Ming has 3.3 million in assets, of which 2 million are in brokerage, 300,000 in Roth, and 1 million in a traditional account, with a monthly mortgage payment of 125,000.</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Provides detailed answers to Ming&rsquo;s questions and offers specific asset allocation advice based on her situation, including the allocation of brokerage, Roth, and traditional accounts, and how to utilize stock pledging and borrowing to reduce tax burden. Recommends brokerage 100% SPY, Roth 100% TQQQ, traditional 60% cash + 40% SPY.  Also suggests that Ming engage in stock pledging and use borrowed funds to cover living expenses and taxes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sara:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: As a 1099 worker nearing retirement, how to carry out asset allocation and borrow for investment?</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Since Sara lacks sufficient understanding of concepts like stock pledging, it&rsquo;s recommended that she not borrow money and adopt a simple allocation of 80% QQQ + 20% cash, with the cash portion allocated to BOXS. Also advises Sara to rebalance annually.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Questions about borrowing for investment, cash allocation, tax optimization, etc. Tom is concerned about the interest expenses and high tax rates associated with long-term borrowing, and how to maintain sufficient cash in brokerage accounts.</li>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Suggests that Tom keep leveraged funds and cash primarily in retirement accounts and engage in pledging operations based on specific circumstances. Emphasizes the flexibility of Roth accounts and the ability to transfer funds to brokerage accounts in emergencies. Explains that the interest calculation method is an estimate and doesn&rsquo;t need to be overly precise. Also recommends that Tom use Roth account funds for investing in TQQQ, traditional accounts for holding cash, and brokerage accounts for investing in QQQ and engaging in pledging.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make getting rich your goal, but rather strive not to die impoverished.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Investing is for a better life, not for becoming a billionaire. A sound investment strategy is more important than pursuing high returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the right understanding of the stock market, you&rsquo;ll become a victim. The stock market is a scam.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasizes the importance of investor education and the risks present in the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A rotten apple won&rsquo;t get better, and a broken elevator won&rsquo;t fix itself.
&mdash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uses an analogy to illustrate the risk of individual stock investing and the importance of cutting losses in a timely manner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Market fluctuations can sometimes exceed your imagination. If, midway, due to a sharp decline caused by fluctuations, you exit the market out of fear, or are forced to exit, the initially projected performance of your investment portfolio, no matter how good, will be useless.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Highlights the importance of risk control. Even if the expected return is high, if you can&rsquo;t withstand the risk, you may ultimately end up losing everything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human nature is what it is, but you must learn to control it.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Points out the importance of controlling human nature and emotions in investing.</p>
