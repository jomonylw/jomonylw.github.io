      <description>In this episode, Teacher James first shares his personal health experience in treating sleep apnea, followed by another strong warning about the huge risks for non-US tax residents investing in the US, including the 40% estate tax and account freezing issues. The teacher provides a detailed analysis of the dividend composition of the high-dividend ETF QQQI, and expounds on the rebalancing strategy for the 433 asset allocation after asset growth, emphasizing the core principle of &amp;#39;borrowing without repaying&amp;#39; in stock pledging. The Q&amp;amp;A session delves into asset allocation, investment mindset shifts, and the impact of the AI era on social structure.</description>

<p>The core of this classroom session lies in reiterating and deepening the channel&rsquo;s highest guiding principle of investment: &ldquo;Buy whenever you have money, never sell.&rdquo; Through specific cases and analyses, Teacher James emphasizes the inevitability of long-term holding of high-quality assets represented by the Nasdaq 100 Index. At the same time, he dissects in detail the potential huge risks for non-US residents investing in the US, and provides clear strategic guidance on how to use stock pledging and high-dividend ETFs to build a stable retirement cash flow, aiming to help investors establish a financial system that allows them to enjoy life with peace of mind without being anxious about market fluctuations.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Problem &amp; Harm</strong>: Teacher James had long been troubled by snoring problems and later realized their severity. Snoring (Sleep Apnea) leads to reduced blood oxygen concentration at night (he personally dropped as low as 83%). Long-term effects can trigger health risks such as insulin resistance, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, and even dementia.</li>
<li><strong>Treatment Plan</strong>: Through a dentist specializing in sleep therapy (Dr. Hsu at Caipin Dental Clinic), he underwent corrective treatment using a customized oral appliance (mouthpiece). The cost was about 50,000 to 60,000 TWD. This method does not require surgery and is suitable for moderate-level problems.</li>
<li><strong>Significant Results</strong>: After treatment, sleep quality improved drastically, and snoring almost completely disappeared. Comparing data from the <code>SnoreLab</code> App and <code>Apple Watch</code>: before treatment, snoring time accounted for 17% of sleep time with frequent awakenings; after treatment, the snoring ratio dropped to 0-1%, with continuous and deep sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Advice</strong>: The teacher suggests that friends with similar troubles take this issue seriously. You can use apps like <code>SnoreLab</code> for preliminary detection and consult professional sleep specialists; dental correction might be a relatively simple initial solution.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Core Warning</strong>: Teacher James, in a very serious tone, emphasized again that <strong>Non-US tax residents (those without US citizenship or Green Card) must absolutely not open accounts with US brokerages (such as Schwab, IBKR, Fidelity, etc.) to invest or buy real estate in their personal names.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Three Core Risks</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>High Estate Tax</strong>: Once the asset owner passes away, their assets in the US will face an estate tax of up to 40%.</li>
<li><strong>Account Freezing Risk</strong>: US financial regulation is very strict, and accounts can be frozen at any time for various reasons. For example:
<ul>
<li>The bank cannot contact the person (emails bounced, phone numbers invalid).</li>
<li>The actual flow of funds in the account does not match the purpose declared at opening (e.g., large investment sums moving in and out of an account declared for living expenses).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Extremely Complex Inheritance Procedures</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The inheritance process is cumbersome, requiring a large number of documents like death certificates and household registers, which need notarization and English translation, and finally authentication by the US Consulate in the local area.</li>
<li>Inheritance requires going through the US court&rsquo;s &ldquo;Probate&rdquo; process, taking at least six months or more.</li>
<li>Heirs usually need to hire US lawyers to handle it, which is costly and complex, potentially leading family members to give up inheritance, resulting in the assets vanishing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is absolutely no need to take this risk. Investors should buy ETF products tracking the Nasdaq 100 Index through local brokerages in their own country or region.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dividend Source Structure</strong>: QQQI&rsquo;s dividends do not rely entirely on profit distributions from constituent companies. Its composition is relatively complex and stable, coming mainly from three aspects:
<ol>
<li><strong>Actual Dividends</strong>: Dividends distributed by the 80% QQQ it holds.</li>
<li><strong>Option Strategy Income</strong>: Income (premiums) generated by selling Covered Calls and Call Spreads. This part of the income is usually correlated with central bank interest rate levels.</li>
<li><strong>Rebalancing &amp; Stabilization Fund</strong>: When the held QQQ appreciates significantly due to market rise, fund managers will sell a portion of the stocks to convert profits into cash, used to distribute dividends stably, acting similarly to a stabilization fund.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Purpose &amp; Trade-off</strong>: The goal of QQQI is to provide investors with stable, predictable cash flow. To achieve this, it sacrifices some capital appreciation (since it only holds 80% of QQQ, its Beta is about 0.8). Its total return will be slightly lower than QQQ, but for retirees who need stable living expenses, this is worth it.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rebalancing After Asset Appreciation</strong>: When assets using the 433 allocation grow significantly (e.g., from $1 million to $5 million), the &ldquo;autopilot system&rdquo; can be reset to improve quality of life.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Assets at 5 million, existing loan at 250k. You can take 500k (twice the loan amount) from the 5 million and put it into a Money Market Fund as a new cash reserve. The remaining 4.5 million is then allocated via 433. This way, annual disposable living expenses can be calculated at 2% of the new total asset value, i.e., $100,000 (5M * 2%), significantly improving quality of life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Core Principle of Stock Pledging: Borrow But Do Not Repay</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Wrong Operation</strong>: <strong>Absolutely do not use your cash reserves (Money Market Fund) to repay the stock pledge loan.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reason</strong>: Once you use cash to repay, your asset allocation ratio is destroyed. The reduction in the cash portion causes the risk (Beta) of the entire portfolio to rise from the original 0.9 to 1.11, significantly increasing volatility and violating the original intention of asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Mindset</strong>: People who pledge stocks should &ldquo;ignore interest.&rdquo; Because the interest generated by your cash portion (e.g., 3%) and the returns generated by the investment portion (e.g., 15%) are far higher than the loan interest you pay (e.g., 6-7%). The core function of cash reserves is for rebalancing during market downturns, not for repayment.</li>

<li><strong>Share</strong>: Previously, her husband was very conflicted about how to build a position, but recently finally allocated all funds. After completion, the whole person became calm and reassured. Family financial anxiety disappeared, and they felt unprecedented freedom. They no longer feel guilty about spending, nor do they feel the need to sell more physical labor (like part-time jobs) to make money. Quality of life and mindset have improved greatly.

<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Comment</strong>: This is exactly the goal of our channel—to let everyone have peace of mind and not be trapped by money. The purpose of life is not to work, but to enjoy life.

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: After retirement, there are still individual stocks with high profits accounting for about ten-plus percent of total assets (such as Tesla, Google, Microsoft) in the account. How should they be handled?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: There are two options.
<ol>
<li><strong>Sell Immediately</strong>: Sell it all at once and pay the 15% long-term capital gains tax. The advantage is it&rsquo;s simple and done once and for all.</li>
<li><strong>Sell in Batches</strong>: Wait until the Roth Conversion is fully completed in 7-8 years. When personal income decreases, sell stocks in batches annually utilizing the tax-free allowance for long-term capital gains (about $60,000 for singles, deducting Social Security and other income) to save on taxes. But this method is more troublesome. The teacher leans towards the first option for simplicity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Due to high taxes and health insurance payments after retirement, annual expenses have increased, causing total assets to be slightly lower than 33 times annual expenses. Can stock pledging still be done?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: Absolutely. You can still borrow via pledging to pay taxes and living expenses. If the required withdrawal ratio is higher than the standard 2% of the 433 allocation, you can adjust the asset allocation appropriately. For example, increase the proportion of high-dividend QQQI in the retirement account. QQQI will generate stable cash flow to replenish your cash pool, which effectively lowers the risk (Beta) of the entire portfolio, thereby allowing you to safely increase the borrowing ratio (e.g., up to 3%).</li>

<li><strong>Share</strong>: After learning investment concepts, her mindset underwent a huge shift. She no longer bargains when buying things but feels grateful to merchants, practicing the mindset of a &ldquo;rich person.&rdquo; She started teaching her children to save from a young age and invest in 00662 (Nasdaq 100 ETF in Taiwan stocks), using incentives to encourage them to save. She also shared her experience of spreading these concepts to friends, realizing that everyone&rsquo;s timing for &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo; is different, but insisting on planting seeds always brings hope.

<li><strong>Share</strong>: As a doctor, he provided professional supplementation on the sleep apnea mentioned by Teacher James. He explained the three types: obstructive, central, and mixed, emphasized long-term harms (such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s), and introduced different treatment methods, including oral appliances, CPAP machines, surgery, etc. He advised people with symptoms to see a doctor.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Comment</strong>: Thanks to Dr. Henry for the professional addition, and emphasized again that everyone should take this issue seriously and seek professional medical help.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong> (Asked by Su): A friend used a CPAP machine for a year and the problem was solved, but recently the doctor asked him to use it again. Why?
<ul>
<li><strong>Dr. Henry&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: CPAP is assisted breathing and usually cannot cure the disease itself unless the problem was caused by obesity and weight loss was successful. If weight rebounds, the problem may recur. If symptoms persist, continuous use or other treatment options like surgery are needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong> (Asked by Houqin): If surgery is needed, what specific part is treated?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: (Answering briefly on behalf) Generally, it involves removing excess soft tissue in the throat to widen the airway. However, the specific situation is very professional, and it is recommended to consult a specialist directly.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: As a new investor from mainland China, with total assets of about 700k RMB dispersed across IB, domestic brokerages, and HSBC Hong Kong. Since the asset amount is small, is asset allocation necessary? How should the leverage part be operated?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Account Adjustment</strong>: You should transfer assets from IB to HSBC Hong Kong as soon as possible to avoid US estate tax and account risks.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation</strong>: You can buy the Nasdaq 100 2x Leveraged ETF listed in Hong Kong via HSBC, but the leveraged position should not exceed 20% of total assets. Before starting to pledge for living expenses, there is no need to frequently rebalance the leverage part.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Position</strong>: For the cash part in the Hong Kong account, you can consult HSBC to see which money market funds (such as CSOP US Dollar Money Market Fund, 9096 or 3096) are eligible for pledging.</li>

<li><strong>Share</strong>: Shared a story about a Cuban contractor friend who brought his entire family of 27 to the US, bearing all expenses alone, facing huge financial pressure, reflecting the complexity of immigration issues.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: Since the investment portfolio (QQQ, QLD, Cash) itself generates dividends and interest, and these cash flows might already be enough for living, why not use this money directly instead of borrowing and paying interest?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: This is a core conceptual error. <strong>Absolutely do not spend your own money (including dividends and interest)!</strong> Your money is a &ldquo;Golden Goose&rdquo; that can generate money and should be continuously invested in the market to obtain an annualized return of about 15%. The cost of borrowing is only 6-7%. Spending your own dividends is equivalent to giving up higher returns, which is not cost-effective at all.</li>

<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: After entering the AI society, with a large population unemployed, how will they consume without income? How will society function?

A large unemployed population will be &ldquo;kept/fed&rdquo; (like in a zoo), with basic food, clothing, housing, and transportation guaranteed by surplus products created by AI, but they will have no right to choose. Capitalists who own assets (us investors) can use wealth to buy scarce resources and services, living a life of free choice. From a grander philosophical level, humanity&rsquo;s historical mission might be to nurture AI, a higher species, as our &ldquo;next generation.&rdquo;</li>

<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: This is indeed unusual. According to passive index rules, the company with the smallest market cap is usually removed. Removing a company with a high market cap ranking might involve human judgment, which contradicts the concept of a passive index. The teacher stated that further research into the specific reasons is needed, but this does not affect our long-term confidence in the index.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Share 1</strong>: Shared the experience of his friend within the &ldquo;system&rdquo; in China. Because this friend could not bypass the firewall to get outside information, he listened to his wife and invested in Chinese real estate, resulting in assets falling from a peak of nearly 60 million RMB to less than 20 million; meanwhile, the portion invested in 513100 (A-share Nasdaq ETF) following Mike&rsquo;s advice performed excellently, forming a sharp contrast. This highlights the importance of accessing correct information and cognition.</li>
<li><strong>Share 2</strong>: Shared that his doctor friend was skeptical about Google AlphaFold (protein folding prediction), arguing that &ldquo;humans can&rsquo;t even synthesize artificial starch, how can they analyze all proteins.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo; Reply</strong>: These are two completely unrelated things. One cannot use a bottleneck in one field to negate a breakthrough in another.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Investing makes you wealthy, but borrowing makes you a tycoon.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When answering student Lily&rsquo;s question about &ldquo;what he would say to his younger self if he could go back,&rdquo; the teacher emphasized the huge amplifying effect of using leverage early on for wealth growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have stock pledging, don&rsquo;t spend a single dime of your own assets. Why spend your own money? Your money can be invested for a 15% return, while borrowing only costs you 6% or 7%.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: In response to student Houqin&rsquo;s question about &ldquo;why not live off dividends instead of borrowing,&rdquo; the teacher hit the nail on the head regarding the opportunity cost of spending dividends, which is the core logic of the stock pledging strategy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not borrowing is where the risk lies; borrowing is actually lower risk.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Re-emphasizing that borrowing (pledging) under reasonable allocation carries lower risk than using principal (including dividends), because the latter destroys asset allocation and increases portfolio volatility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We rely on the 100 strongest companies in the US; there is no investment more stable than this.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When commenting on student Laurence&rsquo;s share, the teacher explained the source of confidence in investing in the Nasdaq 100 Index: trusting the long-term creativity of the top tier of human enterprises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are not a US tax resident; do not open an account with a US brokerage to invest, and do not buy assets in the US. Understood?
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: The teacher used an extremely serious and repetitive tone to emphasize the severe risks of direct investment in the US for non-US residents. This is an important reminder for all overseas investors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, after putting all my funds into QQQ with these asset allocations, I have &lsquo;done what had to be done, subject to no further becoming&rsquo; (所作已办，不受后有). That is, there will be no more troubles of greed, anger, and ignorance following me.
&ndash; Lily</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Lily shared her understanding of the teacher&rsquo;s &ldquo;Formless Investment&rdquo; philosophy, combining it with the Buddhist state of liberation from afflictions, vividly describing the inner peace brought by index investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We humans are not born to work&hellip; slowly let money work for us, so we can retire with stability and live what we call freedom.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: The teacher encouraged the student couple, explaining that the true meaning of financial freedom is liberating time and life to do what one truly wants, rather than being burdened by work for a lifetime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I am old, when I become a grandmother&hellip; I want to be a rich grandma.
&ndash; Shu</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Shu shared her beautiful vision for the future, hoping that through investment, she will not only make herself wealthy but also benefit her descendants, becoming a generous elder with financial confidence.</p>

<p>This episode, ranging from personal health to global macroeconomics, from practical investment to philosophy of life, once again builds a complete and firm investment worldview for us. Teacher James&rsquo; core message remains consistent: find and stick to the simplest and most essential investment truth—<strong>long-term holding and complete trust in index funds composed of top enterprises.</strong> He not only provided the methodology of &ldquo;what to do&rdquo; (buy indices) and &ldquo;how to do it&rdquo; (asset allocation and pledging) but, more importantly, by repeatedly emphasizing the investment risks for non-US residents and the importance of mindset construction, he cleared the most dangerous traps and common ideological obstacles on our investment path. Whether new investors or senior students, everyone can find the guidance and confidence needed for their current stage in this episode, eventually walking towards the path of financial freedom with peace of mind.</p>

      <description>In this episode, Teacher James first emphasizes the risk of community scams and reiterates his core investment philosophy: ignore all market noise and persist in buying and holding index funds. He analyzes in detail the drawbacks of treating real estate as a primary investment, viewing it as a &amp;#39;prison,&amp;#39; and proposes strategies for achieving financial freedom through asset activation (such as selling property to invest in QQQYI to cover rent). The content also covers how to use credit and stock pledging correctly and safely, provides in-depth answers on asset allocation and tax issues for students in different investment stages and regions (Taiwan, China, US, Canada, Australia), and explores views on financial intelligence and life education for the next generation.</description>

<p>The core theme of this episode revolves around adhering to the &ldquo;buy and do not sell&rdquo; index investment discipline and applying it to financial decisions in real life. Teacher James emphasizes that investors should completely ignore all external noise such as market fluctuations, macroeconomics, and corporate earnings reports. He focuses on arguing that young people should prioritize increasing liquid assets rather than purchasing real estate, and shares how to solve housing and living cash flow problems by activating assets (such as selling a house to invest), thereby avoiding the trap of being &ldquo;house rich, cash poor&rdquo; (poor until only a room is left). In addition, the course delves into principles for the safe use of leverage and loans, and how to conduct robust asset allocation based on individual circumstances.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Beware of Scams</strong>: Teacher James first reminded everyone that scam accounts imitating his identity have appeared in the community (e.g., ID <code>clecchermannn</code>). His real ID is <code>cleccherman</code>, and he will never actively contact students privately to recommend investments. Students should contact him through the official Email channel.</li>
<li><strong>The Investor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ignorance&rdquo; Principle</strong>: For index investors, market volatility, international situations, central bank policies, market analysis, corporate earnings, and economic data are irrelevant. The core strategy is to buy the index, hold for the long term, and ignore market ups and downs.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Disclaimer</strong>: All content is for education and experience sharing, not investment advice. Investment risks are extremely high; everyone must self-assess whether they can withstand extreme scenarios where assets may continue to fall for 10 years with a depth of up to 85%.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Governments and Banks Sell Fear</strong>: They often use concepts like &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t buy now, you won&rsquo;t be able to afford it&rdquo; or &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t have a place to live when you&rsquo;re old&rdquo; to create anxiety, urging people to take on mortgages prematurely.</li>
<li><strong>Increase Liquid Assets First, Then Buy a House with Ease</strong>: One should first increase liquid assets through investment. When assets are substantial, buying a house is as simple as buying slippers, and one can even use stock pledging to borrow money for the purchase (&ldquo;empty-handed white wolf&rdquo; strategy) instead of draining one&rsquo;s own cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>A House is a &ldquo;Prison,&rdquo; Not an Asset</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Mindset Trap</strong>: Ordinary people buying a home for self-use is different from a developer&rsquo;s high-turnover business model. Living in it for decades locks up the asset completely, eventually leading to being &ldquo;poor until only a room is left.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty in Liquidation</strong>: Even if the house price rises, it cannot be easily liquidated for living expenses. Transaction costs are high (taxes, agency fees), and the turnover rate is extremely slow.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance Costs</strong>: Old houses face various maintenance issues like leaks, termites, and burst pipes, consuming mental energy.</li>

<li><strong>Case Study: Sell House to Rent, Activate Million-Dollar Assets</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Taking the US as an example, a retiree with a $1 million property should not live a frugal life guarding the house.</li>
<li><strong>Solution</strong>: Sell the $1 million house.
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1 (Solve Housing)</strong>: Take $300,000 and invest in high-dividend products (like QQQYI, 12% annualized yield), generating $36,000 in cash flow annually, sufficient to pay a monthly rent of $3,000. The remaining $700,000 can be used for investment and living.</li>
<li><strong>Option 2 (Solve Housing + Living)</strong>: Take $600,000 to invest in QQQYI, generating $72,000 annually. This not only covers rent but provides an extra $3,000 monthly for living expenses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Core Point</strong>: Why use assets worth $1 million or even $3 million to lock down a problem that can be solved with $300,000? This is the meaning of asset activation.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Correct Use of Credit</strong>: Any loan (credit, mortgage) must be based on &ldquo;stable salary income.&rdquo; After deducting all living expenses, there must still be spare capacity to repay principal and interest. Borrowing limits must never be determined based on how much cash reserve you have.</li>
<li><strong>Be Wary of Loan Models in Different Regions</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Taiwan</strong>: Most credit loans require repayment of principal and interest together, clearing the debt at maturity. This is relatively sound.</li>
<li><strong>Mainland China</strong>: Some credit products are &ldquo;interest-only first, principal repayment at maturity.&rdquo; This is extremely risky during market downturns. If the market is at a low point when the loan matures and is not renewed, investors may be forced to sell assets at a low point to repay, causing huge losses.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Acknowledge the Unknown, Remain Humble</strong>: In front of the market, admit that you &ldquo;know nothing.&rdquo; Avoid overconfidence and attempts to predict the market; this is the foundation for long-term survival in the market.</li>

<li><strong>Temporarily Closing New Memberships</strong>: To let the community return to its original intention of helping newcomers and to improve discussion quality, it was decided to temporarily close new member joins and reorganize internally.</li>
<li><strong>Improving Discussion Methods</strong>: Future newcomers will be guided to use the &ldquo;Threads&rdquo; function for questions, facilitating concentrated and in-depth answers from seniors and preventing chat flooding.</li>

<li>Question: A new student of two weeks in Taiwan, currently investing in high-dividend and market-cap ETFs (ratio 3:2). Has a mortgage but enough funds to pay it off. To retire within 10 years, considering a &ldquo;financial mortgage&rdquo; (interest-only, 7-10 year term) to cash out more funds for investment. Worried that the 10-year loan term is shorter than the 15-year &ldquo;guaranteed profit&rdquo; cycle mentioned by the teacher. If the market drops 85% at maturity and the bank pulls funding leading to bankruptcy, how to resolve this?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Do not recommend financial mortgages</strong>: This type of short-term loan with non-renewal risk is very dangerous. Once unemployed or if the market falls for a long time, you face bankruptcy risk.</li>
<li><strong>Suggest Traditional Mortgage</strong>: Suggest converting the mortgage to a 30-year principal and interest repayment loan. Extend the term as much as possible to lower monthly payments, thereby releasing more cash flow for investment.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Allocation Suggestion</strong>: For funds of 6 million TWD, start with a robust allocation, such as 70% 00662 (tracking Nasdaq 100) and 30% 00865B (Short-term Treasury/Cash). Do not rush into leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Gradually Adapt to Leverage</strong>: Since she previously invested in high-dividend products, her volatility tolerance is unknown. Suggests starting with a 10% position if trying leveraged funds (like 00670L) to personally experience the feeling of a 30%-60% market drop, then adjust gradually.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Sufficient Cash</strong>: Must reserve 2-3 years of living expenses as cash. Overall, a 6:1:3 (60% Market Cap, 10% Leverage, 30% Cash) allocation is a suitable starting point for now.</li>

<li>Question 1: Father has dizziness issues, similar to what the teacher once shared about his own father (carotid artery issue). Asking for the contact of the doctor who performed the stent procedure for the teacher&rsquo;s father.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is experience sharing, not medical advice. He pointed out that such issues should consult &ldquo;Cardiovascular Surgery&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cardiology,&rdquo; not the intuitive &ldquo;Neurology.&rdquo; He found Dr. <strong>Shih Chun-che</strong> (Cardiovascular Surgery) at Taipei Medical University, and the surgery was performed by his brother, Superintendent <strong>Shih Chun-min</strong>, at Wan Fang Hospital. Suggests consulting relevant departments at large teaching hospitals (e.g., NTU, Veterans General, Chang Gung).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: How to educate the next generation (4 years old)? He told his child he doesn&rsquo;t like his job as an engineer and encourages the child to learn arts (piano, dance) or become a dentist, hoping the child won&rsquo;t become a &ldquo;laborer&rdquo; like him and fall into class reproduction.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Correcting &ldquo;Laborer Thinking&rdquo;</strong>: The teacher pointed out sharply that the father&rsquo;s educational method is essentially still &ldquo;laborer thinking&rdquo; because he links interests directly to &ldquo;finding a job that won&rsquo;t be replaced&rdquo; and income.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Should Not equate to Income</strong>: The core of education is guiding children to explore and find what they truly love and want to do as soon as they wake up, not for making a living. Things you like don&rsquo;t necessarily have to have a salary.</li>
<li><strong>Parents are the Backup</strong>: The parents&rsquo; responsibility is to be the safety net during the child&rsquo;s life adventure, providing basic food and shelter.</li>
<li><strong>Cultivate Independence</strong>: After adulthood, children must learn to be responsible for their extra desires (like new phones, travel) and earn money to satisfy them.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Guidance</strong>: Parents should take children to experience the world, not instill concepts of &ldquo;what job is good/bad,&rdquo; and definitely not pass on their own negative emotions about work.</li>

Used this to add a point on child education: The most important role for parents is &ldquo;accompaniment,&rdquo; ensuring the child keeps up with daily learning, especially basics. Once the foundation (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) is not laid well, failing to keep up with later courses leads to a loss of interest in learning, which is more serious than sending them to any cram school.</li>

<li>Question: US citizen planning to retire and live in Taiwan for a few years starting in 2029. Asked about tax issues (whether to pay Taiwan tax), how to file taxes without a US address, and suggestions for Taiwan weather/travel.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Taxes</strong>: She remains a US tax resident and only needs to file US taxes as usual. Since there is no income in Taiwan, Taiwan tax is not involved.</li>
<li><strong>Residency</strong>: Can use visa-free entry for several months, then apply for an extension or do a &ldquo;visa run&rdquo; (travel to a nearby country and return).</li>
<li><strong>Travel Advice</strong>: Weather is best from November to January. Transportation is convenient island-wide; recommends using public transport (like &ldquo;Taiwan Tourist Shuttle&rdquo; buses) to visit Taipei, Sun Moon Lake, Alishan, Hualien/Taitung, etc. International flights arrive at Taoyuan Airport.</li>

<li>Question: Living in Mainland China, investing via a Hong Kong broker. Is QQQYI dividend taxable?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Non-US tax residents buying through US brokers will have 30% tax withheld on dividends, discounting actual returns. Although theoretically one can apply for a tax refund, the process is extremely tedious. He suggests checking if the Hong Kong broker offers services to apply for refunds on your behalf. Meanwhile, he recommended a Mainland China OTC high-dividend fund, <strong>Southern Dividend Low Volatility 50 ETF (Code 008163)</strong>, with an annualized yield of about 10%, as a local alternative.</li>

<li>Question: Why recommend investing in QQQ (Nasdaq 100) instead of S&amp;P 500? Isn&rsquo;t QQQ more volatile?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Because QQQ has a higher long-term return rate. A portfolio of 500 companies is too diversified, affecting overall performance; 100 companies are diversified enough. For &ldquo;buy and hold&rdquo; investors, volatility during the process is not risk and can be completely ignored. Whenever there is money, one should buy.</li>

<li>Question 1: Misunderstood stock pledging. She thought her 4:3:3 combination (400k QQQ, 300k QLD, 300k Cash) allowed her to borrow $540k based on the broker&rsquo;s limit, asking how to use this money.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is an extremely dangerous misunderstanding. Borrowing such a high ratio means immediate bankruptcy if the market drops 80%. <strong>The principle of safe pledging is: borrow at most 2% of total assets annually.</strong> For $1 million in assets, the safe borrowing limit is only $20,000 per year for consumption or reinvestment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: For a retired person, if the 30% cash is only enough for 10 years of living expenses, and part of it is spent when the market falls, is there extra money to &ldquo;buy the dip&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>Non-retirees should not live off investment principal.</li>
<li>For retirees, ideal cash reserves should cover <strong>15 years</strong> of expenses (corresponding to total assets being 50 times annual expenses). If cash only covers 10 years, it means total assets are insufficient to support a leveraged configuration like 4:3:3, and high-dividend ETFs should be added to supplement cash flow.</li>
<li>The 15 years of living expenses used for safety <strong>must never</strong> be used to buy the dip, as this is for survival. Only &ldquo;extra&rdquo; cash beyond 15 years of expenses can be considered for investment during market drops.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is the reality of the financial services industry. The first step in financial management is to stay away from financial advisors and insurance agents. Although they seem to make easy money, they also face pressure from client complaints when the market falls. If Haoqing wants to enter this industry, it is feasible, but he must obtain relevant licenses (like CFA) to operate legally.</li>

<li>Question 1: If one has a separate stable cash reserve, can the investment portfolio be allocated as 60% QQQ and 40% QLD?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You cannot view the investment portfolio in isolation like this. You must calculate the ratio with all assets (including that &ldquo;separate&rdquo; cash) together. For example, if total assets are 1.4 million (of which 400k is cash), then a 700k QQQ and 300k QLD allocation is actually <strong>50% QQQ : 21% QLD : 29% Cash</strong>. This 5:2:3 ratio is reasonable because the leveraged fund (21%) does not exceed cash (29%) or the prototype fund (50%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: In the long run, is QLD&rsquo;s return guaranteed to be better than QQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>Absolutely not.</strong> After a deep bear market, leveraged funds may take decades to recover, while QQQ recovers much faster. The purpose of holding leveraged funds is to harvest profits into QQQ or cash through &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; during bull markets; it is not an asset to be held mindlessly forever. If the position becomes too high, it must be adjusted <strong>immediately</strong>; you cannot wait even one day.</li>

<p>This episode began with a warning about community scams, reinforcing the cornerstones of CLEC investment philosophy—discipline and mindset. Through a profound analysis of the concept of &ldquo;real estate,&rdquo; which is deeply rooted in Chinese society, Teacher James guided everyone to step out of traditional thinking frameworks, truly understand the value of &ldquo;liquid assets,&rdquo; and provided concrete and feasible asset activation plans. The Q&amp;A session covered multiple levels from asset allocation, leverage use, tax planning to children&rsquo;s education. The teacher&rsquo;s replies not only offered operational advice but also conveyed the underlying philosophy of life and risk management thoughts. The entire sharing session warns us that true financial freedom stems from correct cognition, strict discipline, and reverence for risk, rather than chasing or predicting the market.</p>

<li><strong>The Seven Levels of Investment Learning</strong>: The journey from initial exposure to forming an unwavering belief.</li>
<li><strong>The Seven Levels of Wealth Accumulation</strong>: The path from understanding investment to maximizing wealth through concentration, leverage, tax savings, and longevity.</li>
<li><strong>The Seven Levels of Investment Operations</strong>: From the confusion of short-term trading to finally embracing the wealthy class strategy of &ldquo;invest only in indexes, never sell, and live off pledged assets.&rdquo;

<li><strong>Ignore Short-Term Volatility</strong>: The market has been highly volatile recently due to events like US-China tariffs and a potential US government shutdown, but investors should ignore this market noise and avoid making incorrect moves. Typically, any action based on short-term predictions is wrong.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Technical Analysis</strong>: The accuracy of technical analysis is about the same as a coin toss, roughly 50/50, and should not be the primary basis for investment decisions.</li>

<li><strong>AI Makes the Impossible Possible, But Also Makes People Busier</strong>: Technological advancements like AI have made things previously unimaginable (such as quickly creating multilingual videos) possible. However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean people become more idle; on the contrary, they become busier because there are more things they can do.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage Using AI to Spread Correct Investment Philosophies</strong>: Students can use AI tools like NotebookLM or ChatGPT to translate investment philosophies into articles or videos in different languages, helping to &ldquo;inform&rdquo; more people of their right to be wealthy.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Philosophy is Evolving DNA</strong>: Our investment philosophy is constantly evolving and being optimized. For example, it was once emphasized that those who pledge assets &ldquo;must&rdquo; allocate to leveraged funds to maintain returns. The current view, however, is that for the sake of stability, one can pledge assets without holding leveraged funds. Students need to keep up with their learning to avoid sticking to outdated knowledge, as the investment world is like biological evolution—ceasing to evolve risks being eliminated.</li>

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Seven Levels of Investment Learning</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hearing</strong>: Just encountering the information, possibly thinking it&rsquo;s a scam.</li>
<li><strong>Knowing</strong>: Beginning to realize there&rsquo;s substance to it.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding</strong>: Developing cognition after in-depth research.</li>
<li><strong>Believing</strong>: Transitioning from cognition to trust.</li>
<li><strong>Executing</strong>: Putting belief into action, the key being &ldquo;buy when you have money, immediately, at market price.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Enduring</strong>: Being able to withstand the pain and hold on when the market drops by 40% or even more.</li>
<li><strong>Faith</strong>: Reaching a state of inner peace where market fluctuations don&rsquo;t matter. This is usually built on proper asset allocation and sufficient cash flow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Seven Levels of Wealth (Differences in Magnitude)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knowing How to Invest vs. Not Knowing</strong>: This is the first dividing line, separating 90% of the world&rsquo;s population.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Correctly vs. Incorrectly</strong>: Among those who know how to invest, choosing the most efficient assets (e.g., QQQ vs. VOO/VT) can result in a hundredfold difference in assets over the long term.</li>
<li><strong>Han Xin Deploying Troops (Concentrating Capital)</strong>: Concentrating funds in the highest-return assets instead of diversifying into inefficient products like insurance, annuities, and bonds can create another hundredfold gap in assets.</li>
<li><strong>Pledging and Borrowing</strong>: Learning to use stock pledging to obtain liquidity instead of selling assets widens the asset gap again.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing Without Repaying</strong>: Understanding that a pledge loan is an expansion of assets, not a traditional debt that needs to be repaid. Compared to those who rush to repay, the potential for wealth growth is entirely different.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Tax Savings</strong>: Through legal tax planning (like Roth Conversions in the US), one can save enormous amounts in taxes, further widening the wealth gap.</li>
<li><strong>Longevity</strong>: When all the above are done correctly, the longer you live, the more significant the compounding effect, and the more assets you accumulate. Longevity is the key determinant of ultimate wealth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Seven Levels of Investment Operations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level One</strong>: New to the market, occasionally making money on individual stocks, thinking investing is easy.</li>
<li><strong>Level Two</strong>: Trying derivatives like options, possibly profiting in the short term, but likely losing money in the long run.</li>
<li><strong>Level Three</strong>: Starting to study financial reports and industry trends, trying to buy low and sell high, but the more you know, the more you lose.</li>
<li><strong>Level Four</strong>: Obsessed with technical analysis and futures, engaging in frantic short-term trading, thinking you&rsquo;re a stock market guru, but actually being closest to bankruptcy.</li>
<li><strong>Level Five</strong>: Understanding that investing is about sharing in a company&rsquo;s growth and knowing how to pick good companies, but still suffering from the huge volatility of individual stocks. You work like a dog for mediocre returns.</li>
<li><strong>Level Six</strong>: Grasping the power of long-term holding and starting to make big profits, but still needing to constantly research and switch companies. Having cash on hand after selling becomes a new source of anxiety. It&rsquo;s still a busy operational life.</li>
<li><strong>Level Seven (The Ultimate)</strong>: Investing only in index funds (QQQ). Buy whenever you have money, never sell, buy with your eyes closed. Implement proper asset allocation (e.g., 433), keep enough cash, and fear no market crash. Live off loans from stock pledging and never repay them, allowing assets to continuously generate wealth. This is the true wealthy class.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Astonishing Power of Compounding</strong>: Using the example of investing NT$10,000 per month, at an 18% annualized return, it can grow to NT$547 million in 40 years. This shows that becoming wealthy is achievable for ordinary people; it is a &ldquo;God-given&rdquo; right. The key is whether one is informed and takes action.</li>
<li><strong>The Nature of Work and the Meaning of Life</strong>: Our lives should not be solely for work and survival. Viewing one&rsquo;s job as the entirety of life is a form of enslavement by capitalism. Only after being free from work pressure can one truly understand what &ldquo;life&rdquo; is and pursue what one loves, like gardening or enjoying a pastoral life.</li>
<li><strong>The Risks of Leveraged ETFs</strong>: One must deeply understand the nature of leveraged ETFs (like TQQQ). They can bring tenfold returns in the short term but can also drop to zero (a 99.999% decline) in a single major crash. Therefore, their risk must be managed through asset allocation and rebalancing; never go all-in.</li>

<li>Share: She recently heard a story that Tony Robbins suggests two things for success: first, imitate someone you want to become; second, practice positive meditation daily. She applied this to herself by imitating James, practicing the seven levels of investing step-by-step—from understanding investing and doing it right to pledging assets without repayment—and believes she is on the right path. She also mentioned that Taiwan&rsquo;s inheritance tax is very low.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He agrees that Taiwan&rsquo;s inheritance tax is low (maximum 20%), so there&rsquo;s no need for complex trusts or planning. The best &ldquo;tax avoidance&rdquo; is to &ldquo;have many children and grandchildren&rdquo; and use the annual gift tax exemption to transfer wealth to future generations early, which has an amazing compounding effect. He shared a cautionary tale of a bank deceiving a family into taking out a massive loan to &ldquo;plan&rdquo; for inheritance tax, warning that bank promotions can sometimes be scams.</li>

<li>Share: He has opened Custodial Accounts for his three young children, with a portfolio of 60% QQQ, 20% QLD, and 20% SGOV. He plans to invest small amounts regularly. His goal is not to give them a certain amount of money but to &ldquo;teach them how to fish,&rdquo; allowing them to see the account grow from a young age and giving him the opportunity to teach them the complete financial system in the future, including Pledge Loans. This is both a transfer of wealth and wisdom.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He strongly agrees with this educational approach. He pointed out that gifting early is the best estate planning. For example, giving a daughter $20,000 annually for 40 years could grow to nearly $100 billion at an 18% return, completely tax-free, which is far more significant than worrying about the inheritance tax exemption amount.</li>

<li><strong>Han Xin Deploying Troops</strong>: Following James&rsquo;s advice, he canceled unnecessary investment-linked insurance policies, sold an idle property in Taiwan to invest in US index funds, and did not rush to pay off his mortgage. These three decisions significantly improved his financial situation.</li>
<li><strong>Evolution of Investment Philosophy</strong>: He recalled that he initially only learned to &ldquo;Buy and Hold SPY,&rdquo; which was just 1/5 of the entire system.

<li>Question: Regarding the Traditional IRA, some suggest holding cash in it so the future tax base is low. But she thought if she put it all in QQQ, although the future tax would be higher, the growth would also be much higher than cash. Isn&rsquo;t that better?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a balance between risk and taxes. James provided a strategy: suppose you convert $100,000 to a Roth account annually. You could buy $100,000 of TQQQ (3x leverage) in the Roth. To balance the risk of the entire portfolio, you could hold $200,000 in cash in your Traditional IRA. This way, your high-growth component (TQQQ) is in the tax-free Roth account, while the cash in the Traditional IRA hedges the risk. This optimizes the tax structure without reducing the overall return potential.</li>

The friend initially claimed she could tolerate a 50% fluctuation, but when told the loss could last for 3-5 years, she immediately said she couldn&rsquo;t accept it; her bottom line was not losing principal for more than 1-2 years. Through this conversation, Ling deeply realized that everyone&rsquo;s definition of and tolerance for &ldquo;risk&rdquo; is completely different. Before taking any investment action (like buying immediately at market price), the first task is to thoroughly understand what level of risk you can truly bear.

<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: He highly praised Ling&rsquo;s clear logic. He emphasized that knowing your own risk tolerance is the first step in investing, more important than any strategy. He used the 2000 dot-com bubble as an example, where QQQ took 15 years to return to its high, which is why he recommends keeping enough cash for 15-20 years. <strong>&ldquo;Survival is more important than making money.&rdquo;</strong> Before you understand yourself, you should keep more cash; the rate of return is not the top priority.</li>

<ul>

The US debt problem could be resolved by productivity gains from AI (e.g., an extra 1.5% GDP growth annually). 2. A thought experiment: If the US government announced a &ldquo;ban on using US dollars for gold transactions,&rdquo; the entire dollar-denominated gold market would collapse instantly, and the value of gold hoarded by countries would plummet. The US has many tools left in its toolbox to maintain its hegemony. The disputes between the US and China over chips and rare earths are games between nations and do not affect our long-term confidence in US technological development, which is unrelated to investing in QQQ.</li>

Background: In explaining his life philosophy, James criticized the idea of &ldquo;living to work,&rdquo; believing that only by breaking free from the shackles of work can one truly experience and understand the meaning of life.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Survival is more important than making money.
&ndash; James
Background: When commenting on Ling&rsquo;s case study about risk perception, James emphasized that survival is the first principle of investing. Managing risk and keeping sufficient cash is far more important than chasing short-term high returns.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s understanding of risk can be completely different&hellip; You must first figure out what you consider to be risk before you allocate your assets.
&ndash; Ling
Background: Ling shared her experience helping a novice investor friend and discovered a huge gap between the friend&rsquo;s stated risk tolerance and her actual psychological bottom line, leading to this conclusion.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AI will confidently spout nonsense&hellip; In the world today, there is some information&hellip; that is prone to this kind of mutual contamination.
&ndash; Julia
Background: Julia shared her pitfalls when using AI to research complex tax issues, finding that AI and incorrect online information form a vicious cycle, mutually citing and amplifying errors.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Invest only in index funds, buy whenever you have money and never sell, buy with your eyes closed&hellip; Do your asset allocation&hellip; live off loans from stock pledging, and never repay them.
&ndash; James
Background: When summarizing the seventh and highest level of investment operations, James used this phrase to encapsulate the essence of the strategy for achieving ultimate financial freedom.</p></blockquote>

<p>This session was a systematic and in-depth review of investment philosophy and life-wealth concepts. Through a clear, three-tiered &ldquo;seven-level ladder&rdquo; model, James constructed a complete growth blueprint for listeners, from investment novice to wealthy magnate. The course not only taught &ldquo;what to do&rdquo; (invest in indexes, don&rsquo;t sell, use pledging wisely) but also profoundly explained &ldquo;why to do it&rdquo; (understand risk, ignore noise, believe in compounding) and the ultimate goal (achieve freedom in life, not be enslaved by work). The students&rsquo; sharing and questions—from practical operations to macroeconomics and the critical use of AI tools—greatly enriched the breadth and depth of the discussion, once again confirming that investment success ultimately stems from continuous learning, deep self-awareness, and a firm philosophical belief.</p>

      <description>This session&amp;#39;s core sharing focuses on shifting from a labor mindset to a rich mindset, learning how to leverage financial operations to consume with hundreds of times more assets than one&amp;#39;s own small capital, achieving continuous asset growth without selling. Teacher James elaborates on the importance of focusing on investing in the Nasdaq 100 index and refutes the drawbacks of other investment methods and financial products. The Q&amp;amp;A session delves into practical operational issues such as asset allocation, stock-backed loans, insurance, and cross-border asset management.</description>

<p>The core theme of this session is to <strong>break free from a labor mindset and establish a rich mindset</strong>. Traditional wisdom suggests that one needs to work hard, save money, and invest to get rich, while the core of a rich mindset is understanding how to utilize financial leverage. Teacher James illustrates with specific examples how a small principal (e.g., $30,000) can be used to spend far more than the principal (e.g., $1,000,000) through long-term low-interest borrowing (such as stock-backed loans), while the principal itself compounds in the market over the long term, with its future value sufficient to cover all debts. This financial operation of &ldquo;borrowing to spend, never selling assets&rdquo; is where the real big money is, far superior to the &ldquo;peanuts&rdquo; earned from stock picking and short-term trading.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on one, eliminate distractions</strong>: The only investment target is the Nasdaq 100 index fund (e.g., QQQ). Ignore market fluctuations, financial news, analyst opinions, financial reports, and any other recommended ETFs (such as VT, SPY, VTI, and various 0098x and other &ldquo;demonic&rdquo; codes in Taiwan). The teacher guarantees with 40+ years of investment experience that if there were a better target, he would have recommended it long ago.</li>
<li><strong>Trust in predecessors&rsquo; experience, avoid self-trial and error</strong>: Beginners should first accept the warning &ldquo;don&rsquo;t touch fire,&rdquo; meaning don&rsquo;t touch investment targets not recommended by the teacher. Asking questions won&rsquo;t teach you anything; you should calmly watch hundreds of videos first, and then the questions you have will be genuine. Learning from the wisdom and experience of predecessors (e.g., reading classics like &ldquo;Tao Te Ching,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Bible&rdquo;) can help avoid detours, which is the cheapest way to learn in life.</li>
<li><strong>Be highly vigilant of the financial system</strong>: You&rsquo;re alert when you receive a scam call, but you completely trust what financial advisors and insurance agents tell you, and that&rsquo;s the scariest scam. View the <strong>financial industry, insurance industry, and government</strong> as a united potential &ldquo;scam group,&rdquo; and be vigilant about any products they recommend.</li>
<li><strong>Advice for newcomers</strong>: New friends can start by watching video <strong>00451</strong> on our YouTube channel to build a basic understanding.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Consolidation</strong>: All funds and individual stocks should be converted into an asset allocation based on QQQ.</li>
<li><strong>Account Configuration Recommendations for US Investors</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Leveraged Funds (QLD, TQQQ)</strong>: Should be 99.99% placed in tax-advantaged retirement accounts (e.g., Roth IRA).</li>
<li><strong>Cash</strong>: Can be placed in any account, but for different purposes.
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash in Roth accounts</strong>: Used for &ldquo;smart rebalancing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Cash in Stock-Backed Loan Accounts (Pledge Account)</strong>: Used to reduce account volatility and prevent margin calls.</li>
<li><strong>Cash in Taxable Accounts or Traditional IRA</strong>: Used to slow down the appreciation rate of that account, which helps with tax planning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Warning for Non-US Residents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not open accounts with US brokers</strong>: Non-US tax residents will face up to 40% estate tax on assets in the US, and accounts may be frozen at any time. The process for descendants to handle inheritance is extremely cumbersome and complex, and lawyer fees may deplete most of the assets.</li>
<li><strong>Keep money close</strong>: Assets should remain in your country of residence. If you live in Taiwan, keep your money in Taiwan; if you live in Hong Kong, keep your money in Hong Kong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Financial Education</strong>: Educating children about finance is more important than academic performance. Children can have poor grades, they can be lazy, but they cannot be ignorant of financial management. In a capitalist society, knowing how to grow assets is more crucial than having a high degree but being a &ldquo;pauper.&rdquo; Cultivate independent thinking and judgment.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Misconceptions of traditional labor mindset</strong>: Believing that one must work hard, save diligently, and invest diligently to have money to spend. This is a passive and inefficient mindset that prevents an easy life.</li>
<li><strong>Core of Rich Mindset – Financial Operations</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>The Art of Borrowing</strong>: The core of borrowing is not to consider the interest rate first, but that the <strong>loan term should be as long as possible</strong>. If a loan can be repaid principal and interest in 40 years, even if the interest rate is as high as 8%, it&rsquo;s worth borrowing because inflation and asset appreciation will far exceed the interest cost.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging Small Capital for Large Assets</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: You currently have $30,000. At an annualized return of 15%, it will grow to nearly $7,000,000 in 40 years. Based on this enormous future asset, you now have the ability to borrow $1,000,000 to spend, as long as this loan is long-term, or even never requires principal repayment (like a stock-backed loan). Your asset growth rate will exceed your debt growth rate.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Don&rsquo;t spend your $30,000; let it snowball. The money you spend is borrowed. This is the essence of financial operations, which involves tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stop Focusing on Small Money</strong>: Don&rsquo;t dwell on stock picking, short-term trading, and other behaviors aimed at earning price differences. These are insignificant like sesame seeds compared to the grand scope of financial operations.</li>

<li>Question 1: Regarding workplace salary, I asked my boss for a $20,000 raise and a $50,000 bonus. My boss agreed to the raise but refused the bonus, which I accepted. I felt that the long-term nature of salary was more important than a one-time bonus. I&rsquo;d like to ask for Teacher James&rsquo;s opinion.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your decision was absolutely correct. Supervisors are usually willing to give raises because the money belongs to the company, not them personally. A fixed salary increase is permanent, while a bonus is one-time and can be canceled by the company at any time. This aligns with our philosophy of long-term investing, which seeks stable and continuous growth (15% annually) rather than short-term spikes (a single day&rsquo;s surge). You&rsquo;ve grasped the key point.</li>

<li>Share 1: I only discovered the teacher&rsquo;s channel in late August and felt like I&rsquo;d struck gold. Within a week, I invested all my funds into the market and plan to invest the money from cashing out my endowment insurance.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Excellent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Share 2: I shared the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy with a beauty industry group I founded, hoping my peers could also benefit, as many in our industry receive advance payments from clients, which serves as excellent interest-free cash flow for investment. However, some people left the group as soon as they heard about investing, which made me feel frustrated and regretful.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: This is a very typical reaction. Topics like investing and politics should not be shared casually in non-homogeneous groups. Every group has its inherent attributes, and abruptly introducing unrelated topics, like discussing politics in a group, will inevitably cause a &ldquo;commotion.&rdquo; You must anticipate such a reaction. Also, a reminder: for advance payments received by businesses, you need to reserve sufficient working capital for operations and not over-invest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 1: A client of mine, almost 50 years old, thinks this investment method is too slow and that one doesn&rsquo;t have many 40-year periods in life. I&rsquo;d like to hear the teacher&rsquo;s insights. Also, should the funds from my surrendered endowment insurance all be invested in 00865B (Taiwanese short-term government bond ETF) as cash, or do I need to keep some in a savings account at the bank?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Regarding your client&rsquo;s question, this is a difference in mindset. For fund allocation, cash does not need to be kept in the bank. 00865B has excellent liquidity; if you sell today, the money arrives the day after tomorrow, so it can be used entirely as cash. For daily expenses, try to use credit cards, and then sell 00865B once to repay the bill. Your subsequent income can be vaguely and randomly invested into 00662, 00670L, and 00865B, no need to be overly precise, for example, rotating among the three every four months.</li>

<li>Question 1: I&rsquo;m 53. Due to government housing policies, I&rsquo;m considering selling my self-occupied home in Taoyuan at a low price and renting instead, which would give me about 5 million in cash. Should I use this money to pay off my car loan and personal loan first, and then invest the remaining money using a 70/30 or 60/13/30 strategy? Also, I pay a lot for insurance every month, and some policies are nearing their maturity. What should I do?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You can sell the house and invest the money. But <strong>absolutely do not use the money from selling the house to pay off any loans</strong>. Borrowed money is &ldquo;someone else&rsquo;s chicken&rdquo;; let it lay eggs. Your own money is &ldquo;your own chicken&rdquo;; let it lay eggs too. Use your future salary from re-entering the workforce to make monthly installment payments. For insurance, <strong>immediately, right now, surrender all of it</strong>; take back whatever you can. As long as you stop paying, you win, and you&rsquo;ll have tens of millions more in the future.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Regarding the order of placing leveraged funds in accounts, why would Traditional IRA/401k be prioritized over a Brokerage Account? This seems to contradict the idea of &ldquo;putting cash in a Traditional account to slow appreciation.&rdquo; Moreover, future withdrawals from Traditional accounts are taxed at Income Tax rates, which are higher than Brokerage&rsquo;s Capital Gain Tax rates.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This question is more complex. The core reasons are: 1) Leveraged funds cannot be used for stock-backed loans. Placing leveraged funds in a Brokerage account would &ldquo;pollute&rdquo; this account, which might be used for pledging in the future. 2) Leveraged funds have high volatility and will inevitably require rebalancing, which would incur taxes if done in a Brokerage account. Although the future tax rate in a Traditional account is higher, it provides a &ldquo;tax deferral&rdquo; effect, allowing you to operate freely internally without tax worries. More importantly, you don&rsquo;t need to allocate leverage in every account. <strong>The core is to maintain the overall investment portfolio&rsquo;s Beta value at 1.0.</strong> You can achieve Beta 1.0 through leveraged funds in Roth accounts and cash or QQQ in Traditional/Brokerage accounts. This results in the same return but with a superior tax structure and risk control.</li>

<li>Share 1: After listening to the teacher&rsquo;s class, I decided to cancel a life insurance policy I had paid for 7 years, at CAD 20,000 per year. Although I lost CAD 100,000, I felt relieved. My husband also agreed because I calculated for him that even if we only got back a portion of this money, its value in 40 years would far exceed the CAD 1,000,000 insured amount. I don&rsquo;t regret my past decisions because they were made with the knowledge I had at the time, but now my understanding has upgraded.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Excellent sharing and decision. Having tens of millions in assets while alive is far more meaningful than receiving a million in insurance after death.</li>

<li>Question 1: I&rsquo;m 50 and plan to sell an investment property, expecting CAD 900,000 in cash. How should I allocate this large sum into my planned configuration of 40% QQQ, 15% QLD, 10% TQQQ, and 35% cash?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: For someone nearing retirement, safety is paramount. First, calculate how many years of living expenses you&rsquo;ll need after retirement and prepare <strong>at least 10-15 years of cash</strong>. For example, if you spend 60,000 a year, you&rsquo;ll need 600,000 in cash for 10 years. Set this money aside first, and then allocate the remaining funds according to your asset allocation ratio.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Short-term operations are feasible. But in the long run, if you and your children will eventually settle in the US, assets should ultimately be transferred to the US. This is primarily to simplify estate planning and avoid Taiwan&rsquo;s relatively high estate tax on large cash assets. The US estate tax exemption is much higher than Taiwan&rsquo;s. You need to be aware of the potential risks and penalties of not declaring overseas assets to the IRS and plan accordingly.</li>

<li>Question 1: I&rsquo;m new to the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy and plan to transfer all my funds. Should a large sum (e.g., $1 million) be invested all at once, or in batches?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>Immediately, right now, buy all at once</strong>. Investing in batches leads to poorer performance and is a tormenting process. You can adopt a 70/30 strategy, meaning 70% of the funds are bought immediately, and the remaining 30% is held as cash (invested in a money market fund). Don&rsquo;t be afraid of buying at a high point; looking back a few years from now, any current price will seem low.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>Absolutely not</strong>. This is an unnecessary complication that will only bring endless trouble, such as accounting, tax filing, company maintenance, etc. For long-term investors who don&rsquo;t sell, a personal Brokerage account is already very tax-optimized, so there&rsquo;s no need to complicate things for a little extra Roth space. The benefits are minimal, and the drawbacks are numerous.</li>

<li>Question 1: In the teacher&rsquo;s simulation, the final asset multiple of the 433 configuration without pledging (5.8x) was higher than that with pledging (4.somethingx). So why should we still choose stock-backed loans?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The simulation results depend on the historical market path. Our simulated period (starting from the 2000 high) was a &ldquo;volatile market&rdquo; with a sharp ten-year decline followed by a slow recovery. In such a market, &ldquo;mindless rebalancing&rdquo; (without pledging) performs better because it dares to buy heavily during downturns. However, in a long-term bull market (e.g., 1980-2000), &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; (with pledging) would outperform. The most important reason we choose pledging is not to pursue the highest return, but to <strong>ensure survival in extreme markets and avoid liquidation.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: When actually taking out a stock-backed loan, where does the monthly interest come from? Is it reserved from the $200,000 borrowed?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: No. The interest should also be borrowed. Your total loan limit is very high (e.g., $6 million on $10 million in assets), and you only borrowed $200,000. The monthly interest, a few hundred dollars, can be directly borrowed from your available credit limit. This way, your debt will increase slowly, but your assets will grow at a faster rate.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>You currently have 300 dollars, you should be able to spend 10,000 dollars.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight concisely explains the power of financial leverage. Your purchasing power should not be determined by your current cash, but by the potential future value of your assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hard work has no future&hellip; Making money work hard is what truly matters.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight overturns traditional values, emphasizing the importance of passive income and asset appreciation. The core is to make capital work for you, not the other way around.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re even vigilant when you receive a scam call, but you completely trust what your financial advisor tells you, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s truly terrifying.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight uses a strong contrast to warn investors that they must maintain independent judgment and critical thinking towards all financial institutions&rsquo; advice, not blindly trusting them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The financial industry, the insurance industry, and the government, combined, are a scam group.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight, in an extreme way, reminds investors to be highly wary of complex products recommended by all financial institutions, as their goal is usually to earn your fees and commissions, not to serve your best interests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Beta is the same, the volatility is the same, the return rate is the same.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight is the scientific core of asset allocation. The return of an investment portfolio is determined by its overall market risk exposure (Beta), not by how many &ldquo;magical&rdquo; leveraged products it contains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I actually didn&rsquo;t feel much pain, discomfort, or regret&hellip; because that was the decision I made based on my understanding at the time, but now I&rsquo;m different.
&ndash; Jenny</p></blockquote>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s reflection when sharing her decision to surrender a loss-making insurance policy embodies the process of an investor&rsquo;s mental maturation: not being trapped by past sunk costs, but bravely making the right decision based on a higher level of understanding now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not a truth you&rsquo;ve realized yourself, there&rsquo;s no extra profit in it for you, because it belongs to others.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasizes the importance of independent thinking and truly understanding investment philosophy. Following the crowd or using strategies one doesn&rsquo;t understand, even if profitable in the short term, cannot be sustained in the long run because it doesn&rsquo;t fall within one&rsquo;s own circle of competence.</p>

<p>This gathering was a profound course in reshaping financial intelligence. Teacher James fundamentally challenged the traditional notion of &ldquo;work hard, save money to get rich,&rdquo; clearly advocating a rich mindset centered on &ldquo;financial operations.&rdquo; Through the strategy of &ldquo;borrowing to consume, never selling assets,&rdquo; investors can break free from dependence on active income, allowing assets to calmly compound in the market over the long term. The Q&amp;A session served as a rich case study, applying this core concept to diverse real-world scenarios such as salary negotiations, insurance decisions, large-sum asset deployment, and cross-border asset management, providing listeners with extremely valuable practical guidance and mindset building. The entire sharing was not just about &ldquo;technique&rdquo; (how to invest), but more about &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; (how to think about wealth).</p>

      <title>00526 QQQ Can Make You One of the World&#39;s Top Billionaires; Investing in VT Will Only Make You Part of the Poor Class</title>
      <link>https://jomonylw.github.io/en/posts/1754804670291/</link>

      <description>This issue focuses on two main themes: First, there is a huge difference in the long-term returns of different index funds (such as QQQ versus SPY and VT). Choosing the wrong target can lead to slow wealth growth, akin to becoming poorer. Second, it emphasizes the critical importance of financial communication with spouses, parents, and family members on the path to wealth through investment. Consensus should be built through continuous and frank discussions to avoid family relationship breakdowns over money issues.</description>

<p>This session&rsquo;s core viewpoints from Teacher James revolve around two main areas:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Decisive Nature of Investment Choices</strong>: Not all index funds can make you rich. Through detailed data comparisons, the teacher reveals the huge long-term return gap between QQQ and other index funds like SPY and VT, emphasizing the decisive role of choosing the right investment target (like QQQ) for wealth accumulation.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Financial Communication</strong>: On the road to wealth through investment, maintaining family relationships (especially with spouses and parents) is crucial. The teacher advocates for building financial consensus and trust among family members through continuous, &ldquo;chatter-style&rdquo; communication, sharing responsibilities, and avoiding family conflicts sparked by wealth growth.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communication with a Spouse</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Constant Chatter&rdquo; Method</strong>: It&rsquo;s recommended to share investment ideas, operations, and progress with your spouse in the form of daily conversation. This isn&rsquo;t for them to fully understand, but to give them a sense of participation and the right to be informed, building synchronization and trust. For example, casually mention what you bought more of today, what class you attended, or any new ideas you have.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Responsibility</strong>: Communicating from the start to reach a consensus gives both partners a sense of ownership in the decisions. Whether there are profits or losses, you can face them together, avoiding one person bearing all the pressure and getting unappreciated for their efforts. The teacher uses his company management as an example: his subordinates know all the information he does, so responsibilities are shared, and the manager feels no pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Secrets, Honesty is Respect</strong>: There should be no financial secrets from your spouse. Say what&rsquo;s on your mind; this is a form of respect. Making decisions alone, regardless of success or failure, can pose a risk to the family relationship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Communication with Parents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Planning and Gentle Communication</strong>: When parents are approaching retirement age (50s-60s), you should begin discussing future financial and care arrangements. Use a caring tone and examples (like the sudden situations of neighbor Mrs. Chang or Uncle Li) to gradually &ldquo;brainwash&rdquo; them, rather than forcefully demanding management rights.</li>
<li><strong>The Role of Children</strong>: Children who have learned about finance should bravely take on the role of the family CFO (Chief Financial Officer), responsible for financial planning, investment management, and payment systems, while keeping clear accounts and reporting to the family regularly.</li>
<li><strong>Elder Care Trusts</strong>: If parents are not comfortable entrusting their money to a single child, or if the children cannot reach a consensus, consider setting up an &ldquo;Elder Care Trust.&rdquo; The bank would be responsible for management and payments, and some banks even allow specifying investment targets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Practice of Caring for Parents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevention is Better Than Cure</strong>: Care for your parents should start with daily life, paying attention to their &ldquo;eating, drinking, defecating, urinating, and sleeping.&rdquo; Take them for regular health check-ups (for the &ldquo;three highs&rdquo; - high blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar), monitor their vision (e.g., get injections for macular degeneration early, even if you have to pay out-of-pocket), hearing (e.g., get hearing aids from Costco early), knees, and other body &ldquo;parts,&rdquo; intervening at the first sign of a problem.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Sleep</strong>: Understand your parents&rsquo; sleep situation. If they don&rsquo;t sleep well, you can discuss solutions, such as trying Melatonin, and avoid sleeping pills with significant side effects.</li>
<li><strong>Health is the Children&rsquo;s Happiness</strong>: When parents are healthy and can take care of themselves, it is the greatest happiness for their children. Don&rsquo;t wait until they are bedridden to start managing; the family burden will be extremely heavy by then.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Astonishing Long-Term Performance Differences</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>40 years</strong>: QQQ had an annualized return of 14%, while SPY (S&amp;P 500) was only 8.95%—a huge gap.</li>
<li><strong>17 years</strong>: QQQ&rsquo;s annualized return was 15.8%, SPY/VOO/VTI was about 9.6%, while VT (Total World Stock) was a meager 5.7%.</li>
<li><strong>10 years</strong>: QQQ&rsquo;s annualized return was 18.17%, SPY was 11.8%, and VT was only 7.8%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Those who invest in QQQ might become &ldquo;billionaires,&rdquo; those in SPY are &ldquo;wealthy people,&rdquo; and those in VT might become &ldquo;poor people who think they are rich.&rdquo; If the direction is wrong, all effort is wasted.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Correction</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: What if I have already bought SPY, VOO, or VT, especially in the US where I have to pay taxes?</li>
<li><strong>Answer</strong>: You must sell! Pay for past mistakes, pay the tax once, but in return, you get much higher long-term returns in the future. Don&rsquo;t cling to the wrong assets for a lifetime just to save a little on taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Sunk Cost</strong>: It&rsquo;s like finding out the elevator is broken and switching to another one immediately, not stubbornly waiting in the broken one. It&rsquo;s also like realizing a relationship isn&rsquo;t working after five years; you can&rsquo;t continue down the wrong path just because you&rsquo;ve invested five years.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>From Money Anxiety to Magnanimity</strong>: Taking the sharing from student Michael as an example, he used to have anxiety about money because he was afraid of spending it. After getting rich through investing, his life got better and better, but more importantly, his mindset changed. He learned to use money with magnanimity for physical and mental health and family happiness. Letting go of money anxiety can improve relationships with family.</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;C&rdquo; Investment Philosophy</strong>: Aims to eliminate poverty and people&rsquo;s anxiety about money. We should not be slaves to capital, but capitalists. &ldquo;Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right.&rdquo; We should live a worthy life.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation Principles</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash is King</strong>: Keep at least 30% in cash. Cash is the &ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark&rdquo; of investing; it can save your life.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Leverage</strong>: For those who want to use leverage but are afraid of the risk, you can start with a lower Beta (e.g., 0.5-0.7) and gradually get used to it.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy for Young People</strong>: Even with little capital, you must first establish an emergency fund. For example, if you only have 200,000 TWD but your annual living expenses are 300,000 TWD, you cannot invest this 200,000. You should save up the emergency fund first, and then invest the rest.</li>

<li>Question: I am 27 this year. How should I prepare for my parents&rsquo; (around 60) future medical expenses? About how much money is needed?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Based on my mother&rsquo;s experience (she had 6 million TWD prepared when she started needing care at age 80), and considering inflation, one parent might need about 10 million TWD in 20 years. I suggest you start now, saving at least 10,000 TWD per month for your parents, and separately save for your own retirement. More importantly, start paying attention to your parents&rsquo; health now. Take them to the metabolism department for regular check-ups (like blood sugar, cholesterol) and address hearing and vision problems promptly. Prevention is better than cure.</li>

<li>Question: The retirement account at my current company (TIAA) does not offer QQQ, but my previous company&rsquo;s retirement account (Fidelity) does. What should I do?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: First, for the account from the job you&rsquo;ve already left, you can do a Rollover into an IRA account, which will allow you to freely invest in QQQ. For your current company&rsquo;s underperforming retirement account, I suggest you stop contributing to it. You should prioritize maxing out your Roth IRA, and put the rest of your money directly into your own Brokerage Account to buy QQQ.</li>

<li>Question: After my sister took the teacher&rsquo;s class, she canceled more than a dozen insurance policies, took out a personal loan, and invested heavily in 00662 (the Taiwanese QQQ equivalent). Our family thinks she&rsquo;s &ldquo;gone off the deep end.&rdquo; Many people around us still advocate for individual stocks. May I ask why the teacher himself switched from investing in individual stocks to exclusively recommending index funds?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I invested in individual stocks for over 30 years. Although my performance was good, after taxes, I didn&rsquo;t truly beat QQQ. More critically, individual stock trading requires real-time buy/sell instructions. For a community of tens of thousands of students like we have now, I cannot provide timely notifications, which would cause losses for everyone. Therefore, abandoning complex individual stock picking, which may not even yield better results in the end, and turning to simple, transparent index investing with excellent long-term returns is the most responsible and effective method for everyone.</li>

<li>Question: The teacher mentioned that wealth will become more concentrated in the future, &ldquo;the big get bigger.&rdquo; In that case, would an ETF like 00757 (FNGS), which is even more concentrated in tech giants, be better than 00662 (QQQ)?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I don&rsquo;t recommend it. The biggest problem with 00757 is its &ldquo;unpredictability.&rdquo; Its stock selection logic is not transparent (why these 10 stocks?), and its volatility is unknown, which makes it impossible for you to do scientific asset allocation. Its performance is not necessarily better than the predictable QLD (00670L, the 2x leveraged QQQ). The so-called &ldquo;mean reversion&rdquo; does not exist between assets of different natures (e.g., apples and oranges don&rsquo;t revert to each other). Instead of investing in a fund you don&rsquo;t understand, it&rsquo;s better to build your own &ldquo;top ten&rdquo; portfolio based on QQQ&rsquo;s holdings, which has a clearer logic.</li>

<li>Question: I use a sub-brokerage account in Taiwan to buy QQQ and then never sell. Is this okay? And if I have a large home equity line of credit, is it good to keep it as an emergency fund?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: No, that&rsquo;s not okay. The problems are: 1. <strong>Taxes</strong>: When your assets grow to tens of millions, you will eventually need the money, and as soon as you sell, you will face high capital gains taxes. 2. <strong>Opportunity Cost</strong>: Keeping your HELOC credit line as cash is a huge waste. You should borrow all the money you can and invest it in the market. Even just buying short-term bonds (like 00865B in Taiwan) for arbitrage is better than letting the money sleep in the bank. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of the debt figure; look at the growth potential of your assets. The market is always at a low point. You must act immediately, right now.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Investment hesitation is the biggest mistake.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: At the beginning of the session, the teacher emphasized that the market doesn&rsquo;t wait when it&rsquo;s rising. The hesitant mentality of not buying whether the market is up or down is the biggest mistake in investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t avoid doing the right thing just to save on taxes.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When answering a student&rsquo;s question about whether to sell SPY/VOO to switch to QQQ, the teacher stressed that even if it means paying taxes, one should decisively correct wrong investment decisions to focus on the correct long-term returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must do a smart rebalance every year with leveraged funds, or you will be wiped out overnight.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When explaining how to hold leveraged ETFs like TQQQ and QLD, the teacher repeatedly emphasized that these products must be managed with an annual &ldquo;smart rebalance&rdquo; to lock in profits and control risk; otherwise, long-term holding could lead to returns diminishing to zero.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;ve read so many books, now put them to use!
&ndash; Teacher James (quoting a general manager)</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When discussing how to learn from history and philosophy, the teacher emphasized that the ultimate purpose of knowledge is practice. If you read the classics, you must think about how to apply them in your life; otherwise, no amount of knowledge is more than just garbage in your head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The market is always at a low point.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When encouraging students to overcome their fear of heights and invest immediately, the teacher pointed out that relative to the future price (e.g., QQQ potentially reaching 50,000 points), any current price should be considered a low point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Explaining the philosophy of C-position investment and financial education, the core of which is to help people break free from money anxiety and live a happy, fulfilling life where they realize their self-worth, rather than being slaves to money.</p>

<p>This session once again reinforced the core strategies and philosophy of C-position investment and financial management. In terms of investment strategy, it irrefutably demonstrated the superiority of QQQ as a core asset through detailed data comparisons, urging students to have the courage to correct past investment mistakes, even if it incurs some tax costs. On the philosophy of life and family relations, the teacher profoundly pointed out that wealth growth must go hand-in-hand with family harmony. The key to achieving this is continuous, honest financial communication built on a foundation of trust. Whether it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;constant chatter&rdquo; sharing between spouses or the patient guidance for parents, the goal is to build a family financial system based on consensus and shared responsibility. Ultimately, the course guides us back to the origin of investing: to use capital as a tool to achieve a happy and meaningful life, free from anxiety about money.</p>

      <description>In this session, James focuses on how to leverage real estate for financing, specifically discussing &amp;#39;reverse mortgages&amp;#39; for retirees and &amp;#39;investment-type home equity loans&amp;#39; for general homeowners. He details the pros and cons, suitable candidates, and operational key points for both tools, and shares practical tips for preventing real estate fraud. Additionally, the course emphasizes the immense impact of choosing the right investment vehicle (QQQ vs. SPY/VT) on future wealth, reiterates the core investment strategies of holding cash, smart rebalancing, and utilizing pledged loans, and answers various specific questions including obtaining loans with overseas income, handling mortgages after retirement, and balancing career and family.</description>

<p>The core theme of this session is <strong>how to unlock the value of real estate through financial instruments, converting fixed assets into liquid capital for investment, thereby achieving exponential wealth growth</strong>. The instructor details two methods, &ldquo;reverse mortgages&rdquo; and &ldquo;investment-type home equity loans,&rdquo; and emphasizes that in Taiwan&rsquo;s low-interest-rate environment, borrowing to invest is a powerful lever for ordinary people to accumulate wealth. At the same time, the course reiterates that future wealth gaps will be primarily determined by the choice of investment vehicles, with those investing in high-tech indexes (like the Nasdaq-100) pulling far ahead of those investing in traditional broad market indexes.</p>

<li><strong>Background</strong>: A friend working in bank lending suggested that the instructor share the concept of &ldquo;reverse mortgages,&rdquo; which is an excellent option for many retirees who have insufficient funds but own a mortgage-free home.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of &ldquo;Investment-Type Home Equity Loans&rdquo;</strong>: For retirees without a stable source of income, applying for an &ldquo;investment-type home equity loan&rdquo; is highly risky.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Suppose you borrow TWD 10 million at a 2.4% annual interest rate, requiring TWD 240,000 in annual interest payments. However, according to our investment principles, you can only safely withdraw 2% of this TWD 10 million asset annually (which is TWD 200,000). Since the interest expense exceeds the usable amount, it results in negative cash flow, which is very risky.</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: Individuals who are retired, have no income, are unable to qualify for an investment-type home equity loan, but own a mortgage-free property and have insufficient investment capital to support their retirement.</li>
<li><strong>Core Benefit</strong>: Through a reverse mortgage, you can receive a stable monthly cash flow for living expenses, while your original investment principal of several million or ten million TWD can remain untouched to continue compounding in the market. This is equivalent to &ldquo;borrowing money to live, while letting your own assets continue to grow.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Information from Taiwanese Banks</strong>: The instructor provided information from institutions like Bank of Taiwan for &ldquo;reverse mortgages,&rdquo; with interest rates around 2.2% to 2.6% and loan terms typically up to 30 years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conditions for Investment-Type Home Equity Loans</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Rate</strong>: The current rate for a general investment-type home equity loan is about 2.59%.</li>
<li><strong>Restrictions</strong>: There are requirements on the age of the property and the loan term (e.g., building age + loan term &lt; 60). This could limit young people who buy older, second-hand homes from accessing this service in the future.</li>

<li><strong>Background</strong>: There have been many recent cases in the country where seniors&rsquo; properties were scammed. Fraud groups often target properties that do not have a mortgage lien.</li>
<li><strong>Preventive Measures</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Do Not Cancel the Mortgage Lien</strong>: Even if the mortgage is fully paid off, it is recommended not to go to the land administration office to cancel the bank&rsquo;s mortgage lien. Keeping this registered lien adds a layer of security.</li>
<li><strong>Apply for Two Services</strong>: Children can take their parents to the household registration office to apply for &ldquo;<strong>Advance Notice Registration</strong>&rdquo; (to prevent the property from being arbitrarily transferred or sold) and the &ldquo;<strong>Real-time Land Registry Alert</strong>&rdquo; service (which sends an immediate notification if there are any changes to the property&rsquo;s land registry data).</li>

<li><strong>Instructor&rsquo;s View</strong>: High living costs are a common phenomenon in the United States.

<li><strong>Future Wealth Will Be More Concentrated</strong>: Artificial intelligence and digital finance will accelerate the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few companies and individuals. In the future, it could be that 0.1% of the population controls 80% of the wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Choosing the Right Vehicle is Crucial</strong>: Between investing and not investing, your assets will differ by two zeros. For those who invest in indexes, the assets of those who choose the wrong indexes (like VT, VOO, SPY) versus the right one (QQQ) will also differ by two zeros in the future. People investing in high-dividend stocks or SPY may become relatively poor in the future.</li>
<li><strong>The Purpose of Asset Allocation</strong>: The quality of an asset allocation and rebalancing strategy is not determined by the strategy itself, but by <strong>future market conditions</strong>. Since we cannot predict the future, the primary purpose of asset allocation is to <strong>give you peace of mind, enabling you to endure the worst market periods (like a continuous ten-year decline)</strong>, rather than pursuing the highest short-term performance.</li>
<li><strong>On Educating Children</strong>: When facing a child&rsquo;s problem, analyze whether it&rsquo;s a lack of &ldquo;ability&rdquo; or a lack of &ldquo;willingness.&rdquo; A lack of ability requires &ldquo;teaching,&rdquo; while a lack of willingness requires &ldquo;encouragement.&rdquo; Plant good seeds and nurture them with love, companionship, and positive energy.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Seniors in Taiwan are in a pitiful situation now because landlords, fearing that an elderly person might pass away in the property and turn it into a &ldquo;stigmatized property&rdquo; affecting its value, are unwilling to rent to them.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This is actually an excuse by landlords; legally, a natural death does not constitute a stigmatized property. The fundamental problem is poverty. If you become wealthy, you won&rsquo;t have housing problems. The lack of investment and financial literacy education in Taiwan makes it difficult for many people to accumulate wealth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: I bought 00662 at a high point of 93 earlier this year. Even though the US QQQ has reached a new high, my 00662 has not yet broken even because the Taiwan dollar has appreciated. I feel anxious. Should I use a sub-brokerage account to buy the US stock QQQ directly?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: This is a normal phenomenon caused by exchange rates. If you convert the price of QQQ at its peak back then using the higher exchange rate at the time (e.g., 33), you would find that its value in TWD also hasn&rsquo;t reached a new high. It&rsquo;s essentially the same, so there&rsquo;s no need to worry about exchange rates. If you&rsquo;re in Taiwan, just buy 00662 with TWD. Buy whenever you have money, and don&rsquo;t worry about exchange rates or short-term market fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: I have a USD-denominated insurance policy with a 3.5% annualized return that I want to cancel, but I&rsquo;m worried about the unfavorable exchange rate for converting it back to TWD now. This money is for my child. Should I allocate it as 50% 00662 and 50% 00670L (a leveraged ETF)?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: A 3.5% return is too low; you should cancel it decisively. Don&rsquo;t worry about the short-term exchange rate, because after you convert to TWD and buy 00662, the nature of the asset reverts to a USD asset. For a 30-year investment for your child, the simplest and safest way is to buy 100% 00662 and hold it for the long term. If you must include leverage, you can, but you must understand its risks and rebalance properly. Otherwise, simply holding 00662 is better.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He has been following the instructor for nearly two years, and his assets have doubled. He uses a 4-3-3 allocation, holding 30% in cash (about 10 years of living expenses), which makes him completely indifferent to market ups and downs and gives him great peace of mind. He also shared a real-life case of his 72-year-old elder who applied for a &ldquo;reverse mortgage&rdquo;: for a TWD 7 million house, they can receive TWD 17,000 per month for 23 years. He believes this allows the elder to age with dignity and also frees up the children&rsquo;s funds. The filial piety money saved by the children can be invested to create even greater wealth.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This is an excellent sharing. This is the essence of a &ldquo;reverse mortgage.&rdquo; If the children invest the saved TWD 17,000 per month, at a 12% annualized rate of return, it will grow to over TWD 52 million in 30 years. This is equivalent to using a TWD 7 million loan from the bank to create tens of millions in additional wealth—a very smart financial move.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Fubon Bank has a 20-year revolving investment-type home equity loan product. She thinks it&rsquo;s better for young people than a reverse mortgage and suggests everyone look into it.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: There is no capital gains tax in Taiwan. In retirement, will it still be necessary to live off funds from a stock-pledged loan? Can I just sell the bond portion of my asset allocation for expenses?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: You don&rsquo;t have to use a pledged loan, but your wealth will grow much slower. He gives an example: with TWD 50 million in assets, if you sell 2% each year to live on (assuming a 10% rate of return), it will grow to TWD 2.2 billion in 40 years. If you live off a pledged loan and leave the principal untouched (assuming a 12% rate of return), it will grow to TWD 4.6 billion in 40 years—more than double the amount. The risk of pledging is controllable, but the return is enormous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: If I want to withdraw 3% annually, but my total assets are not yet large, should I switch to the less volatile SPY?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: No need. You can achieve this by adjusting the Beta of your asset allocation, for example, by using a 70-30 or 4-2-4 allocation while still holding QQQ, and you can still safely withdraw 3%.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: She discovered that an older colleague&rsquo;s retirement account balance was only one-third of hers. The reason was that the colleague chose a very conservative investment model, which fell less but also grew much less. This made her deeply realize the importance of choosing the right investment vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: She was most shocked to learn about the Pledge Asset Line (PAL) from the instructor and immediately opened one. She believes people should not be afraid of PAL. Compared to taking on a huge mortgage with a small down payment, PAL is a small loan based on a substantial asset foundation, making it much less risky. She compares PAL to a &ldquo;future employer&rdquo;—whenever you need money, you just go and get it. It&rsquo;s very convenient.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: An excellent sharing. This is the core of financial operations. In Taiwan, with such low interest rates, anyone with property must get an investment-type home equity loan or a reverse mortgage. Not borrowing this cheap money is a huge waste. You can only become truly wealthy if you know how to borrow money safely.</li>

<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Emotional matters cannot be measured in money. But from a financial perspective, you should deal with it as soon as possible. He suggests she first go and set up the reverse mortgage.

<li><strong>Question</strong>: He just secured a TWD 7.5 million investment-type home equity loan and invested TWD 6 million in 00662. He wants to keep his monthly interest payment around TWD 10,000 and is struggling with a decision: should he use the entire TWD 6 million as his investment base for a 7-3 allocation, or use only TWD 4 million for the allocation and leave the remaining TWD 2 million untouched in the loan account to reduce interest?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: All loan interest should be paid from your salary. The invested TWD 6 million should be managed as a single portfolio. Given that he is still young, he should adopt a more aggressive allocation, such as 5-2-3 or 4-3-3. The cash portion of the allocation (e.g., 30%, which is TWD 1.8 million) should be invested in a high-yield money market fund (like 00865B, with an annualized return of about 4.5%), not left in the non-interest-bearing loan account.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: When rebalancing, if the market drops and I need to add to my leveraged ETF position, should the cash come from the cash position within my brokerage account or be transferred from an external bank account?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: The cash comes from the cash portion of your entire investment portfolio. Ideally, the leveraged fund is in a tax-advantaged account (like an IRA), and the cash for re-buying should also come from the cash position within that same account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: I can start accessing my 401K next year and plan to roll it into an IRA. At that time, living expenses and taxes might strain my cash flow. Should I use a PAL to cover these? What if a major market crash exhausts my PAL limit?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: This is why you keep 30% cash. If a market crash occurs and your brokerage account (where the PAL is) faces a margin call, you should transfer cash (e.g., by selling SWVXX) from your tax-advantaged account like an IRA to the brokerage account as collateral, not transfer stocks. SWVXX has a very high pledge rate (96%), which can effectively boost your collateral value and borrowing capacity.

&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view challenges the traditional &ldquo;debt-free is worry-free&rdquo; concept, emphasizing that in a low-interest-rate environment, learning to use leverage safely and intelligently by borrowing to invest is a crucial habit for accelerating wealth accumulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was born in Taiwan, and if I don&rsquo;t own 0050, it feels like I&rsquo;m not participating. I&rsquo;m just very conflicted internally.
&ndash; Student Lana</p></blockquote>
<p>This sentence genuinely reflects the &ldquo;home bias&rdquo; and emotional factors that influence many investors&rsquo; decisions, serving as a very typical and relatable &ldquo;mental block.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This session reinforces the core investment philosophy of CLEC while introducing more specific wealth-growth strategies. Through the cases of &ldquo;reverse mortgages&rdquo; and &ldquo;investment-type home equity loans,&rdquo; the instructor vividly demonstrated how to unlock seemingly &ldquo;dormant&rdquo; real estate and turn it into fuel for wealth growth. The course not only provided operational guidance but, more importantly, continued to shape the investor&rsquo;s mindset: to break the fear of debt and understand the power of leverage; to abandon focus on short-term fluctuations and concentrate on choosing the right long-term track; and to recognize that the essence of wealth is cognition. Only by continuously improving financial literacy can one stand invincible in the future tide of wealth.</p>

<p>The core of this lecture is to emphasize <strong>persisting in long-term investment in the Nasdaq 100 index fund, prioritizing risk control and reasonable asset allocation, and maintaining an extremely optimistic investment mindset</strong>. Teacher James points out that market volatility is normal; investors should ignore short-term fluctuations, focus on long-term growth, recognize the critical role of cash in asset allocation, and ultimately achieve financial freedom and life&rsquo;s purpose.</p>

<li><strong>The Market&rsquo;s Normal State</strong>: Global situations and market turmoil are normal. Investors should remain calm and not be disturbed by short-term volatility, international affairs, market analysis, financial statements, or economic conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This channel is a pro bono sharing platform and does not constitute investment advice. There are no fees, no alternate accounts, and be wary of scams.

<li><strong>Learning Path</strong>: Newcomers are advised to start with &ldquo;00451 The One-Dollar Investment Lecture,&rdquo; think independently, and find a method that suits them. Quiet study improves the quality of thought more than joining too many groups.</li>
<li><strong>Core Investment Vehicle</strong>: Focus on the Nasdaq 100 index fund (like QQQ). Page 10 of the handout provides a selection of related funds worldwide. The videos started in 2018, and there is a complete 2022 course playlist available.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Mentality</strong>: Always be extremely optimistic, always face the sun; the market will eventually go up. Investing requires patience (ignoring market fluctuations), and financial freedom is worth the wait. Please like, comment, and subscribe on all platforms.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stablecoins and Short-Term Treasuries</strong>: A student asked if the issuance of stablecoins would increase demand for short-term treasuries and lower their interest rates. Teacher James believes short-term treasury rates are tied to the central bank&rsquo;s rates and won&rsquo;t fall significantly because of this. Short-term treasuries are similar to money market funds with low volatility. The central bank&rsquo;s rate is the benchmark; no one would buy a bond with a lower rate.</li>
<li><strong>The Trap of Long-Term Bonds</strong>: Long-term bond interest is linked to inflation expectations for many years to come, and the interest is fixed.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: For a 30-year Treasury bond with a 5% coupon rate, if inflation is 3%, the real annualized rate of return (Real IRR) is only 1.94%. In contrast, if short-term rates are 4%, it is far superior to the real return of long-term bonds. The $5 in interest you receive after 30 years will have long been devalued.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: It is not recommended for individual investors to buy long-term government bonds. Issuing long-term bonds is advantageous for the U.S. Treasury because the long-term interest is close to zero for the issuer (after considering inflation). Even if the central bank&rsquo;s rate is below 2%, buying long-term bonds is not necessarily a good deal. The Treasury has its own issuance plan and won&rsquo;t easily change it due to shifts in the central bank&rsquo;s rates. The idea of issuing 100-year bonds is impractical and tantamount to default.</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Awareness</strong>: The first priority in investing is risk control; the world is full of uncertainties (like the conflict in Israel).</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Asset Allocation</strong>: Good asset allocation is a &ldquo;master strategy&rdquo; (奇门遁甲), a powerful &ldquo;Army, Navy, and Air Force&rdquo; deployment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash</strong>: The &ldquo;food and air&rdquo; of asset allocation, the most important part. Sufficient cash prevents market panic.</li>
<li><strong>Index Fund</strong>: The &ldquo;aircraft carrier&rdquo; of asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraged Fund</strong>: Like the &ldquo;missile force.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging</strong>: The &ldquo;Transformer&rdquo; of asset allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Courage to Sell a House for Investment</strong>: Selling your primary residence to rent and investing the funds in an index is an excellent financial strategy, but it requires a strong mind and the courage to face social judgment (e.g., fear of being told you&rsquo;re &ldquo;not doing well&rdquo;). In reality, this is a sign of &ldquo;doing exceptionally well.&rdquo;</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Difficulty of Educating Family and Friends</strong>: Family and friends would rather trust the annuities and savings insurance (1% return) recommended by bank advisors than accept advice about index funds (10% long-term return), even when presented with spreadsheets. The main reason is the fear of &ldquo;what if it drops?&rdquo;
<ul>
<li><strong>Counter-strategy</strong>: First, become a &ldquo;big tree&rdquo; yourself and influence them with your own success. Your words carry little weight when you&rsquo;re insignificant; &ldquo;familiarity breeds contempt&rdquo; (近庙欺神). It&rsquo;s hard to distinguish &ldquo;saints&rdquo; from &ldquo;demons&rdquo; in society.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive Roots of the Wealth Gap</strong>: Poverty is often caused by a lack of awareness, not systemic issues. CLEC aims to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; this &ldquo;disease of poverty,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s very difficult; even family members may not accept it. Some people can&rsquo;t accept good medicine and instead buy things like long-term bonds.</li>
<li><strong>The Challenges of Individual Stock Investing</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: NVIDIA&rsquo;s stock price fluctuates wildly. It was once sold off due to poor sales and excess inventory, then soared because of AI. It&rsquo;s difficult for individual investors to grasp; even if you bought it, you might not have held on for the entire ride.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Individual stocks are volatile, information is asymmetric, and they can suddenly be cut in half or go to zero. ETFs provide a more stable way to share in market growth. It&rsquo;s also very hard to stick with a portfolio of mixed-quality individual stocks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Dangers of Short-Term Trading</strong>: Short-term trading is like &ldquo;gambling + drug addiction.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s addictive and leads not only to financial loss but also the loss of family, health, and self, potentially ruining one&rsquo;s entire life. There&rsquo;s no need to become a &ldquo;boy wonder trader.&rdquo;</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profit Motives of Banks and Insurance Companies</strong>: Criticizes post offices and banks for persuading depositors (especially the elderly) to buy annuity insurance, structured notes, and similar products. This is a failure of financial regulators.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Issues</strong>: Believes financial regulators should ensure the separation of savings, insurance, wealth management, and lending to avoid conflicts of interest. American commercial banks (like BofA) don&rsquo;t proactively sell insurance. Taiwan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Financial Holding Company&rdquo; model is described as an &ldquo;all-encompassing, one-stop-shop scam.&rdquo; Charles Schwab only mentions loan options when a client has a large funding need.</li>
<li><strong>The Goal of the Insurance Industry</strong>: To convert large amounts of fixed deposits into insurance policies, which is the main objective of the insurance industry, given the huge amount of fixed deposits in Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>The Risk of Mortgaging Property to Buy Insurance</strong>: There have been cases where the property mortgage remains, but the insurance policy&rsquo;s value drops to zero, leaving people homeless. These institutions &ldquo;will go as far as making people homeless.&rdquo;</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>On Publishing a Book/Media Exposure</strong>: Teacher James frankly states that if he were to publicly promote his ideas like &ldquo;investing with loans&rdquo; and &ldquo;not buying a house,&rdquo; he could violate financial regulations (practicing without a license), offend powerful interest groups (real estate, insurance, finance), and even face cyberbullying and political pressure (being labeled &ldquo;pro-Taiwan independence&rdquo; or &ldquo;pro-CCP&rdquo;). He could be &ldquo;torn to shreds&rdquo; or even &ldquo;end up in jail.&rdquo; If he doesn&rsquo;t discuss many of these topics, the teaching loses its meaning. The very people you help might turn around and curse you.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance</strong>: An insurance policy with a 1.06% annual return is acceptable if it includes protection, but it&rsquo;s generally not recommended.</li>
<li><strong>Caring for Parents</strong>: Re-emphasizes the loneliness and health risks of elderly people living alone (not taking medicine on time, not measuring blood sugar/pressure, leading to complications like worsening COPD, minor strokes, brain atrophy, mental disorders). Advises children to pay attention and provide companionship early. Even if parents seem self-sufficient, consider arranging for a caregiver early to prevent accidents and ensure a regular routine (medication, diet, avoiding falls). Shares his regret of not returning to Taiwan in time to accompany his mother, who, despite having other children in Taiwan, was not adequately cared for while living alone. Emphasizes that parents&rsquo; health is the children&rsquo;s happiness.</li>
<li><strong>A Partner&rsquo;s Investment Philosophy</strong>: Accept individual differences. Due to different upbringings and personal experiences (like living through the dot-com and 2008 bubbles), security levels and cognitions vary. Lead by example and influence them gradually with long-term results; don&rsquo;t force it. It&rsquo;s normal for them not to listen to you, just as you may not listen to them.</li>
<li><strong>00662 (Taiwan ETF) Currency Impact</strong>: Short-term currency fluctuations are normal. For instance, when the Taiwan dollar depreciated in the previous two years, 00662 outperformed QQQ. In the long run, currency effects tend to cancel each other out.</li>
<li><strong>Credit Loans vs. Stock Pledges</strong>: Credit loans are relatively independent and safe. Stock pledges are high-risk; a sharp market downturn could trigger a margin call, making it like a &ldquo;loan shark&rdquo; — you have to pay back when they demand it, or you&rsquo;re &ldquo;shot dead with one bullet.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Brokerage Firms Raising Pledge Rates and Risks</strong>: Brokerages like Capital Securities in Taiwan might raise interest rates after a client has borrowed, or even restrict withdrawals (due to limited funding pools), &ldquo;luring you into a trap.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s advisable to prioritize more stable brokerages like Yuanta Securities.</li>
<li><strong>Apply for Credit Loans Early</strong>: Bank credit policies can change. When you qualify (e.g., with an interest rate below 2%), you should apply early. Seize the opportunity when a bank proactively offers you a loan.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging in Hong Kong</strong>: HSBC is a good choice, especially for VIP clients with large capital (e.g., over 1 million HKD). HSBC&rsquo;s pledge interest rates are currently low. Friends from Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, etc., who successfully open an account and get a pledge loan from HSBC are welcome to share their experiences.</li>
<li><strong>QQQ Compounding</strong>: The annualized rate of return (CAGR), according to Teacher James&rsquo;s research, is around 18% (including dividend reinvestment).</li>
<li><strong>Repayment of Investment Mortgage</strong>: Typically, it&rsquo;s a lump-sum repayment at maturity (10-15 years). By then, you can sell some stocks or use another pledged loan to repay it. You need more than 15 years to ensure profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Compound Frequency</strong>: Refers to capital gains and dividend reinvestment.</li>
<li><strong>Philosophy of Helping Others</strong>: There are different levels of helping others. The lowest is for others (hoping for their well-being). The next is for oneself (deriving happiness or meaning from it). The highest is selflessness (helping is a natural act, regardless of for whom, or whether it brings happiness, like the Buddha or Jesus; it&rsquo;s natural ethics). Using helping others to add meaning and happiness to one&rsquo;s own life is actually &ldquo;not right.&rdquo; The highest state is &ldquo;like water flowing without a trace&rdquo; (传过水无痕).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: An elderly friend, who was once very influential in the market, agrees with Teacher James&rsquo;s index investing philosophy. This elder confessed that his past outsized returns were due to information asymmetry and his influence (manipulating small-cap stocks), which is not replicable for ordinary investors. He believes it&rsquo;s not easy for ordinary people to make money in the market, and index investing is the most correct path.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Index investing not only makes you money but also gives you a &ldquo;life&rdquo; (improves quality of life). Even if you make money from short-term trading, you might lose your life due to constant anxiety (e.g., being unable to take a 15-day vacation with peace of mind).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sharing (Follow-up)</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Reflecting on her family life, she emphasizes love and companionship for her parents to avoid regrets. She sees Teacher James&rsquo;s actions as &ldquo;dedication&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;charity&rdquo; with a sense of superiority and feels for the misunderstandings he might face.</li>
<li>Shares her future plans: to establish a women&rsquo;s financial academy (focusing on female financial awareness, as Chinese women are relatively disadvantaged, and financial independence provides more confidence), volunteer in hospice care (to learn about &ldquo;fasting until death&rdquo; and euthanasia), travel, read, and set up scholarships, reflecting a desire for &ldquo;altruism&rdquo; (influenced by Kazuo Inamori&rsquo;s philosophy of &ldquo;altruism&rdquo;).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Commends Kacy&rsquo;s practice of accompanying her parents. Shares the joy of his own father, in his 90s, still planning a trip to Korea. Advises that for elderly parents, even if they appear healthy, one should consider arranging for a caregiver early to prevent accidents and ensure a regular routine (medication, diet). Parents&rsquo; health is the children&rsquo;s happiness. If parents have medical needs, like follow-up visits every three months or low-dose lung cancer screenings, they should be supported.</li>
<li>Greatly admires Kacy&rsquo;s &ldquo;altruistic&rdquo; plans, believing that from a women&rsquo;s financial academy to educating disadvantaged groups, it&rsquo;s all very meaningful. It&rsquo;s right to start planning now.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: His mother noticed his mood has become calmer and happier recently. He explained it&rsquo;s because through investing (practicing the teacher&rsquo;s teachings), he has found meaning in life and is confident about his future wealth, no longer worrying about finances. This has led to an internal change from external influences.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Shares his own longing and regrets regarding his mother, how in his youth he failed to fully grasp the loneliness and hardship of an elderly person living alone (e.g., his mother falling while going to the doctor alone, and his own failure to return to Taiwan to be with her). Reminds everyone to care for their parents, especially those living alone, after achieving financial freedom early, to avoid life&rsquo;s regrets. Advises young people to learn from wise elders (like Warren Buffett) to avoid many pitfalls and find a &ldquo;mental coach.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Following the teacher&rsquo;s guidance, he used an investment mortgage to invest in 00662. After using a portion of the funds from high-dividend ETFs to pay the monthly interest, there&rsquo;s still a surplus each month. Should he invest this in 00865 (short-term bond/cash-like ETF) or continue buying fractional shares of 00662?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Continue buying 00662. The emergency fund (00865) only needs to be built up to a certain level (e.g., 2-3 years of living expenses for someone employed). Any excess funds should be invested in growth assets.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: Recalls entering the market in 2018, with emotions fluctuating with the market, having once lost 50%. A wise friend enlightened her (&ldquo;Save money when you&rsquo;re making it, and just wait it out when it&rsquo;s down&rdquo;), teaching her to remain calm through ups and downs and become numb to the market. Mentions how wealthy people view money (a piece of clothing costs 500-600k; money is like trash to them). Grateful for the teacher&rsquo;s guidance that has &ldquo;filled her head.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: Has come to understand the teacher&rsquo;s mindset that &ldquo;all sharing is for self-fulfillment, not for rewards.&rdquo; When sharing investment ideas with others, she encounters different reactions: some (who have worked for 20-30 years and are set in their ways) cling to old concepts, while others, despite living in hardship (a single mother working two jobs), are willing to listen. Through sharing, she has also gained a sense of value by giving back the knowledge she has learned.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: (Regarding Sharing 2) Helping others can bring happiness, but the highest state is to be &ldquo;unaffected by helping,&rdquo; meaning helping others is a natural act, not for happiness, not for self. The lowest level is &ldquo;for others,&rdquo; i.e., for their benefit; the second level is &ldquo;for oneself,&rdquo; i.e., achieving self-actualization through helping (the teacher admits his own teaching is to find value in retirement); the highest is &ldquo;selflessness,&rdquo; where even the thought of &ldquo;for myself&rdquo; is gone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: After sharing investment concepts with friends, how can she determine if they truly understand? Are there any questions to ask to test them? (Friends listen and think it&rsquo;s logical but can&rsquo;t articulate it themselves.)
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: It&rsquo;s hard to judge with simple questions. True understanding is reflected in action (like opening an account to invest). A more effective way is like how Frank guided him back in the day (meeting for dinner every week, hand-holding him through opening an account, starting with a $200 Mutual Fund), guiding them step-by-step to open an account, make their first investment, and follow up continuously. This is a process of &ldquo;sowing seeds&rdquo;; whether and when they sprout is unknown. He himself was &ldquo;led by the hand&rdquo; by Frank to get started. Now, he is willing to be such a guide, with the Bodhisattva spirit of &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t descend into hell, who will?&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Gained insights from gardening.
<ol>
<li><strong>Individual Differences</strong>: The same seeds planted result in different flowers, just as people receive information differently. Their internal &ldquo;genes&rdquo; determine their level of acceptance and reaction (some &ldquo;get it,&rdquo; others &ldquo;laugh it off&rdquo;). The gardener (the sharer) cannot change the seed&rsquo;s nature.</li>
<li><strong>Patient Guidance</strong>: A good gardener will loosen the soil and water, helping it grow, just as a mentor guides students to open accounts and invest.</li>
<li><strong>Inner Joy</strong>: The pleasure derived from tilling the soil and weeding surpasses the rewards of all fame and fortune. This effort is not for a return but for self-actualization.</li>
<li><strong>Practical Example</strong>: She once guided a friend to buy QQQ. The friend sold during a dip and missed the subsequent 45% gain. She only sent a screenshot and said no more, believing it was also &ldquo;fate.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Translating for the Elderly at a Doctor&rsquo;s Visit</strong>: Shares her experience as a volunteer translator for the elderly, realizing their immense need in medical communication. Such small acts can bring great help and a ray of light into their lives.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Agrees with the views on &ldquo;destiny&rdquo; and intrinsic motivation. Shares his own experience of planting tomatoes, where three seeds grew very differently; one was a &ldquo;chosen seedling&rdquo; and very robust, while others were &ldquo;sickly.&rdquo; Cites Dr. Yang Ding-I&rsquo;s view to &ldquo;look inward.&rdquo; For people you can&rsquo;t change, don&rsquo;t force it. Be yourself, don&rsquo;t be discouraged by it; giving up is an option. Affirms the value of her volunteer work.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Came into contact with CLEC in 2024 through a friend (who had mentioned it 5 years ago, but she was indifferent at the time). In her 50s, she has been interested in investing since graduating from college and has been exploring on her own for years. She was deeply moved after listening to the lectures and has invested a lot of time in studying (finished the 2021-2022 courses and is now re-listening). She shared it with a hundred people, and only two took action, but she still feels gratified.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Regarding the choice between a credit loan and a stock pledge in Taiwan. She leans towards using the stock pledge first (2.56% interest, no principal repayment, only interest), because of its convenience. She thinks she can use a credit loan (already approved for a 3 million TWD limit, but requires installment repayments) as a backup if the stock market crashes. She believes her job is stable (banks are always begging her to take out loans), so she&rsquo;s not afraid of unemployment and can access the credit loan anytime.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: (In a firm tone, repeatedly emphasizing) <strong>Absolutely do not do this!</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: Money borrowed from a stock pledge <strong>must not be reinvested in the stock market</strong>. It can only be used for living expenses or to repay other loans. This is &ldquo;the first thing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Huge Risk</strong>: When the market crashes, banks may tighten credit (&ldquo;take away the umbrella in the rain&rdquo;), and you might not be able to borrow money then. If you lose your job at the same time, it&rsquo;s even more impossible. A credit loan is not something you can just &ldquo;hold there&rdquo; forever.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy All Troops (韩信点兵)</strong>: All available &ldquo;forces&rdquo; (including the credit loan) should be deployed to the &ldquo;battlefield&rdquo; (investment) as early as possible.</li>
<li><strong>The Correct Approach</strong>: You should first take out the credit loan (e.g., 3 million TWD) and invest it in the market. The monthly loan repayments can be paid using funds from a low-interest stock pledge. This way, the principal continues to work in the market, and your personal salary can also be invested. Don&rsquo;t take a huge risk just because you&rsquo;re &ldquo;too lazy to repay the principal&rdquo; or tempted by the short-term convenience of a pledge.</li>
<li><strong>Safety of Credit Loans</strong>: A credit loan is a relatively safe form of leverage, not directly linked to market fluctuations, and you won&rsquo;t get a margin call. With a stock pledge, even if you only borrow 10% (e.g., pledging 1 million from a 10 million asset portfolio—the teacher thinks 10% is already a huge risk, let alone the 2-3 million she wants to borrow), you could face risks in an extreme market downturn.</li>
<li><strong>Brokerage Risk</strong>: Some brokerages in Taiwan (like Capital Securities) may change their pledge interest rates, and their limited funding pools might prevent you from withdrawing funds as needed.
(Kacy and other students also chimed in, emphasizing the risk of banks &ldquo;taking away the umbrella in the rain&rdquo; and the fundamental difference between credit loans and pledges, and that pledged money cannot be used to buy more stocks).</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Market fluctuations have nothing to do with me, international affairs have nothing to do with me, market analysis has nothing to do with me, financial statements have nothing to do with us, and the economic situation doesn&rsquo;t matter at all. Don&rsquo;t pay attention to it. The more you pay attention, the more mistakes you&rsquo;ll make.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Teacher James emphasized at the beginning the composure investors should have, not letting external noise affect their investment decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investing requires patience, and financial freedom is worth the wait. What is patience? It is to be unconcerned with market fluctuations.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>

<p>Cash is the food and air of asset allocation.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>

<p>You are poor because of a lack of awareness, not because the system made you poor.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>

<p>When you are making money, you should also be humble and look at everything with humility. Just as Teacher James taught me, whether the market goes up or down, OK, be numb to it. It doesn&rsquo;t have a big impact on our daily lives.
&ndash; IM</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student IM sharing her transformation from anxiously watching the market to maintaining a calm composure towards market fluctuations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The things we invest in others, when we invest, it&rsquo;s not for a return. It&rsquo;s because you have to do this thing. You have to do what is meaningful to you; this is the value of your being.
&ndash; Man</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Man drawing an analogy from gardening to the intrinsic value of sharing knowledge and helping others, without seeking external rewards.</p>

<p>In this session, Teacher James systematically re-emphasized his core investment philosophy: consistently buy and hold the Nasdaq 100 index fund, fearless of short-term market volatility. He focused on analyzing the extreme importance of risk control, viewing reasonable asset allocation (especially an adequate cash reserve) as the cornerstone of investment success. Through specific examples, the teacher revealed the investment value trap of long-term bonds and severely criticized certain misleading and detrimental practices in the financial industry, especially warning investors against low-return products like annuities and savings insurance. At the same time, he pointed out the huge uncertainty of individual stock investing and the destructive nature of short-term trading. During the Q&amp;A session, students actively shared their insights and confusions from their investment practices, family communication, and personal growth. Teacher James not only provided specific investment advice (such as the correct use and risk perception of credit loans versus stock pledges) but also guided students from a life philosophy perspective to reflect on the meaning of wealth, work, family, and personal value, encouraging everyone on the path to financial freedom to continuously enhance their cognition, maintain a positive mindset, pay attention to family and social responsibilities, and ultimately give back to society.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market fluctuations, international situations, market analysis, financial statements, economic situations, etc., are irrelevant to individual investment returns.</strong> Teacher James emphasizes that these factors are often overhyped by the media and financial institutions but have minimal impact on long-term investors&rsquo; returns. Investors should focus on long-term trends rather than short-term fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Investors should avoid being influenced by market noise and news.</strong> Misleading information in the market can easily lead investors to make wrong decisions. In the long run, these short-term fluctuations are offset by the market&rsquo;s long-term growth trend.</li>
<li><strong>Investment should be based on a strategy of long-term holding of the Nasdaq 100 index fund, without frequent trading.</strong> Frequent trading not only generates high transaction costs but also increases investment risk. The long-term holding strategy can reduce risks and enjoy the benefits of compound interest.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The risk of leveraged investing is lower than that of non-leveraged investing.</strong> Teacher James explains that those who use leverage have more cash reserves in times of crisis, making them more resilient than those without cash reserves. The key is whether the borrowed money is invested in the right assets, such as stocks of high-quality companies.</li>
<li><strong>Investors are advised to borrow early and incorporate the funds into their asset allocation.</strong> Early borrowing allows funds to be invested in the market, enjoying longer compound interest growth. Even keeping the borrowed money as a backup is safer than not being able to obtain a loan when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Newly listed funds have larger tracking errors; it is recommended to invest in established funds.</strong> Newly listed funds, due to their smaller size, require more hedging operations, resulting in larger tracking errors that affect investment returns. It is advisable to choose established funds like 00662, which have larger scale and smaller tracking errors.</li>
<li><strong>Asset allocation should be based on individual circumstances, such as the 433 or 442 strategies, with intelligent rebalancing.</strong> The 433 strategy refers to 40% core fund (e.g., QQQ), 30% leveraged fund (e.g., QLD), and 30% cash. The 442 strategy refers to 40% core fund, 40% leveraged fund, and 20% cash. Intelligent rebalancing involves transferring a portion of the profits from the leveraged fund to cash in rising years and transferring a portion of cash to the leveraged fund in declining years.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing should not exceed a certain percentage of total assets and should be combined with asset allocation to achieve automatic navigation.</strong> The amount of new borrowing each year can be gradually increased. For example, in the first year, you can borrow 1%-2% of the total assets, and then increase it slightly each year. The specific proportion depends on the individual&rsquo;s debt tolerance. In the long-term investment process, total assets grow at a rate of more than 10% per year, while debt grows at a rate of 2% per year. Therefore, borrowing money is very safe in the long run. Through intelligent rebalancing, the automatic navigation of the investment portfolio can be achieved without frequent adjustments.</li>
<li><strong>Investors should be extremely optimistic.</strong> Regardless of any disasters or market downturns, investors should remain optimistic because the market will eventually rise and break new highs.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real estate is a high-risk asset, subject to risks such as windstorms, floods, earthquakes, and fires.</strong> In the United States, in addition to the above risks, there are also risks of tornadoes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters. These disasters can lead to significant depreciation or even complete loss of property value.</li>
<li><strong>In contrast, the Nasdaq 100 index fund includes 100 companies, does not require payment of taxes, maintenance fees, insurance fees, and is not affected by natural disasters.</strong> These 100 companies are among the best in the United States and even globally, with high long-term investment returns.</li>
<li><strong>It is recommended to transfer the risk of real estate to the landlord by renting instead of owning property to avoid risks.</strong> Owning property requires various maintenance costs, taxes, and risks from natural disasters. Renting can transfer these risks to the landlord, and you only need to pay rent.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investment should control emotions, understand history, and look at the present from the future.</strong> Investing requires rationality, avoiding emotional decisions. By understanding historical market fluctuations and economic cycles, one can better grasp investment opportunities. Looking at the present from the future can strengthen confidence in long-term investment.</li>
<li><strong>The value of the Nasdaq 100 index fund will far exceed its current value in the future, and long-term holding will bring substantial returns.</strong> With the advancement of technology and economic development, the value of the Nasdaq 100 index fund will continue to grow.</li>
<li><strong>The most important goal in life is to fulfill one&rsquo;s mission, not to pursue money, fame, and power.</strong> Money is only a tool to achieve life goals, not the goal itself. One should consider how to use wealth to realize one&rsquo;s life values.</li>
<li><strong>Money is a tool, and one should learn to spend money, especially for wealthy retirees; spending money is a virtue.</strong> Retirees should learn to enjoy life and use their wealth to improve their quality of life and achieve their life goals. At the same time, spending money can promote economic flow and create more opportunities for young people.</li>
<li><strong>Elderly people who have retired and are very wealthy should spend money as a moral duty.</strong> Spending money can stimulate the economy, allowing young people to earn more, and they may also consider having children and getting married.</li>

<li><strong>In capitalism, if you have money, buy index funds, and you will become rich.</strong> In a capitalist society, investment is an important way to achieve wealth growth. Due to their diversified investment characteristics, index funds can reduce risks and obtain average market returns.</li>
<li><strong>To become a millionaire, one needs to understand borrowing.</strong> Moderate borrowing can amplify investment returns and accelerate wealth accumulation. However, it should be noted that borrowing must be based on safety and controllability.</li>
<li><strong>Real estate loans require repayment of principal and interest, and retirees should avoid such loans.</strong> The income source of retirees is usually relatively fixed, and the pressure to repay principal and interest is greater, which may affect the quality of life.</li>
<li><strong>Convert mortgages to home equity lines of credit to reduce monthly expenses.</strong> Home equity lines of credit only require interest payments, not principal repayment, which can reduce monthly repayment pressure.</li>
<li><strong>The US borrows money to develop its domestic investment economy.</strong> The US can borrow a little more money and repay it in 20 or 30 years. In fact, the US does not want to repay the debt. It borrows new debt to repay old debt. The money is never repaid, and the currency will depreciate.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing without principal repayment is acceptable.</strong> Suppose you have 30 million in retirement savings, at 2%, you can spend 600,000 a year, or 50,000 a month.</li>

<li>Question: Details of the 433 asset allocation strategy, especially the specific steps for rebalancing at the end of the year, and how to understand the concept of &ldquo;automatic navigation.&rdquo; Many students are confused about how to readjust the asset allocation back to the 433 ratio.</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: When rebalancing at the end of the year, <strong>only the leveraged fund (Q2D) and cash portions need to be adjusted, without touching the core fund (QQQ)</strong>.
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>In a rising year</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the annual return of Q2D (year-end asset - beginning-year asset). If there were additional investments during the year, subtract the amount of additional investments.</li>
<li>Transfer 1/3 of the annual return of Q2D to the cash account.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In a declining year</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate 2% of the total assets.</li>
<li>Transfer 2% of the total assets from the cash account to the Q2D account.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatic navigation</strong> means that once the initial asset allocation and annual intelligent rebalancing are completed, there is no need to frequently monitor or adjust the asset ratio, allowing the investment portfolio to operate automatically according to the preset strategy.</p>

<li>Share: Pin shared a book called &ldquo;Die with Zero,&rdquo; which puts forward a novel point of view: <strong>every meaningful experience in life is an investment, similar to financial investment. These experiences can bring spiritual returns, and these returns will increase over time.</strong> The book compares this kind of experience investment to financial investment. Every positive experience is like depositing the &ldquo;principal&rdquo; into the memory bank. Every time you recall or share these experiences afterward, you can get &ldquo;interest&rdquo;—happiness and satisfaction. As we age, these memories become more and more precious, just like compound interest in financial investment, whose value continues to grow. Pin took herself as an example. She decided to quit her job to accompany her elderly parents. Although this was a difficult decision financially, she regarded this experience as a valuable investment, and its return would far exceed the loss of money.

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment: Teacher James agreed with Pin&rsquo;s sharing and further explained that <strong>the purpose of life is to convert material energy into spiritual energy</strong>. Money is just a tool. The real purpose is to obtain spiritual satisfaction and happiness. We should use money to create beautiful experiences, not just accumulate numbers. He took a chart in the &ldquo;One Billion Investment Lecture&rdquo; as an example to illustrate how to convert material energy into spiritual energy and emphasized that ultimately we should pursue spiritual abundance.</li>

<li>Question 1: Three years ago, she mortgaged a house and borrowed 10 million NTD in a home equity line of credit, but this money has not been used. Now she has some concerns. After these three years, she wonders if she should be braver and use this money, but she is worried about her nervous personality.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James believes that Sunny&rsquo;s personality is too nervous and not suitable for complex investment operations. And pointed out that if you have a nervous personality, you are not suitable for investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Previously, she listened to some suggestions in the market and bought a large number of 20-year long-term bonds, resulting in a relatively high proportion of bonds in the current investment portfolio, and it is currently in a state of loss. Now that the market trend has changed and she is facing losses, how should she deal with this bond investment?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James pointed out that Sunny should not invest in long-term bonds and emphasized that funds should be concentrated on assets that can make money. He suggested that Sunny watch investment course videos to learn the correct investment strategy instead of blindly following various suggestions in the market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: Should she sell all the bonds now and transfer all the proceeds to buy QQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Considering that Sunny is retired and has a fixed monthly pension, it is recommended that she reallocate all assets (including bonds, cash, etc.), invest 80% of the assets in 00662 (Taiwan ETF tracking the Nasdaq 100 Index), and invest 20% of the assets in 00864B (Taiwan&rsquo;s short-term bond ETF, equivalent to cash).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 4: She still has 20-30% cash on hand. Should these cash continue to be invested in 00662 and 00864B according to the 80/20 ratio?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James আবারও emphasized that all assets need to be added up for calculation to ensure that the final investment ratio of 00662 is 80% and the investment ratio of 00864B is 20%. If the cash ratio is insufficient, she may need to sell some bonds to increase the cash ratio.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s additional explanation: Teacher James emphasized the importance of investment education and suggested that Sunny spend time watching course videos to systematically learn investment knowledge instead of just seeking a simple answer.

He realized that many people, including himself, are misled by the traditional financial system and engage in unreasonable financial behaviors such as forced savings. He believes that Teacher James&rsquo;s course system and philosophy are truthful and can help people achieve financial freedom.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment: Teacher James agreed with Zhang Yong&rsquo;s sharing and further explained the essence of the capitalist system and financial system. He pointed out that the history of the development of capitalism, especially after the Industrial Revolution, led to the emergence of the working class and gradually evolved into an invisible &ldquo;slavery&rdquo; system. The government, financial institutions, and capitalists have jointly built a &ldquo;Truman&rsquo;s World&rdquo; where most people live according to a set script without realizing it. Teacher James used the movie &ldquo;The Truman Show&rdquo; as an example to point out that this &ldquo;script&rdquo; was jointly set by capitalists, the government, and financial institutions to make most people become laborers and serve the capitalist system. Most people, including senior executives in the financial industry, do not even realize that they are &ldquo;actors&rdquo; in this system. Only a few people can see the truth and achieve true financial freedom. Teacher James emphasized that the purpose of his course is to help everyone recognize the existence of this &ldquo;scam&rdquo; and find ways to achieve financial freedom.</li>

<li>Question: Many people are busy working and living, but their behaviors and ideas are contrary to the concept of achieving financial freedom. Most people seem to be misled by the traditional financial system and make unreasonable financial plans. Zhang Yong wants to know the essential reasons for this widespread phenomenon and how to change this situation.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James explained that the root cause of this phenomenon is the capitalist system itself. Since the Industrial Revolution, the capitalist system has gradually turned most people into laborers and built a complete system to maintain this state. This system instills the concepts of &ldquo;work hard, save, and invest&rdquo; in people through multiple channels such as education, media, and financial institutions, but in fact, it is &ldquo;enslaving&rdquo; most people. He pointed out that this is a &ldquo;war without sound and breath&rdquo; and most people do not realize that they are in it. Teacher James believes that to change this situation, we must first recognize the existence of this &ldquo;scam&rdquo;, and then gradually achieve financial freedom by learning the correct investment concepts and methods. He emphasized that we cannot change the entire system, but we can change ourselves and let ourselves and our families live a better life.</li>

<li>Question 1: Tina has currently invested most of her assets in 00662 (Taiwan) and NDQ (Australia) ETFs, and plans to transfer her Australian retirement fund to NDQ in the future. She asked whether she should conduct asset allocation after completing all investments or start considering the allocation of other assets now.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James suggested that Tina conduct asset allocation as soon as possible, rather than considering it after all funds are invested in specific assets. He believes that asset allocation should be a quick decision-making process that can be completed within a day. For those who have not retired and have not borrowed money, they can choose the 433 or 442 asset allocation strategy; for those who are close to retirement or have retired, they should use the 80/20 asset allocation strategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: If according to the 442 strategy, Tina has allocated 40% of her assets to 00662 and NDQ, then after transferring the Australian retirement fund next month, should she invest in 00670L (Taiwan&rsquo;s leveraged ETF)? If the funds are kept in Australia, how should they be allocated?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James suggested that Tina treat the Australian retirement fund as a cash portion and allocate it according to tax factors. If in Australia, since the dividends of NDQ need to be taxed and the tax rate is high, it is not recommended to invest all retirement funds in NDQ. The Australian retirement fund can be used as a cash reserve, while the core fund (such as 00662) is allocated in Taiwan. If the cash reserve in Australia is not enough to meet the proportion of asset allocation, a portion of the funds can be remitted from Taiwan to Australia. He suggested that Tina consider tax factors and decide the specific asset allocation ratio according to her place of residence and post-retirement life arrangements.</li>

The fund has a high management fee of 2.95% but promises to return 75% of the principal if the Nasdaq 100 Index falls. Wen Zhang&rsquo;s younger sister is worried that she cannot control her investment behavior and may buy and sell frequently, so she is interested in this high-management-fee but guaranteed fund. Wen Zhang wants to know Teacher James&rsquo;s opinion on this fund and whether there are better investment options.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James first pointed out that if investors cannot control their investment behavior, then investing in any product may face risks. He believes that the investor&rsquo;s mentality and self-control are the key factors for investment success. Regarding specific investment advice, Teacher James suggested investing in the Canadian version of QQQ, such as QQC or XQQ. These ETFs directly track the Nasdaq 100 Index, have lower management fees, and have higher long-term investment returns. However, Teacher James also emphasized that the final investment choice should be based on the investor&rsquo;s risk tolerance and investment experience.

<li>Question: Jenny does not have much money in her Roth IRA because her income is too high to contribute directly. She currently faces a higher tax rate and is considering whether she should convert all the funds deposited in her Traditional IRA (up to $7,000 per year) to a Roth IRA, even if she needs to pay higher taxes.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James thinks this is a good idea. Since Jenny&rsquo;s Traditional IRA amount is already large, she will face a higher tax rate when withdrawing in the future. By converting funds to a Roth IRA, she can enjoy future tax-free growth. He suggested that Jenny make the conversion, even if she needs to pay taxes now, but it is worthwhile in the long run.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: In addition to the annual limit of $7,000, can more be converted?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Yes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additional explanation: Teacher James further explained why a Roth IRA is needed. He suggested buying leveraged funds (such as QLD) in the Roth IRA and allocating an equivalent amount of cash in the Traditional IRA or other taxable accounts. This can reduce the growth rate of the Traditional IRA, thereby reducing future tax burdens. For example, if there is $500,000 of QLD in the Roth IRA, then $500,000 of cash can be allocated in the Traditional IRA. As the Roth IRA grows, the cash allocation in the Traditional IRA can be increased accordingly.</li>

She believes that the volatility of QQQ in previous years was relatively small, and there would not be such large daily gains and losses unless there were major events.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s reply: Teacher James first pointed out that Julie&rsquo;s observation has a &ldquo;recency bias&rdquo;, that is, people tend to pay too much attention to recent events while ignoring long-term trends. He showed the long-term trend chart of QQQ (including linear and logarithmic charts) to illustrate that in the long run, the volatility of QQQ has not increased significantly. The recent large fluctuations are because the price of QQQ has risen to a higher level, so even a 1% fluctuation is larger in absolute terms than in the past. Teacher James emphasized that a logarithmic chart should be used to observe long-term trends because the logarithmic chart can more accurately reflect the magnitude of asset price fluctuations.</li>

Many years later, he was surprised to find that his 401k account had accumulated more than one million US dollars in assets. This case illustrates the power of compound interest. Even small regular investments can generate huge returns after a long period of accumulation.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s comment: Teacher James agreed with Houqi&rsquo;s sharing and further explained the power of compound interest. He took the US 401k plan as an example, assuming an annual investment of 20,000 US dollars, calculated at a 14% annualized rate of return, it can accumulate to 30 million US dollars after 40 years. Even if calculated at a lower 10% annualized rate of return in the past, it can also accumulate to 9 million US dollars.

<blockquote>
<p>People who borrow money are the ones with lower risks, and people who do not borrow money have extremely high risks.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Because people with cash reserves can use funds immediately in an emergency, while those without cash reserves may face the risk of a broken capital chain. Those who have loans have more cash reserves in the face of crises and have stronger risk resistance than those who do not have cash reserves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A house is a consumer product. It is a kind of money-eating support, not an investment, and it is a very high-risk support.

<p>This sentence emphasizes the attribute of real estate as a consumer product rather than an investment product, as well as its potential high risks, including natural disasters and maintenance costs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To succeed in investing, you must control your emotions. The first thing is to control your emotions. If you cannot control your emotions, please do not invest.

<p>You have to recognize that real estate is a high-risk support, so it is very strange that everyone thinks that directly investing in 100 companies is very risky, but buying a house with all their assets is also very special.

<p>This view challenges people&rsquo;s general perception of real estate as a safe asset. Real estate is a high-risk asset with risks such as windstorms, floods, earthquakes, and fires.</p>

<p>This sentence warns of the risks of speculative behavior and emphasizes the importance of long-term investment. Frequent trading not only generates high transaction costs but also increases investment risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Money is not our purpose. Money is not our purpose. The whole experience of life requires money. That is our purpose.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This sentence emphasizes the essence of money as a tool, and the real purpose of life is experience and spiritual satisfaction. We should use money to create a better experience, not just accumulate numbers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All passers-by, all the dogma of the financial industry are deceiving you.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Criticism of the traditional financial system and dogma. Only you don&rsquo;t know. Capitalists know it, politicians know it, but only the workers don&rsquo;t know it. 99.99% of the workers think that they are living in reality and in a real environment. In fact, you are living in a scripted life without knowing it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you start working today, then you can borrow $20,000 every year. Then how much more will you have? You will have an extra $30 million.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view quantifies the huge impact of leveraged investing on wealth growth. Moderate borrowing can amplify investment returns and accelerate wealth accumulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the power of compound interest, and let me give you an example. In the United States, 401K is $20,000. Suppose you invest $20,000 every year when you are young. With an annualized rate of return of 14%, in 40 years, you will have $30 million. You just invest without doing anything.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view reveals the great power of compound interest in long-term investment. Even a small amount of money can accumulate into amazing wealth through long-term compound interest growth.</p>

</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth is a Gift:</strong> Wealth is innate, and being informed of this fact makes a huge difference. While successful entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are a minority, most people need to be told that &ldquo;wealth is a gift,&rdquo; and they need to learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Index Investing and Compound Interest:</strong> Index investing is an effective way to achieve long-term stable returns, and its compounding effect is astonishing. For example, investing $1,500 per month for 40 years with a 14% annualized return will yield $2.6 million. <strong>Even small amounts of money can accumulate considerable wealth through consistent long-term investment.</strong></li>
<li><strong>High Risk, High Return?</strong>: High risk doesn&rsquo;t necessarily lead to high returns. Whether you can bear the risk determines whether you can ultimately achieve high returns. Don&rsquo;t overestimate your risk tolerance. Your risk appetite should be determined by an asset allocation that you can withstand even if your investment goes to zero. <strong>For example, if you cannot afford the risk of TQQQ going to zero, you should not invest in TQQQ.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Choosing Investment Targets</strong>: It is recommended to invest in the global Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ). Those with insufficient funds or who are already retired can consider investing in SPY or high-dividend ETFs. Avoid investing in individual stocks because they tend to disappear over the long term, while index funds can continue to exist. <strong>The half-life of individual stocks is 10 years; out of 100 stocks, there may be less than three left after 50 years.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Investment Mindset</strong>: The market will eventually rise, and investment requires patience. Always stay optimistic, even if the investment goes to zero. Learning about investing and financial management requires continuous thinking, like peeling an onion, layer by layer, to elevate the energy of the spiritual level. <strong>Investing is like the Yellow Mountain, eternally unchanging, yet different every day; every learning experience will bring new insights.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation</strong>: Asset allocation is like building a house; it is a big project that requires comprehensive planning, not something simple. It is necessary to consider many factors, such as whether you are retired, your age, income, debt, and cash flow, to formulate a reasonable asset allocation plan. <strong>You need to carefully study the articles and videos on asset allocation provided by James to develop a plan that suits you.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do Not  Blindly Trust External Information</strong>: Financial professionals often only consider their interests, so do not easily believe their advice. Think independently, study carefully, and do not be swayed by external information and noise. <strong>Most of the outside information is garbage; do not be affected by it, focus on learning James&rsquo; investment philosophy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Balancing Risk and Reward</strong>: Do not excessively pursue high returns or completely risk-free investments; balance risk and reward. Avoid changing investment strategies easily to prevent additional costs due to frequent trading. <strong>James&rsquo; investment methods can guarantee asset appreciation and relative safety, avoiding extreme situations.</strong></li>

<p><strong>IM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing: Learning about investment is like peeling an onion; at first, the amount of information is overwhelming, but as you learn more, you will gradually understand the core idea and ultimately reach the realm of &ldquo;the great Dao is simple.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: What do you think about the idea that &ldquo;investing is simple&rdquo;?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Such views often mistake ignorance for inaction and do not truly understand the complexity and risks of investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: How should we communicate with friends who don&rsquo;t understand index investing?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can start by briefly introducing the concept and advantages of index investing and suggest that they watch related videos to learn. Don&rsquo;t force them to accept it, everyone has their own choices. <strong>Just like preaching, we can only try our best to spread the message; whether it&rsquo;s ultimately accepted depends on the individual.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LAN:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: How to calculate Beta? What is the actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can refer to the link to the article on Beta calculation on the message board. The actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF may deviate from the theoretical value due to factors such as market volatility and friction costs. <strong>When market volatility is large, the wear and tear of leveraged ETFs will be more serious, resulting in an actual Beta value lower than the theoretical value.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Why is there a huge difference in final return between scenario 3 and scenario 4.1 in the 005 topic?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Scenario 4.1 is where no money is withdrawn from the investment, so the final return will be higher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: How to adjust Beta in a rising market?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response:  The adjustment of Beta should be determined by your own risk tolerance, not by the market trend. <strong>Do not try to predict the market, just keep a fixed Beta value.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 4:  For investments in Taiwan, should I choose Q2D or 00670L?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: 00670L is recommended because it includes New Taiwan dollar hedging, which can reduce the risk caused by exchange rate fluctuations. <strong>Don&rsquo;t change investment targets frequently, choose one that suits you and hold it for the long term.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nai Xin:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Wealth is a gift, just as self-confidence is a gift; everyone has potential, but it needs to be stimulated. The key to investing and financial management lies in learning. Once you have mastered the correct investment method, you can focus on your own career and life and let wealth grow naturally over time. <strong>Overcome fear, build confidence, and you can realize your potential, gain wealth, and achieve success.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Understanding &ldquo;buy whenever you have money,&rdquo; but still finding it difficult to overcome psychological fluctuations when the market rises or falls sharply.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response:  Overcoming psychological fluctuations takes time and experience. You can try to make a small number of trades, experience the impact of market fluctuations, and gradually adapt to market changes.</li>
<li>IM Supplement: You can overcome psychological barriers by imagining starting to invest two years later and understanding that &ldquo;money arrives at different points in time.&rdquo;<strong>Don&rsquo;t worry about buying at the lowest point; as long as you stick to long-term investment, you can get good returns.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hai Rui Ji:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thank you James for selflessly sharing your investment philosophy; students learn from each other and make progress together.</li>
<li>James&rsquo; investment philosophy requires continuous learning and understanding to grasp it fully. &ldquo;Never sell&rdquo; does not mean you cannot sell, but that you should develop a reasonable investment strategy based on your own situation. ** &ldquo;Never sell&rdquo; refers to mentally ignoring market fluctuations and adhering to a long-term investment philosophy.**</li>
<li>Investment philosophy needs to keep pace with the times and adjust investment strategies according to changes in the environment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question: Already answered in the video.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Li Zi:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: To overcome psychological barriers to investment, manage accounts separately, using one part for long-term investment and the other for tentative operations, such as selling covered calls. This satisfies the desire to trade and avoids losses due to frequent trading.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You only know what is best after you have experienced it. Experience in trading can lead to a firmer commitment to a long-term investment strategy. <strong>Trying different trading strategies can help you understand the advantages of long-term investment and ultimately achieve the state of &ldquo;daily reduction for the Dao.&rdquo;</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>T:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Why has the capital market in mainland China performed poorly for a long time?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Emerging markets take time to mature. The Chinese market is like the Taiwanese market 50 years ago. It has the potential to rise in the long term, but its return may be lower than that of the US market. <strong>Investment should focus on sustainable development markets. The US market has advantages in terms of systems and industries.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Under foreign exchange control, how do I invest in US index funds? Are there any risks?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can invest by purchasing ETFs listed in China that track US index funds, such as 513100. Foreign exchange controls mainly restrict the physical flow of funds, and buying ETFs is not restricted. The current scale of such investment is small and will not trigger a quota limit. <strong>Even with foreign exchange control, it is still possible to allocate global assets through legal channels.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is a Gift
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone has the potential for wealth, but they must be informed to realize it and learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning Increases Daily, the Dao Decreases Daily
&ndash; IM</p></blockquote>
<p>Learning about investing and financial management is a process of continuous improvement. At first, you will be exposed to a large amount of information, but as your understanding deepens, you will gradually simplify your investment strategy and eventually reach the state of &ldquo;the great Dao is simple.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Difficult to Return to After Seeing a Vast Ocean
&ndash; Li Zi &amp; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Only after experiencing something can you know what is best. In investing, only after actually operating and experiencing market fluctuations and the impact of different investment strategies can you more firmly choose the long-term investment strategy that suits you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The More Money You Borrow, the More Money You Have
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Understand and control risk, not avoid it. Understanding how to use leverage can accelerate wealth growth, but only with proper risk management, such as building a solid asset allocation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cash is Air
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Cash is very important and you must keep enough cash to deal with market fluctuations and emergencies.</p>
