<p>The theme of this episode is &ldquo;Investing and Financial Management, Wealth is a Gift.&rdquo; The core viewpoints  are: <strong>Wealth is innate, but one must be informed to realize it; investing and financial management is an important way to accumulate wealth; index investing is an effective method to achieve long-term stable growth; rational asset allocation and risk control are the keys to investment success; and overcoming psychological barriers in investment and solidifying the long-term investment philosophy are crucial to ultimately achieving financial freedom.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth is a Gift:</strong> Wealth is innate, and being informed of this fact makes a huge difference. While successful entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are a minority, most people need to be told that &ldquo;wealth is a gift,&rdquo; and they need to learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Index Investing and Compound Interest:</strong> Index investing is an effective way to achieve long-term stable returns, and its compounding effect is astonishing. For example, investing $1,500 per month for 40 years with a 14% annualized return will yield $2.6 million. <strong>Even small amounts of money can accumulate considerable wealth through consistent long-term investment.</strong></li>
<li><strong>High Risk, High Return?</strong>: High risk doesn&rsquo;t necessarily lead to high returns. Whether you can bear the risk determines whether you can ultimately achieve high returns. Don&rsquo;t overestimate your risk tolerance. Your risk appetite should be determined by an asset allocation that you can withstand even if your investment goes to zero. <strong>For example, if you cannot afford the risk of TQQQ going to zero, you should not invest in TQQQ.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Choosing Investment Targets</strong>: It is recommended to invest in the global Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ). Those with insufficient funds or who are already retired can consider investing in SPY or high-dividend ETFs. Avoid investing in individual stocks because they tend to disappear over the long term, while index funds can continue to exist. <strong>The half-life of individual stocks is 10 years; out of 100 stocks, there may be less than three left after 50 years.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Investment Mindset</strong>: The market will eventually rise, and investment requires patience. Always stay optimistic, even if the investment goes to zero. Learning about investing and financial management requires continuous thinking, like peeling an onion, layer by layer, to elevate the energy of the spiritual level. <strong>Investing is like the Yellow Mountain, eternally unchanging, yet different every day; every learning experience will bring new insights.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation</strong>: Asset allocation is like building a house; it is a big project that requires comprehensive planning, not something simple. It is necessary to consider many factors, such as whether you are retired, your age, income, debt, and cash flow, to formulate a reasonable asset allocation plan. <strong>You need to carefully study the articles and videos on asset allocation provided by James to develop a plan that suits you.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do Not  Blindly Trust External Information</strong>: Financial professionals often only consider their interests, so do not easily believe their advice. Think independently, study carefully, and do not be swayed by external information and noise. <strong>Most of the outside information is garbage; do not be affected by it, focus on learning James&rsquo; investment philosophy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Balancing Risk and Reward</strong>: Do not excessively pursue high returns or completely risk-free investments; balance risk and reward. Avoid changing investment strategies easily to prevent additional costs due to frequent trading. <strong>James&rsquo; investment methods can guarantee asset appreciation and relative safety, avoiding extreme situations.</strong></li>

<p><strong>IM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing: Learning about investment is like peeling an onion; at first, the amount of information is overwhelming, but as you learn more, you will gradually understand the core idea and ultimately reach the realm of &ldquo;the great Dao is simple.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: What do you think about the idea that &ldquo;investing is simple&rdquo;?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Such views often mistake ignorance for inaction and do not truly understand the complexity and risks of investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: How should we communicate with friends who don&rsquo;t understand index investing?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can start by briefly introducing the concept and advantages of index investing and suggest that they watch related videos to learn. Don&rsquo;t force them to accept it, everyone has their own choices. <strong>Just like preaching, we can only try our best to spread the message; whether it&rsquo;s ultimately accepted depends on the individual.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LAN:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: How to calculate Beta? What is the actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can refer to the link to the article on Beta calculation on the message board. The actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF may deviate from the theoretical value due to factors such as market volatility and friction costs. <strong>When market volatility is large, the wear and tear of leveraged ETFs will be more serious, resulting in an actual Beta value lower than the theoretical value.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Why is there a huge difference in final return between scenario 3 and scenario 4.1 in the 005 topic?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Scenario 4.1 is where no money is withdrawn from the investment, so the final return will be higher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: How to adjust Beta in a rising market?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response:  The adjustment of Beta should be determined by your own risk tolerance, not by the market trend. <strong>Do not try to predict the market, just keep a fixed Beta value.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 4:  For investments in Taiwan, should I choose Q2D or 00670L?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: 00670L is recommended because it includes New Taiwan dollar hedging, which can reduce the risk caused by exchange rate fluctuations. <strong>Don&rsquo;t change investment targets frequently, choose one that suits you and hold it for the long term.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nai Xin:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Wealth is a gift, just as self-confidence is a gift; everyone has potential, but it needs to be stimulated. The key to investing and financial management lies in learning. Once you have mastered the correct investment method, you can focus on your own career and life and let wealth grow naturally over time. <strong>Overcome fear, build confidence, and you can realize your potential, gain wealth, and achieve success.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Understanding &ldquo;buy whenever you have money,&rdquo; but still finding it difficult to overcome psychological fluctuations when the market rises or falls sharply.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response:  Overcoming psychological fluctuations takes time and experience. You can try to make a small number of trades, experience the impact of market fluctuations, and gradually adapt to market changes.</li>
<li>IM Supplement: You can overcome psychological barriers by imagining starting to invest two years later and understanding that &ldquo;money arrives at different points in time.&rdquo;<strong>Don&rsquo;t worry about buying at the lowest point; as long as you stick to long-term investment, you can get good returns.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hai Rui Ji:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thank you James for selflessly sharing your investment philosophy; students learn from each other and make progress together.</li>
<li>James&rsquo; investment philosophy requires continuous learning and understanding to grasp it fully. &ldquo;Never sell&rdquo; does not mean you cannot sell, but that you should develop a reasonable investment strategy based on your own situation. ** &ldquo;Never sell&rdquo; refers to mentally ignoring market fluctuations and adhering to a long-term investment philosophy.**</li>
<li>Investment philosophy needs to keep pace with the times and adjust investment strategies according to changes in the environment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question: Already answered in the video.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Li Zi:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: To overcome psychological barriers to investment, manage accounts separately, using one part for long-term investment and the other for tentative operations, such as selling covered calls. This satisfies the desire to trade and avoids losses due to frequent trading.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You only know what is best after you have experienced it. Experience in trading can lead to a firmer commitment to a long-term investment strategy. <strong>Trying different trading strategies can help you understand the advantages of long-term investment and ultimately achieve the state of &ldquo;daily reduction for the Dao.&rdquo;</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>T:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Why has the capital market in mainland China performed poorly for a long time?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Emerging markets take time to mature. The Chinese market is like the Taiwanese market 50 years ago. It has the potential to rise in the long term, but its return may be lower than that of the US market. <strong>Investment should focus on sustainable development markets. The US market has advantages in terms of systems and industries.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Under foreign exchange control, how do I invest in US index funds? Are there any risks?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can invest by purchasing ETFs listed in China that track US index funds, such as 513100. Foreign exchange controls mainly restrict the physical flow of funds, and buying ETFs is not restricted. The current scale of such investment is small and will not trigger a quota limit. <strong>Even with foreign exchange control, it is still possible to allocate global assets through legal channels.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is a Gift
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone has the potential for wealth, but they must be informed to realize it and learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning Increases Daily, the Dao Decreases Daily
&ndash; IM</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learning about investing and financial management is a process of continuous improvement. At first, you will be exposed to a large amount of information, but as your understanding deepens, you will gradually simplify your investment strategy and eventually reach the state of &ldquo;the great Dao is simple.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Difficult to Return to After Seeing a Vast Ocean
&ndash; Li Zi &amp; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only after experiencing something can you know what is best. In investing, only after actually operating and experiencing market fluctuations and the impact of different investment strategies can you more firmly choose the long-term investment strategy that suits you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The More Money You Borrow, the More Money You Have
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understand and control risk, not avoid it. Understanding how to use leverage can accelerate wealth growth, but only with proper risk management, such as building a solid asset allocation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cash is Air
&ndash; James</p>

<p>Cash is very important and you must keep enough cash to deal with market fluctuations and emergencies.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth is accumulated slowly, and enjoying the process of wealth accumulation is the meaning of life.</strong> Getting rich overnight or quickly is not the best way. Slowly accumulating wealth and enjoying it allows you to experience the true meaning of life and learn and grow from it.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t blindly pursue high returns while ignoring risks.</strong> Many people pursue quick riches and hope for super high returns, but often overlook the risks involved, which may ultimately lead to losses outweighing gains. Learn to assess risk and choose an investment strategy that matches your risk tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>Investing requires finding a definite eternity, ignoring market noise, and maintaining inner peace.</strong> Index fund investing is a definite and eternal strategy that does not require painstaking research and operation. Simply holding for the long term can yield considerable returns.</li>
<li><strong>Investment is a loser&rsquo;s game, not seeking to win, but seeking not to lose.</strong>  In investing, avoiding mistakes is more important than pursuing victory. Index fund investing can help investors reduce mistakes and ultimately achieve victory.</li>
<li><strong>Buying in a lump sum at any time and holding for the long term is superior to other investment methods.</strong> Investing early and holding for the long term maximizes returns and delivers the best investment returns.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to distinguish between what can be done, what is effective, what can be worried about, and what is not worth worrying about.</strong> Focus your energy on important and solvable issues, ignore those that are irrelevant or beyond your control to improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t work too hard, let your money work for you.</strong> Put your money into the market and let it create wealth for you instead of devoting all your energy to work. Learn to utilize investment tools to achieve passive wealth growth.</li>
<li><strong>All pressure comes from expectations, and all worries come from not having a solution.</strong> Lower your expectations and actively seek solutions to relieve stress and anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to transfer pressure to those who can bear it and think about solutions for the worst-case scenario.</strong> Don&rsquo;t bear the pressure alone, learn to seek help, and think in advance about solutions to the worst-case scenario to calmly deal with challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain inner peace, focus on the important things, and ignore the insignificant things.</strong> Stick to simple things, don&rsquo;t get involved in complex things, to maintain inner peace and focus on what really matters in life.</li>
<li><strong>Account security is the primary issue in investing. Choose a large, reputable brokerage to open an account and avoid using online brokers.</strong> Online brokers have security risks, such as account theft and asset freezing. Choosing a large, reputable brokerage can better protect your account security.</li>

<p><strong>Dave:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
Shared the results of James&rsquo; TQQQ simulation backtest and raised the question of how to avoid the risk of a sharp TQQQ drawdown.</li>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
James believes that it is impossible to predict the market and avoid all risks completely. The important thing is to control risk exposure and avoid over-betting. If you are worried about the volatility of TQQQ, you can choose a more conservative investment strategy, such as QQQ. James also reminds everyone to distinguish between personal thinking and public advice, and not to be easily swayed by the thoughts of others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minjianlian:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
Shared his experience of investing in stocks through his company&rsquo;s savings association, as well as discussions about the MAGS fund and emergency funds.</li>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ol>
<li>About the MAGS fund: James believes that it is uncertain whether the MAGS fund can outperform QQQ in the long term. Investment should choose targets that have been tested by time, such as QQQ or SPY.</li>
<li>About emergency funds: James believes that emergency funds are a personal responsibility and government policies cannot be relied upon entirely. Everyone should prepare sufficient emergency funds according to their own circumstances to cope with contingencies.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
Regarding the performance of 00670L, James explained the performance difference caused by USD hedging and how to solve it by investing in QLD through sub-brokerage. He emphasized that Beta and ROI are different concepts. Beta represents volatility, not ROI. The investment model in Taiwan needs to be adjusted according to specific circumstances, such as  maintenance margin requirements and exchange rate fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>JJU:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
Shared his insights on market unpredictability and the importance of mentors and friends. He believes that investing, in addition to selecting good targets, is more about maintaining inner peace and enhancing one&rsquo;s spiritual level.</li>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ol>
<li>About the difference between reinvest and buy share: James explained the difference between reinvesting and buying shares. The former automatically invests dividends or capital gains into the investment target, while the latter uses new funds to buy shares.</li>
<li>About the fund ratio of Roth IRA and Individual Brokerage Account: It is recommended to maximize the Roth IRA limit if possible.</li>
<li>About real estate mortgage investment: It is recommended to sell the property if possible to reduce the risk of investing in real estate. Otherwise, consider a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) for investment, but pay attention to risk control and ensure that you can repay the loan on time. HELOC is a revolving credit line, similar to a credit card, which can be withdrawn and repaid at any time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Draft down:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
Proposed the possibility of leveraging 0% interest credit cards for investment and using the box spread strategy to increase capital utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ol>
<li>About credit card investment: James believes that credit card limits are limited and there is a risk of not being able to renew the loan, making it unsuitable as a main source of investment funds. It is only suitable for short-term turnover of small amounts of funds.</li>
<li>About the box spread strategy: James believes that the box spread strategy is too complex and risky and is not recommended for ordinary investors.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ol>
<li>How to overcome short-term pain in the investment process: James suggested lowering expectations, not pursuing perfection or getting rich quickly, finding solutions to problems, and transferring the pressure to those who can bear it, such as superiors or more experienced individuals. Think about solutions for the worst-case scenario, such as job loss or investment losses, and maintain a positive mindset, believing that the problem will eventually be solved.</li>
<li>About non-US tax resident investing in US stocks: James believes that non-US tax residents can use their passports to open brokerage accounts in the US without a Social Security Number. It is recommended to choose large, reputable brokers, such as Charles Schwab, and avoid using online brokers, such as Webull and Robinhood, as online brokers have security risks and imperfect regulations.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Investment is a loser&rsquo;s game, not seeking to win, but seeking not to lose.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In investing, avoiding mistakes is more important than pursuing victory. Choosing the right investment target, formulating a reasonable investment strategy and strictly adhering to discipline can reduce mistakes and ultimately achieve long-term stable returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Buying in a lump sum at any time and holding for the long term is superior to other investment methods.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Investing early and holding for the long term maximizes returns and delivers the best investment returns. Time is a friend of investment. Starting early allows time to work its magic of compounding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All pressure comes from expectations, and all worries come from not having a solution.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lower your expectations and actively seek solutions to relieve stress and anxiety. When facing challenges, maintain a positive attitude and believe that you can find a way to solve the problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is accumulated slowly, and enjoying the process of wealth accumulation is the meaning of life.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting rich overnight or quickly is not the best way. Slowly accumulating wealth and enjoying it allows you to experience the true meaning of life. Investing is a long-term process. Don&rsquo;t be impatient and enjoy the process of wealth accumulation, learning and growing from it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good teachers and helpful friends are important. You may not be right if you agree with someone.
&ndash; JJU</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the investment process, be good at learning and thinking. Don&rsquo;t blindly believe anyone&rsquo;s point of view, including teachers and friends. Make your own independent thinking and judgment to make the right investment decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Account security is the primary issue in investing.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Choosing a large, reputable brokerage to open an account, such as Charles Schwab, can better protect your account security. Avoid using online brokers as online brokers have security risks and imperfect regulations.</p>

<p>This session&rsquo;s theme focuses on the <strong>mindset and discipline of long-term investing</strong>. Teacher James&rsquo;s core message is that the vast majority of people (99.9999%) lack the ability for short-term market timing. Acknowledging one&rsquo;s own ignorance and holding for the long term is the correct path to wealth. He uses the &ldquo;Cave Allegory&rdquo; to illustrate the limited vision of short-term investors, emphasizing that the investment timeframe should far exceed one&rsquo;s working years. Successful investing requires overcoming the fear gene inherent in human nature, practicing &ldquo;anti-human nature,&rdquo; and abandoning erroneous asset concepts (like real estate worship) to ultimately achieve a &ldquo;life of hundreds of millions&rdquo; through disciplined investing.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Contradiction Between Investing and Working Years</strong>: People are willing to work for 40 years but view investing with the short-sighted perspective of a few days, months, or even a year. This is extremely irrational. The teacher sharply points out that this behavior means &ldquo;there&rsquo;s something wrong with their eyes, or their brain is flooded.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>The Cave Allegory</strong>: Short-term investors are like people living in a cave, satisfied with their own narrow cognition and making excuses for their poverty (such as claiming long-term investing is high-risk). No matter how you try to persuade them, it is difficult for them to step out of their cognitive cave; this is &ldquo;destiny.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>The Essence of Wealth</strong>: Wealth is a gift that comes automatically, but many people dare not accept it due to fear and a scarcity mindset.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Longevity and Investing</strong>: In the future, the average human lifespan may exceed 100 years. For those who don&rsquo;t invest, longevity is a tragedy; for those who understand investing, longevity means having more time to create enormous wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Compound Interest Calculation Examples</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Investing NT$10,000 (approx. US$300) per month at a 12% annualized return</strong>: Results in NT$9 million (approx. US$300k) in 20 years, NT$30 million (approx. US$1 million) in 30 years, and NT$100 million in 40 years.</li>
<li><strong>Investing NT$20,000 (approx. US$700) per month at a 12% annualized return</strong>: Results in NT$18 million (approx. US$600k) in 20 years, NT$60 million (approx. US$2 million) in 30 years, and NT$200 million (approx. US$7 million) in 40 years.</li>
<li><strong>Investing NT$20,000 (approx. US$700) per month at a 15% annualized return (like QQQ)</strong>: Results in NT$26 million (approx. US$800k) in 20 years, NT$110 million (approx. US$3 million) in 30 years, and NT$460 million (approx. US$15 million) in 40 years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: As long as one adheres to long-term investing, everyone should have a life of immense wealth. Even if you start at 40 or 50, you still have 40 years of investment time if you live to 90.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wrong vs. Right Investment Duration</strong>: It&rsquo;s very strange that people are willing to take on a 30-year mortgage for a wrong asset (a house) yet use an extremely short timeframe to measure a right investment (an index fund).</li>
<li><strong>The Huge Risks of Real Estate</strong>: Houses face physical risks like fire, floods, earthquakes, and tornadoes, as well as quality issues like sea-sand concrete structures. Furthermore, liquidity is extremely poor, and job loss could lead to the property being auctioned off by the bank.</li>
<li><strong>Overcoming the Fear Gene in Human Nature</strong>: Our ancestors survived by running at the slightest disturbance while hunting. This DNA of &ldquo;running at the sight of risk&rdquo; has been passed down, causing investors to panic sell during market volatility.</li>
<li><strong>The Key to Success—Go Against Human Nature</strong>: To succeed in investing, one must overcome this genetic defect and &ldquo;go against human nature,&rdquo; not treating money as money. You must learn on your own; listening to the teacher is important, but without self-study and practice, you cannot succeed.</li>
<li><strong>The Correct Mentality for Buying a House</strong>: There is no risk only when you can buy a house like you buy a pair of slippers—if it breaks, you can easily get a new pair. Renting allows you to always live in the newest house, while holding on to a small, old, shabby one is meaningless.</li>

<li><strong>Time Allocation</strong>: Spending time talking about politics reduces the time you have to manage your own assets. Instead of protesting on the streets, it&rsquo;s better to spend time on asset planning and tax-saving strategies.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He and his nearly 20-year-old son studied Teacher James&rsquo;s course #00451 together and had in-depth discussions; the son showed great interest. He plans to open an account for his son with startup capital and set up monthly investments, allowing him to witness the miracle of compounding from a young age. He also wants to help his relatives&rsquo; children in a similar way to guide them towards financial freedom.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This is an excellent approach. Learning and discussing with your children is the best form of education. Teaching children about investing and financial management is more important than worrying about their studies or job. Once the problem of wealth is solved, 99% of life&rsquo;s difficulties are also solved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: Besides the 4-2-4 part of his asset allocation, he also casually invests US$1,000 in TQQQ every month. He worries that this part will become enormous in twenty or thirty years. If a major bear market like in 2000 or this year occurs, causing a 90% crash, how should he handle it? Should he just leave it there, or should he convert a portion to cash at a certain stage (e.g., upon reaching 10 or 50 million)?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Those who hold leveraged ETFs <strong>must perform a &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; once a year</strong>. When a leveraged ETF rises, you must move a portion of the profits (say, one-third) to cash. When it falls, you can use this cash to buy back in, which will actually improve long-term performance. Don&rsquo;t assume that holding without any action yields the highest return; one major crash can bring you back to square one. This operation is very important, or you will face the risk you&rsquo;re worried about.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2 (Follow-up)</strong>: Does this small monthly investment in TQQQ also need to be part of the rebalancing?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Yes. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how you invest each month. The key is to look at the total profit of the entire TQQQ account at the end of the year. Treat the monthly investments and the existing TQQQ assets as a single portfolio, calculate the total profit at year-end, and then perform the rebalancing operation.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: His wealth recently hit a new high, and he still feels excited, unlike the teacher who remains calm. He feels he still needs to cultivate his mindset. He believes this desire to celebrate shows he hasn&rsquo;t completely shed his attachment to gains and losses.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: He shared his observation of tourists at a restaurant (from Ukraine, Utah) who flew in for trivial matters. They lived happily but seemed to have no concept of investing. This made him reflect on how his own mindset still fluctuates with the market index.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: How can one cultivate a mindset like the teacher&rsquo;s, remaining completely unfazed by wealth growth?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: First, you must foresee your future wealth. Your assets will have two more zeros added to them, going from 10 million to 1 billion US dollars. When you have 1 billion, what&rsquo;s spending 200 million? You must learn to see your current wealth from a future perspective and learn to spend money. Second, pay attention to your health. He shared some personal dietary insights (e.g., oat milk raises blood sugar; don&rsquo;t be afraid to eat healthy fats and meats, but control carbs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: What kind of significant changes will the bill on digital currencies passed by the US House of Representatives bring to the financial market?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is a crucial step for the US to seize and consolidate control in the digital currency space.
<ol>
<li><strong>Regulate Stablecoins</strong>: Stablecoins like USDT and USDC are essentially digitized US dollars. The US must bring them under regulation (e.g., KYC) to maintain the dollar&rsquo;s credibility and hegemony. Otherwise, if tech companies are allowed to run wild and a collapse occurs, it will severely damage the dollar&rsquo;s reputation.</li>
<li><strong>Control Core Digital Assets</strong>: Besides USD stablecoins, mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have emerged. The US must acquire and control large reserves of them, just as it controls gold. Otherwise, in the future digital world, the dollar will lose half its influence. Trump&rsquo;s push to include Bitcoin in reserves follows this logic. In the future, Real World Assets (RWA) will also be on-chain, making it even more necessary for the US to control the underlying technology and core assets.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3 (Follow-up)</strong>: Would it cause chaos if other countries also issue stablecoins? If Bitcoin&rsquo;s price soars to an astronomical level, will it decouple from the US dollar?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: No. Other countries&rsquo; stablecoins are like their fiat currencies; they lack international usability and mainly circulate domestically. Globally, people will still choose stablecoins pegged to the US dollar. The essence of USDT/USDC is a &ldquo;digital US dollar bill,&rdquo; primarily used for large, fast transfers and to help people in third-world countries avoid the devaluation of their local currency. It has little impact on the average person&rsquo;s life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 4</strong>: Netflix&rsquo;s recent earnings were good, but its stock price fell. The market&rsquo;s interpretation is that this was due to increased overseas revenue from a depreciating dollar, not substantial growth. What is your view on the impact of this phenomenon on other global companies in QQQ?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: First, Netflix has risen nearly 90% in the past year, far outpacing QQQ, so its valuation might have been a bit high, making a pullback normal. The news interpretations are just post-hoc rationalizations; don&rsquo;t take them seriously. A 5% drop is nothing; a real plunge is a 20% drop at the open.</li>
<li><strong>Jumin&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This could be the financial circle manipulating stock prices for profit, a phenomenon of &ldquo;fleecing retail investors.&rdquo; The drop doesn&rsquo;t need a reason.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: He has been through two bear markets. The first time, he had no cash reserves, panic-sold at the bottom, and suffered heavy losses. The second time, he learned his lesson, held on, and his assets have now reached a new high. He has also started to build a 20% cash reserve. He emphasized the gap between theory and practice and the importance of overcoming bad habits.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: Using the Morningstar tool, he analyzed that from the beginning of 2005 to the present day, including dividend reinvestment, QQQ returned 16.5x, SPY 6.79x, and gold 6.3x. This data powerfully demonstrates that investing in technology (QQQ) is far superior to investing in the S&amp;P 500 and gold.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 3</strong>: He warmly invited Teacher James and classmates to visit Point Reyes National Seashore, north of San Francisco, offering to be their guide.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Regarding rebalancing, suppose the initial allocation is 70% QQQ, 10% QLD, and 20% cash. After a bull market, it becomes 75% QQQ, 17% QLD. At this point, if you only sell one-third of the profits, the cash percentage will not return to the initial 20%. How should this be handled?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: For retirees, the core focus is the <strong>absolute amount of your cash reserve, not its percentage of total assets</strong>. Your goal is to have enough cash to cover 15 years of living expenses. As your total assets grow, even if the cash percentage drops from 30% to 25%, it&rsquo;s fine as long as its absolute amount is sufficient to cover 15 years of expenses (or even more). Therefore, the purpose of rebalancing is to ensure you have a sufficient cash &ldquo;moat,&rdquo; not to mechanically maintain a fixed percentage. For young people, it is advisable to try to maintain a 30% cash allocation from the beginning.</li>

<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: It is not advisable to look at it separately; you should treat the family&rsquo;s assets as a single entity. Her current overall allocation is approximately 74% vanilla, 10% leveraged, and 16% cash. If they plan to retire, 16% cash may not be enough to cover 15 years of expenses. <strong>The correct approach is: first, set aside enough cash from the total assets to cover 15 years of expenses. Then, allocate the remaining funds to vanilla and leveraged ETFs proportionally.</strong> The cash reserve is the first priority.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: She detailed her emotional journey following the teacher&rsquo;s investment advice, from individual stocks to QQQ, and then to trying TQQQ. She feels confused and dissatisfied with the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s policies, believing they have caused unnecessary market volatility that has affected her TQQQ investment.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: With limited funds and in the wealth accumulation phase, how should one correctly handle TQQQ? She is unsure if TQQQ can truly outperform QQQ in the early stages and is confused about when to add more funds and how to rebalance.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Ignore Macro Noise</strong>: The Federal Reserve&rsquo;s policies, the economic situation, etc., are all irrelevant to our investments. Don&rsquo;t worry about them.</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Leverage Are Not Contradictory</strong>: Holding cash and rebalancing does not result in a worse long-term rate of return. By allocating a certain percentage to leveraged ETFs (like TQQQ/QLD), your total portfolio&rsquo;s Beta value (risk exposure) can still reach or even exceed 1.0, even while holding 30% cash.</li>
<li><strong>Discipline is Key</strong>: Don&rsquo;t try to time the market. When you have money, buy according to your predetermined allocation. Rebalance once at the end or beginning of the year. If TQQQ is profitable, sell a portion of the profits and convert it to cash. If it&rsquo;s at a loss, you can use a small portion of cash to add to your position (but be extremely cautious not to deplete your cash).</li>
<li><strong>The Risk of TQQQ</strong>: TQQQ takes longer to recover after a bear market. The risk is extremely high without sufficient cash and discipline.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: A philosophical question. After becoming a multimillionaire in the future, what kind of mindset should one have to preserve that wealth? He mentioned the &ldquo;theory of karmic blessings&rdquo; and the examples of lottery winners who end up bankrupt.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is an excellent question. The key to preserving wealth is to enhance your &ldquo;spiritual energy.&rdquo;
<ol>
<li><strong>Understand</strong>: You must personally learn and understand how wealth is generated; you cannot entrust your money to others to manage.</li>
<li><strong>Nourish the Mind</strong>: Supplement your soul&rsquo;s nourishment by reading (philosophy, classics), meditating, etc., to keep your mind stable and not trapped by greed, anger, and ignorance.</li>
<li><strong>Health</strong>: Take care of your body. Without health, no amount of money is useful.</li>
<li><strong>Know How to Spend Money</strong>: Learn to spend money and enjoy life. The more you spend, the better your spirit becomes.</li>
<li><strong>Reflect</strong>: Reflect daily on whether your spiritual energy has grown. Don&rsquo;t trust the superficial phenomena perceived by your eyes, ears, nose, and tongue; trust your inner thoughts.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: In Canada, there are multiple ETF versions of QQQ. In a tax-free account (TFSA), is there still a point in investing in a non-distributing version like HXQ?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Yes, HXQ is a good choice in any account due to its fee and tax structure advantages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: If my company provides a Defined Benefit Pension, can I consider it as part of my cash allocation in retirement, thereby eliminating the need to hold a large amount of cash?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: <strong>Absolutely not</strong>. A pension is a cash flow, not a large sum of cash you can withdraw at any time. If you face an emergency (like your house collapsing and needing US$500,000 to rebuild), the pension cannot meet that need. You must maintain a sufficient cash reserve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: I&rsquo;m confused about Beta calculation. Why does Yahoo Finance show QQQ&rsquo;s Beta as 1.41, while the teacher&rsquo;s system uses 1.0? How do I convert it?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Don&rsquo;t look at external data. Different systems use different reference points. Yahoo Finance usually uses the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) as the reference (Beta=1.0), whereas our system uses QQQ as the reference (Beta=1.0). It&rsquo;s just like using meters versus feet as units of measurement; the standard is different. Please use our calculation method: QQQ=1, QLD=2, TQQQ=3, Cash=0.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 4</strong>: What is the order of the &ldquo;4-3-3&rdquo; allocation the teacher mentioned?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The order is: 40% vanilla ETF (QQQ), 30% leveraged ETF (like QLD), and 30% cash. He pointed out that this question indicates the student has not watched the videos carefully.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>You will only succeed in investing when you are not human.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: This statement was made by Teacher James when explaining why investing requires overcoming human weaknesses. He believes that the innate fear gene in humans (like the instinct to avoid risk while hunting in ancient times) is the main cause of investment failure. Therefore, one must &ldquo;go against human nature&rdquo; to remain rational during market fluctuations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I write a prescription for Lucy or someone else, you can&rsquo;t take it; you&rsquo;ll be poisoned.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: At the end of the course, Teacher James sternly warned students that asset allocation is highly personal. He emphasized that one cannot blindly copy the allocation ratios he suggests for a particular student (like 4-3-3 or 6-1-3). Everyone&rsquo;s situation is different and requires a customized plan; otherwise, it&rsquo;s as dangerous as taking someone else&rsquo;s prescription medicine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should have this kind of capability when buying a house&hellip; if the house collapses, I&rsquo;ll just buy a new one&hellip; If you would be ruined if the house collapsed, then why would you buy a house?
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: When comparing real estate and stock investments, the teacher used this vivid example to illustrate risk tolerance. He believes that you are only truly capable of holding an asset when its loss would not cause a devastating blow to your financial situation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Politics is for the poor&hellip; The rich don&rsquo;t talk about politics; they only use policies to get rich.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: This point aims to illustrate that energy and time should be invested where they are most effective. The teacher believes that instead of spending time on political issues that one cannot change, it is better to study and utilize the existing economic and legal rules to create wealth for oneself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your wealth can only be as great as your spiritual energy is high.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: When answering a philosophical question about how to preserve immense wealth, the teacher presented this core idea. He believes that the capacity to hold wealth is directly related to one&rsquo;s inner cultivation and spiritual realm, which needs to be continuously enhanced through learning, meditation, and other practices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slow is fast.
&ndash; Jumin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: A student used this philosophical phrase in the comment section in response to the discussion about TQQQ, emphasizing that moving forward steadily and not taking shortcuts in investing is ultimately the faster way to reach the destination.</p>

</h2>
<p>This session was a deep &ldquo;baptism&rdquo; into the investment mindset and discipline. With his characteristically sharp and direct style, Teacher James condemned the irrationality of short-term speculation and repeatedly demonstrated the necessity and superiority of long-termism from the perspectives of human nature, history, and mathematics. The &ldquo;Cave Allegory&rdquo; vividly depicts how cognitive limitations lead to poverty, while overcoming human fear and establishing a correct view of assets are necessary steps on the path to wealth. The Q&amp;A session was exceptionally active, addressing core investor pain points from the risk control of leveraged ETFs and the dynamic adjustment of asset allocation to cash requirements for retirement planning and the philosophical considerations of managing immense wealth. Ultimately, all discussions converged on a single core idea: <strong>Investment success is not just a victory of technique and strategy, but a comprehensive victory of cognition, mindset, and discipline.</strong></p>
