      <description>In this session, Teacher James details the &amp;#39;Flexible Smart Rebalancing&amp;#39; strategy developed by student Peng, an enhanced version of the traditional smart rebalancing aimed at improving asset allocation security. The core of the strategy is to set a cash-year threshold, flexibly adjusting the funding source for rebalancing. Additionally, James discusses withdrawal rates corresponding to different Beta values and introduces high-dividend ETFs like JEPQ as a solution for retirees with insufficient cash flow.</description>

<p>This session delves into the &ldquo;Flexible Smart Rebalancing&rdquo; optimization strategy. Its core idea is to add a &ldquo;cash years&rdquo; criterion to the traditional smart rebalancing framework. When cash reserves fall below a preset number of years (e.g., 15 years), market downturns will no longer deplete cash. Instead, the underlying fund (e.g., QQQ) will be used to buy more of the leveraged fund to protect cash flow and enhance the portfolio&rsquo;s security. Concurrently, for retirees with higher cash flow needs, an alternative solution of allocating to high-dividend ETFs (such as JEPQ) is proposed.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strategy Background</strong>: This strategy was optimized and back-tested by student Peng, based on Teacher James&rsquo;s smart rebalancing concept, with the goal of increasing the maintenance rate (security).</li>
<li><strong>Core Mechanism</strong>: It introduces a customizable &ldquo;cash years&rdquo; variable (e.g., 15 years) as a threshold for switching strategies.
<ol>
<li><strong>When Cash Level is Below 15 Years</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>During a Market Upturn</strong>: Profits from the leveraged fund are moved into cash, with the goal of replenishing cash reserves to over 15 years as quickly as possible. Consider transferring 30%, 40%, or 50% of the profitable portion to accelerate cash accumulation.</li>
<li><strong>During a Market Downturn</strong>: <strong>Do not use cash</strong>. Instead, sell the underlying fund (e.g., QQQ) to buy the leveraged fund (e.g., TQQQ) to maintain the Beta value while protecting precious cash reserves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>When Cash Level is Above 15 Years</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The strategy reverts to traditional smart rebalancing. During a market downturn, cash can be used to buy more of the leveraged fund.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Strategy Version Evolution (1.0 vs. 2.0)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Version 1.0</strong>: The core is to reduce downside risk. During upturns, profits from the leveraged fund are converted to cash.</li>
<li><strong>Version 2.0</strong>: With sufficient cash (above the threshold), it increases upside potential. During upturns, profits from the leveraged fund can be moved into the underlying fund (QQQ) instead of cash. This slows down the decrease in Beta, allowing for the capture of more upside opportunities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Back-testing Conclusion</strong>: Data shows that under different Beta settings, the &ldquo;Flexible Rebalancing&rdquo; strategy, especially when using the appropriate version for different Beta values, generally provides a higher minimum maintenance rate than traditional smart rebalancing, meaning higher security.</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationship Between Beta and Withdrawal Rate</strong>: The recommended annual withdrawal rate varies with the portfolio&rsquo;s volatility (Beta):
<ul>
<li>Beta 1.0: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.0%</li>
<li>Beta 0.9: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.2%</li>
<li>Beta 0.8: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.4%</li>
<li>Beta 0.7: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.8%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Solution for High Withdrawal Rates</strong>: When the required withdrawal rate <strong>exceeds 3%</strong>, traditional asset allocation becomes riskier. It is recommended to introduce high-dividend assets to supplement cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Introduction to High-Dividend ETFs (JEPQ &amp; JEPI)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>JEPQ</strong>: Annualized dividend yield of about 10%. Approximately 80% of its assets are in QQQ, with the other 20% generating cash flow by selling covered calls. Its Beta is about 0.78, making it less volatile than QQQ and suitable for retirees needing high cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>JEPI</strong>: Annualized dividend yield of about 8.37%. It operates based on SPY and has a lower Beta of about 0.57.</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: These ETFs are primarily suitable for investors who are <strong>already retired, have insufficient principal, and are highly dependent on stable cash flow</strong>. They are not recommended for young investors still in the asset accumulation phase, as their long-term capital appreciation potential is far lower than QQQ.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Principles</strong>: Even if you don&rsquo;t understand the complex strategy details, grasp these key principles:
<ol>
<li><strong>Cash is King</strong>: If using a stock pledge loan, maintain a cash position of at least 30%.</li>
<li><strong>15-Year Cash Goal</strong>: Strive to maintain cash reserves equivalent to at least 15 years of living expenses as an important safety buffer.</li>
<li><strong>Beta Control</strong>: Keep the overall portfolio Beta below 1.0 to navigate market fluctuations smoothly.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Assets and Inflation</strong>: Stocks are real assets, and their intrinsic value is not eroded by inflation. When currency depreciates, the price of assets (stock prices) will rise to reflect their value. Therefore, do not sell quality assets (like QQQ) due to fears of inflation or short-term market volatility. Selling at any time is a mistake.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing:
<ol>
<li><strong>Inspiration for Flexible Rebalancing 1.0</strong>: It originated from Teacher James&rsquo;s mention that when cash is less than 15 years, one should not use cash to buy leveraged funds during a down year. Based on this, he conducted quantitative back-testing and tested different cash-year thresholds (13, 14, 15, 16 years) and the effect of transferring different percentages (30%, 40%, 50%) of profits to cash during upturns.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration for Flexible Rebalancing 2.0</strong>: Inspired by a strategy shared by student Lin. He pondered whether, when the cash position is sufficient, profits from the leveraged fund could be moved to the underlying fund (instead of cash) to slow the decline in Beta, thereby capturing more future upside potential.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Version 1.0 aims to &ldquo;reduce downside risk,&rdquo; while Version 2.0 builds on this to &ldquo;increase upside potential.&rdquo; He emphasized that the current back-testing period is limited and this is still his personal exploration, not to be taken as a final conclusion. However, the general direction is that a higher cash position leads to a higher maintenance rate.</li>

<li>Question: Why do you recommend withdrawing 2% annually instead of borrowing the full 20% of the pledge limit from the start?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a critical risk control issue. If you borrow 20% at once and the market experiences a major crash like in 2000 (an 85% drop), your assets would fall from $1 million to $150,000, but your debt would still be $200,000. you would go bankrupt immediately. By withdrawing 2% annually, even if the market declines for three or four consecutive years, you would have only used 8% of your total assets, and your assets would still be far greater than your liabilities, allowing you to survive the crisis safely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing: He observed that QQQ&rsquo;s annual return (23.29%) has surpassed VT&rsquo;s (19.92%), refuting an influencer&rsquo;s previous claim that VT would crush QQQ.

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Two things are especially important in investing: first, clarifying your investment Purpose, and second, setting a matching Target. The most dangerous situation is a mismatch between purpose and target. For example, investing with a mindset of entertainment (gambling) but expecting a stable cash flow or high returns will inevitably lead to disaster. Many friends around her made this mistake by engaging in all sorts of frantic trading during a bull market.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Very well said. It&rsquo;s like someone who does drugs and stays up all night but expects to be healthy—an impossible task. The actions of most people are contrary to their ultimate goals, but they don&rsquo;t realize it themselves. This is a lifelong tragedy.</li>

She shared her personal experience to encourage new students, saying that the teacher has already considered various risks for everyone. As long as you listen carefully and execute, you will surely gain understanding.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your situation is excellent. Since your basic living expenses are covered by this $100,000 stable cash flow, you don&rsquo;t need to reserve that many years of cash. Depending on your comfort level, you can keep, for instance, 5 years of cash or 10% of your total assets in cash as a backup. The rest of your funds can be confidently invested in QQQ and leveraged funds.</li>

<li>Question 1: Most of her funds are in a US retirement account (a Rollover IRA from a 401k) and she was told she cannot use them for a stock pledge loan. This might prevent her from retiring early. How should she handle this?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a common trap. He does not recommend over-contributing to retirement accounts (like the Mega Backdoor Roth). The remedy now is: immediately stop contributing more money to the retirement account and focus all your efforts on building a personal brokerage account. At the same time, you should start converting funds from your Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA annually as soon as possible. Within the IRA, you can also allocate: put a small amount in a Roth IRA to buy TQQQ, so the high-growth portion is tax-free; keep the majority in the Traditional IRA holding QQQ or cash, which will reduce the tax burden during conversion.</li>
</ul>

<li>Question 2: Are JEPQ and JEPI meant to be replacements for QQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Not replacements. They are tools for a specific group of people (retired, insufficient principal, need high cash flow). Those still in the asset accumulation phase should not touch them. The funding allocation order for retirees should be: 1. Meet cash flow needs (JEPQ), 2. Set aside an emergency fund, 3. Only if there is money left over, consider investing in QQQ for growth.</li>

<li>Question 1: In the event of future hyperinflation, which is a better store of value, real estate or stocks? Can the stock market withstand the test?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Stocks are assets. Inflation means money is worthless, but the value of the asset remains. At that time, the price of the asset (stock price) will rise to reflect its real value. Short-term market drops are due to human fear, not value destruction.</li>

<li>Question 2: Is the 10% dividend from JEPQ fixed? If the principal drops from $500,000 to $300,000, will the dividend also decrease proportionally?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Its dividend amount is relatively stable; it does not fluctuate strictly as a percentage of the principal. It&rsquo;s more like an annuity, designed to provide a steady stream of cash flow. So even if the market value drops, the dividend amount you receive will not decrease proportionally.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: It was because of a specific case: a 72-year-old student with only $600,000 in principal who needs $40,000 a year for living expenses. To help solve his problem, I researched high-dividend products and found JEPQ and JEPI to be relatively stable options. This is because they are not purely derivatives; they hold a large amount of real assets (80% index components), so they can be considered. This is to solve the cash flow problem for seniors, not a recommendation for the average investor.</li>

<li>Sharing: He shared the story of a 78-year-old relative in his family who is in financial difficulty due to kidney failure, requiring dialysis three times a week. He advised the relative to sell a piece of ancestral land that generated no cash flow and invest the funds into Taiwan&rsquo;s high-dividend ETF 0056. This would generate nearly 600,000 TWD in annual cash flow (50,000 TWD per month), completely solving her living expenses and allowing her to live with more dignity. He believes that the form of an asset can be changed; converting land into a stock asset that continuously generates cash flow can also be passed down to future generations.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: There is much suffering in the world, but the number of people we can help is limited. You gave excellent advice, but if she is unwilling to sell the land, that is her choice. We can only help those who are willing to be helped. At the same time, he also reminded everyone to protect their kidney health, drink more water, and stay away from junk food and sugary drinks.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>You think what you&rsquo;re doing is moving you towards your goal, but in reality, you&rsquo;re just moving further away from it, and you still think you&rsquo;re heading towards your goal. This is the most frightening thing.
&ndash; Lin</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote profoundly points out the disconnect between the actions and goals of many investors. They engage in speculative, trend-chasing, and other entertainment-like operations, yet expect to achieve long-term, stable financial objectives. Ultimately, they often end up going in the opposite direction, wasting precious time and capital.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stocks are assets&hellip; How much they sell for is determined by you, the asset owner&hellip; As long as you sell (QQQ), you are wrong. Selling at any time is wrong because you are selling too low.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to concerns about inflation, Teacher James emphasized the nature of quality stocks as real assets. Their long-term value will continuously grow, and short-term price fluctuations should not affect the determination to hold. Selling quality assets is equivalent to giving away huge future potential at a low price.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can&rsquo;t save the poor&hellip; 99.99% of people are fated to be poor, it can&rsquo;t be helped. So you should just&hellip; let go.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>While this statement may sound blunt, it reflects a reality in investment education: we can only influence those who are willing to accept and change. For family or friends who are stubborn and dominated by fear, it is better to let go and focus on one&rsquo;s own growth than to persuade them in vain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When people get old, if you don&rsquo;t have money, others might see you as a kind of &rsquo;lower-class elderly&rsquo;.
&ndash; Haoqing</p></blockquote>
<p>This point raised by Haoqing in his sharing very realistically highlights the importance of financial independence in old age. Having a stable cash flow is not just for survival, but for maintaining dignity, avoiding dependency on others, and being at their mercy in one&rsquo;s later years.</p>

<p>This session provided a significant optimization to the smart rebalancing strategy from a more refined and secure perspective, introducing the concept of &ldquo;Flexible Rebalancing.&rdquo; The core idea is to protect cash as a lifeline, preferring to exchange underlying assets for leveraged assets rather than easily tapping into cash reserves when they are insufficient. At the same time, the course demonstrated strong practicality by offering concrete and viable solutions, such as allocating to high-dividend products like JEPQ, for groups facing real-life difficulties (like insufficient retirement funds). Overall, this session not only deepened the theory of asset allocation but also closely integrated the practical financial needs of different life stages, once again emphasizing the core investment principles of long-term holding, risk control, and cash is king.</p>

      <description>In this session, Teacher James elaborates on the core strategies of asset allocation and withdrawal rates for those who are retired or nearing retirement, emphasizing that &amp;#39;survival&amp;#39; is more important than chasing high returns. The content covers portfolio construction with different cash ratios (30%, 40%, 50%), maximum Beta value limits, and corresponding safe withdrawal rates. It also delves into topics like stock pledging, investment mindset, and the outlook for the AI era. The student sharing segment is rich with content, ranging from the joy of financial growth through practice to discussions on specific financial decisions (like buying a car or investing with a loan).</description>

<p>The core theme of this session is <strong>constructing a robust asset allocation strategy for retired or near-retired individuals with &lsquo;survival&rsquo; as the primary goal</strong>. The central idea is that financial planning in retirement should prioritize the stability and longevity of cash flow over maximizing investment returns. Teacher James explains in detail how to set the portfolio&rsquo;s risk exposure (Beta value) based on different levels of cash reserves (30%, 40%, 50%) and, accordingly, determine a safe annual withdrawal rate. The aim is to ensure one can weather even extreme market conditions, such as a 15-year-long bear market.</p>

<li><strong>Beware of Scams</strong>: Recent online scams remain rampant, such as videos using AI to imitate the voices of figures like Jensen Huang, luring users into groups with offers of free books or ChatGPT tutorials for fraudulent purposes. Teacher James shared that even his own father received a scam text message claiming his &ldquo;phone had been hacked,&rdquo; reminding everyone not to click on unknown links. Important institutions like the government and banks typically communicate via mail rather than phone calls.</li>
<li><strong>Identifying Fake Accounts</strong>: After recommending &ldquo;阿良正传的人生&rdquo; (A-Liang&rsquo;s True Story of Life) last week, some students mistakenly followed a fake Facebook account set up by scammers.

<p>Teacher James proposed three cash-based asset allocation models for retirees with different financial situations and risk tolerances:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>30% Cash Allocation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highest Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 1.0)</strong>: The remaining 70% of assets can be allocated as 40% in an index fund (like QQQ) and 30% in a leveraged fund (like TQQQ).</li>
<li><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate</strong>: With this allocation, a maximum of <strong>2%</strong> of total assets can be withdrawn annually for living expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.7)</strong>: If the portfolio consists of 70% in an index fund with no leverage, the withdrawal rate can be increased to <strong>3%</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: The higher the asset volatility, the lower the withdrawal rate must be to prevent excessive asset depletion during a market downturn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>40% Cash Allocation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.9)</strong>: The remaining 60% of assets can be allocated with a maximum of 30% in an index fund and 30% in a leveraged fund.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate</strong>: With this allocation, a maximum of <strong>3%</strong> can be withdrawn annually.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.6)</strong>: If the portfolio is 40% index and 20% leveraged, the withdrawal rate can be increased to <strong>4%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>50% Cash Allocation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Risk Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.7)</strong>: The remaining 50% of assets can be allocated with a maximum of 30% in an index fund and 20% in a leveraged fund.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate</strong>: With this allocation, <strong>4%</strong> can be withdrawn annually.</li>
<li><strong>No-Leverage Allocation (Beta ≈ 0.5)</strong>: If the allocation is 50% cash and 50% index fund, the withdrawal rate can be increased to <strong>5%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ultimate Goal: 15 Years of Cash Reserves</strong>
<ul>
<li>The most ideal state is to hold enough cash at a market high to cover living expenses for the next 15 years. Considering that cash itself earns interest (e.g., 3.5%), one might only need to prepare 12-13 years&rsquo; worth of principal to last for 15 years.</li>
<li>If this cannot be achieved initially, cash can be gradually accumulated through rebalancing when the market goes up until the 15-year goal is met or exceeded.</li>
<li>Only when cash reserves exceed 15 years of living expenses can the surplus be used to buy the dip during a market downturn, ensuring that &ldquo;survival&rdquo; remains the top priority.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investing is Learned, Not Taught</strong>: James quotes the concept of &ldquo;The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao,&rdquo; emphasizing that investment philosophy must be personally contemplated, understood, and practiced to be truly internalized. Like riding a bicycle, no amount of reading can replace getting on the bike and trying. He encourages everyone to use their hands and minds to explore and comprehend for themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Rethinking Stock Pledging</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Evolution of Concept</strong>: In the past, to avoid sacrificing returns by holding cash (used for pledging), it was recommended to pair it with leveraged funds. Now, the emphasis is more on &ldquo;stability&rdquo; and &ldquo;survival.&rdquo; Therefore, even without chasing the highest returns, a no-leverage portfolio of 50% cash and 50% index fund can still be used for a pledged-asset line of credit.</li>
<li><strong>Pledging Risk Warning</strong>: The teacher used an example to explain why even a seemingly low borrowing ratio (e.g., 10%) could lead to bankruptcy. Suppose you borrow $100,000 against $1 million in assets. During a prolonged bear market of 10 years (like 2000-2009, when the market fell 85%), the $100,000 loan plus interest could grow to $160,000, while your assets might shrink to just $150,000, at which point you would be insolvent. This highlights the importance of holding sufficient cash (e.g., 30%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow is the Lifeline</strong>: An anecdote about an individual with over 100 million TWD in assets who fell into a cash flow crisis after buying a 75 million TWD mansion serves as a warning that regardless of asset size, a lack of cash flow management can lead to bankruptcy risk.</li>

<li><strong>Seize the Opportunity, Hold on Tight</strong>: Those who follow the trend have the chance to &ldquo;go to space,&rdquo; but without adhering to correct investment principles and learning to think, they could also fall from space.

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: She started listening to the teacher&rsquo;s classes in April 2021. Although she&rsquo;s a slow learner, she has saved $100,000 in the past 20 months despite a modest salary, which makes her very surprised and happy. She has already reduced her portfolio&rsquo;s Beta from 1.3 to around 1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Her car is in poor condition. Should she spend $1,000 to fix it and drive for a few more years, or buy a Tesla to improve her quality of life? Although she&rsquo;s tempted, she feels she is still in the early stages of wealth accumulation.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: He advises spending the $1,000 to fix the car. Since her total assets are not yet substantial, buying a fifty or sixty-thousand-dollar car would be too high a percentage of her total assets. At this stage, she should continue to invest her funds. The teacher suggests she cleverly use credit cards, such as an Apple Card or American Express with 2%-3% cash back, and invest all the rewards into TQQQ, thereby &ldquo;getting richer as you spend.&rdquo; At the same time, he shared a personal regret. Due to his frugality, when he took his mother to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, she hesitated to take more dishes to be considerate of him, a memory that he later deeply regretted. Therefore, while buying a car is not recommended, one should not be overly frugal on crucial matters like showing filial piety to parents.</li>

<li>She shared a personal insight, viewing the wealth growth in her account as &ldquo;a grace from heaven and the teacher&rsquo;s enlightenment.&rdquo; Because this money was &ldquo;originally nothing,&rdquo; her heart is filled with gratitude.</li>
<li>During the recent floods in Hualien, her family suggested making a donation. She sold a portion of her gains from 00670L (a 2x leveraged ETF) to donate, which she calls &ldquo;charitable rebalancing.&rdquo; She felt very happy donating it because the money was never &ldquo;hers&rdquo; to begin with. She has taken on a leadership role in a local charity and believes the money for charity doesn&rsquo;t come &ldquo;from her pocket&rdquo; but is obtained through investment wisdom, which can then be naturally given back to society.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: After listening to a Buddhist dharma talk, she associated Teacher James&rsquo;s teachings with helping people &ldquo;escape the cycle of poverty,&rdquo; which filled her with a &ldquo;mind of reverence.&rdquo; She shared her recent action: she resolutely terminated a losing insurance policy, got back $24,000, and immediately invested it using the teacher&rsquo;s method. She believes that although it&rsquo;s a short-term loss, it&rsquo;s more important to cut losses in time and get on the right &ldquo;elevator,&rdquo; as she can earn it back in the coming years. She also began to ponder the deeper meaning of the teacher&rsquo;s emphasis on &ldquo;reserving 15 years of cash,&rdquo; understanding it&rsquo;s to ensure that one can both live without worry and navigate through a long bear market via rebalancing.</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: He explained the &ldquo;15 years of cash&rdquo; concept in detail. It is mainly for retired individuals with no source of income. The calculation is: annual expenses minus fixed income (like social security), then multiply the amount you need to cover by 15. For example, if you need to provide $50,000 yourself annually, you need to prepare $750,000 in cash. This standard is based on the historical experience of 2000-2015, where the market might have taken 15 years to return to its high. For those still working, they can dynamically replenish cash with their monthly salary and don&rsquo;t need to strictly sell stocks for rebalancing.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is a &ldquo;veteran student&rdquo; who has been following the teacher since 2011. He believes that new students today are very fortunate because the teacher&rsquo;s current investment strategy (indexing, long-term holding, automation) has evolved to its &ldquo;most perfect moment.&rdquo; He recalled that in the early years, the teacher&rsquo;s methods included individual stock picking and active trading. While it was possible to avoid major crashes, it was difficult for ordinary people to follow, and the after-tax returns were not ideal. Many old students missed out on the later, more optimized strategies because they didn&rsquo;t continue learning. He himself, based on the teacher&rsquo;s latest retirement calculation method in late 2023, found that he had enough to retire. He officially retired in January 2024 and now lives a wonderful life, with his investment income even exceeding his previous salary.</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: He thanked Dr. An for his sharing. He compared his early investment teaching to an &ldquo;expeditionary force,&rdquo; with heavy casualties and few who could keep up. Now, because online teaching doesn&rsquo;t allow for real-time command of tens of thousands of students, the strategy had to evolve into a &ldquo;space force&rdquo;—a fully automated model with no manual intervention. The pandemic accelerated this transformation. He praised Dr. An for not only keeping up but also implementing advanced operations like stock pledging and Roth conversions.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is a 36-year-old junior manager who started following the teacher during the market crash in 2022. His assets have since doubled. He calculated that he could reach his retirement threshold around age 45, but he is currently under a lot of work pressure and wants to accelerate his retirement.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: With this conflicting mindset of &ldquo;wanting to accelerate&rdquo; yet knowing &ldquo;safety comes first,&rdquo; how should he adjust his asset allocation and mentality?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Since he is nearly 10 years away from retirement, he can absolutely adopt a more aggressive strategy. He can maintain a Beta of 1.0 and &ldquo;not rebalance&rdquo; for the next few years, letting his profits run. This might naturally increase his Beta to 1.3 or even 1.5. When he is about 5 years from retirement, he can start &ldquo;hitting the brakes&rdquo; by gradually increasing his cash position and reducing risk.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: At the age of 30-something, how can one better &ldquo;exchange money for spiritual energy&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The core of spiritual energy is &ldquo;vision&rdquo; and &ldquo;capacity of mind.&rdquo; You should practice a mindset: imagine you suddenly have 20 billion. If your lifestyle and mentality remain unchanged, then your spiritual energy is strong enough. True financial freedom is when &ldquo;money&rdquo; disappears from your life. It becomes like air, natural. When you consume, you no longer consider the price, only the value and experience. This is what frees you from trivial matters, allowing your spiritual energy to grow stronger.</li>

<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This idea is completely correct and is an excellent method of dynamic adjustment.

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He is a new student who just found the channel two weeks ago and lost sleep for a few days due to the sheer volume of information. His previous belief was to hold VT and 0050 long-term and sell assets to live on in retirement. He only understood the groundbreaking concept of &ldquo;stock pledging&rdquo; after encountering the teacher.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>:
<ol>
<li>If, after retiring and starting to withdraw via pledging for 3 years, his cash reserves reach the 15-year level, does he need to prepare 18 years of cash to be safe, considering the 3 years of living expenses already borrowed?</li>
<li>When the teacher retired at 42, did he already have the concept of living off a pledged-asset line of credit? What was the inspiration for this idea?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>No, it&rsquo;s not necessary. Because after a few years of market growth, your total asset size will be much larger than at the beginning. The growth in assets will be more than enough to cover the borrowed portion, making your safety cushion even thicker.</li>
<li>It was an evolutionary process. He didn&rsquo;t know about it when he retired; he discovered it later. In 2018, he needed money but didn&rsquo;t want to sell stocks and pay high taxes, so he proactively emailed his brokerage to ask if he could borrow against his stocks. The brokerage immediately set up a pledged-asset loan for him. He pointed out that this is a &ldquo;secret&rdquo; of the financial industry because regulations restrict brokerages from proactively marketing such banking services to clients unless the client asks first.</li>

Stablecoin increases the efficiency of this &ldquo;aggression&rdquo; by at least 10 times because it can bypass central banks and the SWIFT system, penetrating directly into the general populace. This will cause more countries to lose their monetary sovereignty. The significant increase in the circulation of the US dollar will bring enormous interest income to US financial institutions.

<li>If you still have income, use the income to maintain the ratio. If you are fully retired, simply withdraw one year&rsquo;s living expenses from the cash portion annually. If the market goes up, let your cash reserves naturally grow to, say, 20 years. When the market falls, use the portion above your 15-16 year baseline to buy stocks.</li>

<li><strong>Son</strong>: Just started working with a stable income. All spare cash should go into 00662. There is no need to hold cash at this stage.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>For retirement, what matters is cash flow, not rate of return. Return is secondary; survival is the most important thing.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This viewpoint was a common thread throughout the session and is the cornerstone of this asset allocation strategy, reminding retirees to place financial security above return growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. &hellip; The true Tao is the one you comprehend for yourself. Everything spoken is just the surface, the written words of a martial arts manual.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher emphasizes the importance of independent thinking and personal practice in investing. Knowledge must be internalized to become true wisdom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A peanut for your parents while they&rsquo;re alive is worth more than a whole pig on the altar after they&rsquo;re gone. (Taiwanese proverb)
&ndash; Teacher James (Quoted by Jenny during her sharing)</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher uses this vivid metaphor to stress that filial piety and care should be expressed while loved ones are still alive; their value far exceeds lavish memorials after they have passed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don&rsquo;t reduce volatility by changing your investment vehicle; you reduce volatility by holding cash. Low long-term return is the real risk.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>A concise point made by the teacher when answering his daughter&rsquo;s question, pointing out that the correct way to handle market volatility is to adjust the cash ratio, not to sacrifice long-term returns by choosing a less volatile asset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to first tell yourself that he is right, and I am wrong. &hellip; Why would someone who is wrong be so loud? This will make you reflect.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher&rsquo;s method for practicing patience, shared when answering how to maintain it. By first acknowledging the other person&rsquo;s validity, one can effectively de-escalate one&rsquo;s own emotions and achieve more peaceful communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never pay back borrowed money. This is very important. If you intend to pay back the money from a pledged-asset line, you shouldn&rsquo;t have borrowed it in the first place.
&ndash; Benson &amp; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Benson&rsquo;s sharing and the teacher&rsquo;s confirmation highlight the core essence of stock pledging: the borrowed money is a tool for living expenses or reinvestment. The goal is to ensure the cash-flow-generating asset is never depleted, thus &ldquo;repaying the principal&rdquo; is an incorrect operation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When investing doesn&rsquo;t exist, the market doesn&rsquo;t exist, and money doesn&rsquo;t exist, that&rsquo;s when your spiritual energy is at its peak.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>The teacher describes the highest state of financial freedom. When wealth is so abundant that one no longer needs to think or worry about money itself, one can attain true spiritual freedom.</p>

</h2>
<p>This session was an extremely profound and practical lesson on retirement financial planning. Teacher James has evolved from his previous focus on &ldquo;the highest return under safe conditions&rdquo; to a more conservative strategy centered on &ldquo;absolute safety,&rdquo; providing a clear and actionable guide to asset allocation and withdrawal rates for those approaching or in retirement. Through the detailed breakdown of the 30%, 40%, and 50% cash allocation models, individuals in different financial situations can find a suitable &ldquo;survival&rdquo; plan. The numerous student sharings in the Q&amp;A session, from the &ldquo;then and now&rdquo; comparisons of veteran students to the &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moments and practical applications of new students, vividly demonstrated how this investment philosophy can change the financial destinies and life outlooks of different people. The entire session was not just a transmission of investment techniques but a deep exchange on views about wealth, risk, and life wisdom.</p>
