<p>Real estate prices have a long-term upward trend.  Numerous research institutions in Taiwan have shown that the average annual return on real estate investment in Taiwan is around 22% to 25% or more, the highest among all investment tools. According to reports, real estate prices in Taipei&rsquo;s Songshan and Xinyi districts have increased by as much as nine times in 10 years, translating to an average annual return of about 23%.</p>
<p><strong>The Rise of Land Prices: There&rsquo;s a Reason</strong></p>
<p>In the long run, there are three main reasons why real estate prices rise and offer high returns:</p>
<p><strong>First, the supply of land is limited.</strong> Land is inherently scarce, and Taiwan, being an island, has limited land resources. With continuous development, the available land for construction is dwindling. Moreover, land cannot be imported, so the supply is decreasing rather than increasing, and this problem will become increasingly severe. Therefore, real estate prices are bound to increase year by year.</p>
<p><strong>Second, demand continues to grow.</strong> Real estate can be generally divided into commercial and residential uses.  Commercial real estate (such as shops and factories) can be considered a means of production.  When a company&rsquo;s profitability increases, it is willing to pay higher rent, which drives up the price of the property. As the company grows, its space requirements also increase annually.</p>
<p>For personal and family use, as the economy grows and incomes rise, the demand for living space and quality also increases. In the past, a family of seven, eight, or even more than ten people would be content to squeeze into a 70-100 square foot apartment. Now, with increased income, an average family of four needs a 130-165 square foot apartment or larger to be satisfied.</p>
<p>A survey released in May 1996 showed that the homeownership rate in Taiwan was as high as 80%, but most were mixed-use properties with generally poor living quality, especially in metropolitan areas where the proportion of privately owned parking spaces was low. Despite the shrinking family size and high housing prices, the average living space per household has increased. In 1995, the average living space per household was 109 square feet, an increase of 20 square feet compared to 1990.  As we move towards an information-based society, activities like working from home, online shopping, and banking from home will increase, further raising the demand for higher quality living spaces. Perhaps in 10 years, a 330 square foot apartment will no longer be sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>Third, inflation.</strong> Real estate not only satisfies the need for housing but also serves as a hedge against inflation.  Inflation drives up the prices of tangible assets (like real estate) while devaluing intangible assets (like cash).  The reason why real estate prices rise with inflation is simple: its costs, including land acquisition, building materials, and labor, are constantly increasing. These costs are inevitably reflected in the price of the property, and with sustained demand, real estate prices are bound to rise continuously.</p>
<p>Therefore, the faster a country&rsquo;s corporate profits increase (higher economic growth rate) and the faster national income rises, the faster real estate rents and prices will increase in the long run. Short-term real estate prices may not rise in tandem, but in the long term, prices will naturally reflect demand, and the average return on investment will be considerable.</p>
<p><strong>Can Real Estate Maintain High Returns in the Future?</strong></p>
<p>Investors often question: &ldquo;Real estate has indeed created many wealthy individuals in the past, but will it continue to rise in the future? The average annual return on real estate investment in the past was over 20%, mainly due to Taiwan&rsquo;s rapid economic growth. Can Taiwan&rsquo;s real estate maintain this high growth rate in the future?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taiwan&rsquo;s economy has transitioned from a period of rapid growth to a more stable growth phase. The average annual economic growth rate has decreased from around 9% over a decade ago to around 6% in recent years. Although economic growth has slowed significantly compared to the past, Taiwan still ranks among the top 10 globally in terms of economic growth. This is advantageous for real estate investment.</p>
<p>Moreover, due to continuous population growth, Taiwan has a population density of 534 people per square kilometer, the second-highest in the world, making land even more valuable.  The high savings rate among ordinary people and limited investment options mean that real estate and stocks are the primary investment channels for most. However, due to the volatility of stock prices, many prefer investing in real estate.  The common belief is that leaving land or a house to the next generation provides a foundation for their future.  Therefore, with limited supply and continuously increasing demand, real estate should still maintain a return rate of 15% to 20%.  Furthermore, the government&rsquo;s gradual relaxation of restrictions on foreign investment in Taiwan&rsquo;s real estate market will further increase demand, leading to even better market performance.</p>
<p>Taiwan has experienced multiple cycles of economic growth and recession, and real estate prices have gone through periods of rapid increases and long-term consolidation.  Many investors questioned whether Taiwan&rsquo;s housing prices would continue to rise. Especially during periods of domestic and cross-strait instability, many believed that Taiwan&rsquo;s real estate market would collapse, leading them to sell their properties. Now, they regret their decisions. <strong>Facts have proven that as long as demand continues to grow and exceeds supply, prices will inevitably rise. This is an undeniable economic law. The cycle of &ldquo;prices rise for a long time, then consolidate, then rise again&rdquo; will continue to occur.</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, whether in the past, present, or future, real estate remains an indispensable investment tool for individuals, families, and businesses.</p>

</h3>
<p>Hong Kong real estate tycoon Lee Shau Kee was ranked the richest Chinese in the world by Forbes magazine in 1996, with a net worth of US$12.7 billion, making him the fourth richest person globally. He ranked ahead of Taiwan&rsquo;s richest man, Tsai Wan-lin, the fifth richest globally, and Li Ka-shing, the sixth richest and long-time wealthiest man in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Lee Shau Kee is not well-known in Taiwan. Now 68 years old, he is the chairman of Henderson Land Development and Hong Kong and China Gas Company. His wealth primarily comes from Henderson Land, the second-largest listed company in Hong Kong in 1996, with a market capitalization of over NT$350 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Acquiring and Redeveloping Old Buildings at Low Prices</strong></p>
<p>After moving from Guangzhou to Hong Kong in 1948, Lee Shau Kee started in real estate sales, specializing in acquiring small plots of land, redeveloping them, and selling them using a then-novel sales method: &ldquo;Stratified sales with ten-year installment payments.&rdquo;  This proved highly successful, making him famous.  In 1976, he founded Henderson Land Development, focusing on real estate development, rebuilding old buildings, and developing small and medium-sized residential properties.  By 1988, the company had expanded considerably, and Lee focused on real estate investment.</p>
<p>Lee Shau Kee&rsquo;s unique skill lies in persuading owners of old buildings in bustling areas to sell their properties, acquiring them at low prices, demolishing them, and then rebuilding.  Henderson Land&rsquo;s vast land holdings also include farmland acquired from farmers in the early days and properties bought from overseas Chinese through advertisements in Chinese newspapers in the US and Canada.</p>
<p>He believes the best real estate investment strategy is to choose the right location, focusing on densely populated areas with convenient transportation.  Whether it&rsquo;s stratified sales or renting for personal use, such locations offer excellent returns on investment.  He emphasizes that choosing an investment location requires the ability to turn one dollar into three.</p>
<p><strong>Prosperity Comes From Land Ownership</strong></p>
<p>After years of research, the author has found that today&rsquo;s wealthy individuals primarily accumulate their wealth through three avenues: inheritance, entrepreneurship, or investment.  <strong>Among those who achieve wealth through investment, a vast majority do so through real estate.</strong></p>
<p>Indeed, most wealthy individuals have made their fortunes in real estate.  In 1996, half of the world&rsquo;s top ten richest individuals derived their wealth from land, including Hong Kong&rsquo;s Lee Shau Kee, Li Ka-shing, Taiwan&rsquo;s Tsai Wan-lin, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi of Japan&rsquo;s Seibu Railway Group (ranked seventh globally), and Cheng Chou-ming (ranked tenth globally).</p>
<p>According to the 1996 Forbes Rich List, 179 individuals involved in real estate controlled approximately US$257.2 billion in wealth, accounting for 64% of the total wealth on the list.  This demonstrates that &ldquo;prosperity comes from land ownership&rdquo; is a timeless principle. This phenomenon is most pronounced in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan, where land is scarce and appreciation potential is high.  Hong Kong&rsquo;s top three richest individuals, Lee Shau Kee, Li Ka-shing, and Raymond Kwok of Sun Hung Kai Properties, all made their fortunes in real estate. Taiwan is no exception.  Besides Tsai Wan-lin, prominent tycoons like Lin Rong-san, Lin Yu-lin, and Lin Hsieh-chen also built their empires on real estate. Most listed companies in Taiwan and Hong Kong are related to real estate.  Even if their core business is not real estate, they have real estate investments. Companies like Yulon Motor, Shin Kong Life Insurance, Fubon Insurance, Chinatrust, and Yuanta Securities all derive significant income from real estate.</p>
<p>Tsai Wan-tsai, chairman of Fubon Group and one of Taiwan&rsquo;s top ten richest individuals, primarily built his wealth through insurance, but stocks and real estate remain key investment tools. Tsai owns land in many bustling areas of Taipei, including a large plot near Nanyang Street, currently under development, and the newly opened Fubon Financial Center on Ren&rsquo;ai Road, which he purchased in 1986 for over NT$1 billion. The 12,000 square foot property is now worth NT$4 billion.  The 5,000 square foot Fubon Bank on Minsheng East Road, purchased in 1996 for NT$400,000 per ping (36 square feet), has now doubled in value.  &ldquo;Real estate makes money faster,&rdquo; says Tsai Wan-tsai, who spends his free time looking for and buying land whenever he has the funds.</p>
<p>These examples demonstrate that for those seeking wealth through investment, real estate is an essential component of their portfolio, and should even be the primary focus.  The success of financial management often depends on real estate ownership. Therefore, readers with sufficient funds should prioritize purchasing a home for personal use. Those with insufficient funds should consider leveraged investing to achieve homeownership and potentially higher returns. It&rsquo;s worth reiterating: &ldquo;Prosperity comes from land ownership.&rdquo; Throughout history and across the globe, the vast majority of those who have achieved financial success have done so through real estate.</p>
<p>From many perspectives, real estate is a better investment than stocks. While stocks can be a good investment, their prices fluctuate significantly. Listed stocks are traded centrally on exchanges with transparent pricing, leading to daily ups and downs that can be nerve-wracking for investors, especially when prices drop immediately after purchase.  Holding stocks requires enduring the shock of substantial price swings, bringing joy during rises and pain during falls. Unfortunately, stock prices inevitably fluctuate.</p>
<p>Some people experience pain regardless of whether prices rise or fall.  During downturns, they regret their initial investment and don&rsquo;t buy more at lower prices. During upturns, they regret not buying more initially.  Their emotions are constantly affected by price movements.  Real estate investment, on the other hand, doesn&rsquo;t have these problems. Even if real estate prices fluctuate daily, it&rsquo;s not readily apparent, allowing for a &ldquo;buy and hold&rdquo; strategy and enjoying the benefits of economic growth.</p>

<p>Tsai Wan-lin, Honorary Chairman of Cathay Life Insurance, is one of Taiwan&rsquo;s richest individuals and among the top ten wealthiest globally, with a fortune of NT$180 billion.  Despite his ordinary appearance and lack of exceptional academic credentials, how did Tsai Wan-lin build such a vast empire and create an extraordinary life? Where did his wealth come from?  It&rsquo;s widely known that he owns a &ldquo;golden goose&rdquo; company—Cathay Life Insurance—the largest listed company in Taiwan by market capitalization. With over NT$500 billion in available funds for investment in real estate, securities, and loans, Cathay Life&rsquo;s assets have grown rapidly, allowing Tsai Wan-lin&rsquo;s wealth to snowball.</p>
<p><strong>Buy Land, Rent, Don&rsquo;t Sell</strong></p>
<p>Tsai Wan-lin&rsquo;s secret to wealth lies in familiar investment tools: stocks and real estate.  He keeps nearly 50% of the shares of his wealth-generating companies, Cathay Life Insurance and Cathay Real Estate Development, locked away, allowing them to appreciate naturally.  Stocks have become his &ldquo;real estate.&rdquo; How did he turn actual real estate into a gold mine?</p>
<p>Tsai Wan-lin consistently invested his money in real estate and adopted a &ldquo;buy-to-rent&rdquo; strategy.  Now in his 70s and semi-retired, he continues to look for and buy land, his lifelong passion.  According to his third son, Tsai Chen-yu, Chairman of First Commercial Bank: &ldquo;We mostly choose corner lots because they offer larger buildable areas and are lively. We moved to Ren&rsquo;ai Road Section 4 in 1961.  Back then, it was all shooting ranges and military factories, and there was no Fudan Bridge. Looking from Ximending, the East District was the edge of development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the past in Taiwan, land near mountains or at the edge of development would inevitably appreciate. Sure enough, in recent years, development has extended beyond the mountains to Xizhi and Nangang, so the suburban land we bought has now become prime real estate.  Our land acquisition strategy has remained consistent over the years, and now our focus has shifted to Xizhi and Tucheng, buying large tracts of suburban land for gradual development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elaborating on Tsai Wan-lin&rsquo;s philosophy of leasing rather than selling real estate, he added: &ldquo;Real estate is called &lsquo;immovable property&rsquo; because you shouldn&rsquo;t move it. If you sell in the short term, you&rsquo;ll only make a 10% or 20% profit.  Hold it for the long term, and after decades, it becomes many times its original value.  <strong>Therefore, the highest level of real estate investment is renting, not buying and selling.</strong>&rdquo; Tsai Chen-yu, who studied in Japan, cites Japanese century-old businesses as examples.  He observed that the success of Mitsubishi Estate and Mitsui Fudosan lies in owning real estate and holding onto it. More than 65% of their operating income comes from rental income.</p>
<p>Because Tsai Wan-lin acquired his land at very low costs, he then had Cathay Real Estate Development develop it and lease it to Cathay Life Insurance, creating a stable stream of rental income and land appreciation.  Cathay Life Insurance invests billions of dollars in buying and selling real estate annually.  Since they buy much more than they sell, they now own over 180 buildings throughout Taiwan. In short, Tsai Wan-lin&rsquo;s secret to wealth lies in holding onto real estate for the long term.</p>
<p><strong>Real Estate and Stock Investment Strategies Are Similar</strong></p>
<p>The strategies mentioned above for stock investment also apply to real estate investment. From an investment perspective, &ldquo;buy anything, buy anytime, don&rsquo;t sell&rdquo; is also an excellent strategy for real estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy anything&rdquo; emphasizes that selecting investment targets isn&rsquo;t as difficult as it seems.  It&rsquo;s not necessary to have predictive abilities or advanced analytical skills.  Diversification is key.  The impact of individual investments isn&rsquo;t that significant, so buying anything can work. However, because real estate investments are larger, diversification is harder to achieve. Also, purchasing real estate often involves multiple considerations, limiting the applicability of this &ldquo;buy anything&rdquo; approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy anytime&rdquo; means investing in real estate whenever you have money, without waiting for the perfect timing, because you can never predict the market perfectly.  For most people, &ldquo;buy anytime&rdquo; seems unrealistic given the high cost of real estate.  Being able to buy one house in a lifetime is already considered a significant achievement.  Real estate isn&rsquo;t like stocks, which can be bought in smaller amounts anytime.  However, don&rsquo;t underestimate yourself.  Invest small amounts in stocks regularly, and when you&rsquo;ve saved enough, consider leveraged investment.  By following the investment principles in this book, buying three or four houses in a lifetime is achievable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sell&rdquo; is difficult to achieve with stocks, but easier with real estate because price fluctuations are less visible and less likely to influence decisions. Many &ldquo;land rich&rdquo; individuals became wealthy by adhering to this principle.  Real estate is also known as &ldquo;immovable property.&rdquo;  If you can adopt a mindset of &ldquo;own the property, ignore the price,&rdquo; buying and holding long-term will naturally yield high returns.  Moreover, transaction costs for real estate are higher than for stocks, including taxes like land value increment tax, capital gains tax, and deed tax.  If you use an agent, you&rsquo;ll incur additional fees, making the overall transaction costs quite high.</p>
<p>For real estate investment, value investing, growth investing, and contrarian investing are even better strategies than &ldquo;buy anything, buy anytime, don&rsquo;t sell.&rdquo;  Value investing involves buying when the intrinsic value of the property exceeds its price.  As mentioned earlier, value is difficult to measure precisely for real estate, relying on subjective judgment, though market trends can provide guidance. For instance, if real estate prices decline significantly, the intrinsic value likely exceeds the market price, creating a good buying opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing the Right Location is Crucial</strong></p>
<p>Contrarian investing in real estate means selecting locations that others are currently overlooking but have future growth potential. If these areas develop as anticipated, the initial low purchase price will generate substantial profits.  Avoid buying when everyone else is rushing into the market, as prices are likely inflated. Conversely, when everyone believes prices will continue to fall and market activity is low, it might be the best time to invest.</p>
<p>Growth investing is perhaps the most important and easiest of the three strategies for real estate. The three secrets to real estate investment are location, location, location.  <strong>The key is to consider the future growth potential of the location. Don&rsquo;t choose the cheapest or currently best areas, but those with future development prospects.</strong></p>
<p>How do you choose a good location?  It requires some imagination.  Real estate development is like a ripple effect from a stone thrown into a calm lake.  Initially, development centers around the city center, but the surrounding areas become the fastest-growing and most promising investment targets.  Growth investors can sell their properties in the city center at high prices and reinvest in cheaper outlying areas to enjoy significant future appreciation. In Taipei, the best investment location 20 years ago was Ximending. Now it&rsquo;s the Eastern District, and future development will likely focus on suburban areas like Xizhi and Tucheng.  Those looking to buy real estate should explore the outskirts, envisioning future development directions.</p>
<p><strong>Buy Now, Hold Long-Term: The Best Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Real estate is a cyclical industry with predictable price patterns.  Short-term price fluctuations are inevitable, but in the long run, prices tend to rise.  The characteristic pattern is a long period of rising prices followed by consolidation, then another period of rising prices.  Real estate also exhibits a common market characteristic: the faster prices rise, the faster demand increases.</p>
<p>Historically, Taiwan&rsquo;s real estate market cycles have lasted between three and nine years, averaging seven years.  One characteristic of rising prices is a substantial increase of two to four times at the beginning of each cycle, followed by years of consolidation. Some hope to buy at the very beginning of a price increase, but no one can accurately predict the exact starting point.  By the time you realize prices are rising, they&rsquo;ve already increased substantially, and by the time you place an order, the price might be double or even more.  Since no one can predict the start of a price increase, the smartest and best approach is to act promptly, buy property, and hold it long-term for substantial profits.</p>
<p>Generally, there are several signs of an impending price increase: rising stock prices, favorable government policies, and the central bank lowering interest rates to loosen monetary policy. Stock prices are a good predictor of economic activity.  Rising stock prices increase available funds, which often fuels real estate price increases.</p>
<p>Real estate is a &ldquo;locomotive&rdquo; industry.  To stimulate an economy, it&rsquo;s essential to stimulate real estate prices.  When the government injects capital into the market and lowers interest rates to boost the economy, it often presents an excellent opportunity to invest in both real estate and stocks.</p>

</h3>
<p>Cheng Chou-ming, the richest man in the Philippines, has seen his wealth surge due to the recent boom in the Philippine real estate market. In 1996, Forbes estimated his net worth at US$7 billion, placing him among the world&rsquo;s top ten richest individuals.  His secret to success lies in stocks and real estate, and his investment strategy involves contrarian investing: buying the best assets at the lowest prices during times of low market confidence and holding them long-term.</p>
<p>Cheng Chou-ming owns land in Taiwan, the Philippines, mainland China, and Houston, Texas.  His holdings include 32 plots of land in Taiwan totaling 135 acres and 362 plots in the Philippines exceeding 50,000 acres, where he is currently building skyscrapers.  He also has a large-scale project on Fuga Island in the northern Philippines, a 250,000-acre island larger than Hong Kong by one-third, where he plans to build a free port with docks, an airport, and hotels.</p>
<p><strong>Patience and Endurance Yield Hundredfold Returns</strong></p>
<p>Cheng Chou-ming, a keen real estate investor, bought large tracts of land in the Philippines 20 years ago for NT$0.2 per ping, which has now appreciated to over NT$600.  This is his philosophy of &ldquo;endurance,&rdquo; patiently waiting 20 years for a two- to three-thousandfold return. Cheng Chou-ming says: &ldquo;There are four types of people in real estate development: land investors, land developers, constructors, and builders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land investment takes longer, so land investors generally make larger profits, while the latter three, with shorter investment horizons, earn smaller margins, often just making money from developing the land. Land investment requires initial capital and a keen eye for location selection.  Entering the market at the right time allows you to acquire land cheaply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Future purchases of new land and interest payments on existing land can be covered by selling a small portion of the existing holdings.  For example, selling one plot of land for the Asiaworld Group currently covers the acquisition cost of all our land.  So, with patience and endurance, future returns can be hundreds or even thousands of times the initial investment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, Cheng Chou-ming acquired the current site of the Grand Hyatt Taipei on Nanjing East Road for a very low price. While others were selling their properties and preparing to emigrate, Cheng Chou-ming decisively purchased this overgrown and neglected land, which became his base for future development in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Cheng Chou-ming excels at recognizing that the worst of times offer the best opportunities.  During the cross-strait crisis, which caused a plunge in real estate and stock prices, he quietly acquired large amounts of stock. He said: &ldquo;At that time, many stock prices were very low, and some offered annual dividends of over 20%, higher than bank interest rates. Such stocks are rare globally.  With long-term investment, even just collecting dividends is worthwhile. As long as you choose the right stocks and invest long-term, you&rsquo;re bound to make a lot of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Brand in Real Estate Investment</strong></p>
<p>Most people&rsquo;s first real estate investment is a home for personal use, often buying pre-sale properties. There are three secrets to investing in a home: location, location, location.</p>
<p>Choosing a home should prioritize the environment.  The story of Mencius&rsquo;s mother moving three times highlights the importance of the surrounding environment, safety, and the quality of neighbors, all of which impact quality of life and children&rsquo;s development.  Transportation, amenities, and other factors should also be considered.  When purchasing pre-sale properties, focus on the &ldquo;brand.&rdquo;  Such investments carry high risks, so the developer&rsquo;s reputation and financial health are paramount, followed by practicality and growth potential.</p>
<p>In the past, when average incomes were lower, people bought cars that simply ran, were affordable, and looked decent. As demand increased and economic conditions improved, attention shifted to details, and brand and quality became more important.  Cars require maintenance and repairs.  Choosing a random repair shop can be problematic, with mechanics unfamiliar with the car model and a lack of available parts.  Therefore, buyers began to consider the after-sales service offered by the car manufacturer.</p>
<p>Similarly, people used to buy homes that were simply livable, affordable, and in a reasonably acceptable environment.  With economic growth and rising incomes, people are more demanding of quality of life, and the concept of &ldquo;brand&rdquo; has become increasingly important in real estate.  According to the Consumers&rsquo; Foundation in Taiwan, real estate litigation cases are rampant, and most cases end without resolution.</p>
<p>Many construction companies in Taiwan are &ldquo;one-project companies,&rdquo; dissolving after completing a single project.  Therefore, after purchasing a property, if any issues arise (such as unclear property rights, substandard building materials, or discrepancies in area), buyers often have no recourse.  Furthermore, problems with the internal structure of a house may not be apparent initially, surfacing only after some time, such as water leaks, wall cracks, or plumbing issues.  By then, there might be no one to hold accountable, highlighting the importance of brand reputation.</p>
<p>Real estate investment is a major life decision.  For a home, comfort is essential. Even if the purchase is for investment purposes, a &ldquo;quality-guaranteed&rdquo; property will be easier to sell and fetch a better price.</p>
<p>After-sales service is another crucial factor in real estate investment.  Many construction companies disengage after handing over the property, leaving the management committee to the homeowners.  Due to a lack of authority and resources, these committees often struggle to address issues, leading to dissatisfaction among residents.</p>
<p>Several reputable construction companies in Taiwan are now emphasizing community management and after-sales service.  For instance, Taichung&rsquo;s Sancai Construction, the company where the author currently works, entrusts community management to an affiliated company, integrating software and hardware services to create a safe and comfortable living environment.  Sancai Construction also provides security, repairs, bill payment services, and housekeeping services.</p>
<p>Therefore, future real estate investors should consider not only location and environment but also the developer&rsquo;s brand, quality, and after-sales service.  Choosing a reputable company with quality assurance, good after-sales service, and effective management is crucial for successful real estate investment.</p>

<p>The substantial investment required for real estate often deters potential investors.  The fact that property prices often rise faster than wages further contributes to the increasing wealth gap.  However, real estate investment is relatively low-risk as long as you avoid the frenzy of buying during periods of soaring prices.  Real estate, being a tangible asset, is easy to mortgage. Coupled with its high long-term returns and less visible price volatility, it&rsquo;s an ideal candidate for leveraged investment.</p>
<p><strong>The Benefit of Spreading Out Payments</strong></p>
<p>Home mortgages typically span 20 years, effectively spreading out the total cost of the property plus interest over two decades. For instance, purchasing a NT$5 million house with a 70% mortgage at a 9% interest rate over 20 years results in a monthly payment of NT$31,490.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you have NT$1.5 million in savings and can afford the monthly payments, you should consider buying a property.  The government often provides preferential interest rates for first-time homebuyers to promote homeownership.  Those without a house should take advantage of these programs.</p>
<p>Some argue that renting is more cost-effective than buying in Taiwan.  A NT$5 million house might rent for only NT$20,000 per month, while buying requires a NT$1.5 million down payment and monthly mortgage payments exceeding NT$30,000.  This argument usually arises during market downturns or periods of stagnation. However, it&rsquo;s flawed because it ignores the long-term upward trend of real estate prices.  Renting would indeed be better if prices remained constant, but they don&rsquo;t.  Given long-term price appreciation, buying is more cost-effective than renting, especially because leveraging magnifies returns, making real estate a high-yield investment. Many have become wealthy through real estate ownership.  In short, if you can afford to buy, it&rsquo;s better than renting, offering greater security and an excellent investment opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Mortgage Pressure is Manageable</strong></p>
<p>Some are reluctant to take on a mortgage due to the perceived burden of monthly payments.  Twenty years ago, NT$1 million could buy a 50+ ping luxury apartment in Taipei.  A 70% mortgage at a 9% interest rate translated to monthly payments of over NT$4,000.  Back then, a university graduate&rsquo;s starting salary was around NT$8,000 to NT$10,000, making NT$4,000 a significant burden. However, 20 years later, with inflation, experience, and increased earning power, the average monthly salary should be above NT$50,000, making the same mortgage payment much less burdensome.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, young people investing in real estate with leverage shouldn&rsquo;t be overly concerned about the initial mortgage pressure.</strong> While NT$30,000+ per month might seem daunting, future income growth will gradually ease the burden within five to ten years.</p>
<p>A manager at an American bank said: &ldquo;The biggest problem with mortgages in the US is people defaulting on their loans.  In Taiwan, the biggest problem is people paying off their mortgages early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moderate mortgage pressure can be beneficial for financial management, promoting forced savings and reduced spending. As mentioned earlier, starting early with diligent saving and investing in high-yield assets like stocks and real estate lays a solid foundation for future financial success.</p>
<p>Therefore, young people with sufficient down payment and the ability to manage monthly payments should consider leveraged investment in a home. As long as borrowing is within reasonable limits, avoiding foreclosure, long-term leveraged investment in real estate is undoubtedly advantageous.</p>

      <description>This article explores the long-term value of stock investment, using the example of Liu Qiude, Vice President of Cathay Life Insurance, to illustrate the advantages of holding high-quality stocks for the long term.  It analyzes the reasons for the high return rate of stocks, arguing that corporate profitability and asset appreciation are the main drivers of stock price increases.  The article also compares the advantages and disadvantages of stock investment and real estate investment, pointing out that stock investment has advantages such as smaller investment units, lower taxes, and easier trading.  In addition, the article discusses the future development trend of the Taiwan stock market and the characteristics of different types of stocks, recommending that investors prioritize listed stocks or mutual funds and avoid margin trading.</description>

<p>It is said that Tsai Wan-lin, once Taiwan&rsquo;s richest man and the world&rsquo;s fifth wealthiest individual, declared at a Cathay Life Insurance executive meeting, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t just want to be rich; I want those who strive with me to be rich as well.  Those of you present with less than ten million in assets, please raise your hands.&rdquo;  The executives remained silent. Not because no one dared to raise their hands, nor because no one possessed such wealth, but because for Cathay Life&rsquo;s senior management, many boasted fortunes exceeding one hundred million.</p>
<p>Liu Qiude, the current Vice President, who joined Cathay Life in his twenties, became a billionaire by following the right person and investing in the right stock. From the beginning of his career, besides the company&rsquo;s stock options, he consistently invested any spare cash in buying shares from colleagues looking to sell. When Taiwan faced political or economic crises, and some Cathay employees rushed to sell their holdings, he bought them all.  Holding these shares for two to three decades, without ever selling, he effortlessly became a billionaire.  He himself couldn&rsquo;t say exactly how many shares he owned, stating, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t know the exact number of Cathay Life shares until they are all transferred.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Unsure of His Own Dividend Earnings</strong></p>
<p>In 1981, the average price of a Cathay Life share (1000 shares) was about NT$45,000. After 15 years of stock dividends, by 1996, this had increased to 48.7 shares (see table below).  Calculated at a market price of NT$160,000 per share, the market value would be approximately NT$7.795 million, a 171-fold increase in 15 years. This impressive growth doesn&rsquo;t even include the cash dividends received over the years.  With such a staggering rate of return, it&rsquo;s no wonder Liu Qiude is unsure of his exact share count.  He&rsquo;s likely worth well over a billion, perhaps even ten billion or more.</p>

<p>The Tsai family themselves followed a similar strategy. To maintain control of Cathay Life, they held their shares long-term through investment companies.  Tsai Chen-yu, Chairman of First Commercial Bank, pointed out that selling these shares was practically impossible; they had become like real estate.  One of the main reasons Tsai Wan-lin became Taiwan&rsquo;s richest man was his ability to hold Cathay Life stock long-term.</p>
<p>Cathay Life isn&rsquo;t the only company that has created immense wealth for ordinary white-collar workers. Professional managers at several other large Taiwanese companies also accumulated significant fortunes. According to the Taiwan Stock Exchange, from the end of 1990 to April 30, 1996, the average return on all stocks was 35.41%.  During this period, holding United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) stock would have yielded a return of 726.04%, Acer 421.54%, Tatung 335.88%, China Development Financial Holding Corporation 225.55%, Uni-President Enterprises Corporation 191.30%, and Nan Ya Plastics Corporation 123.77%.  These examples demonstrate that long-term investment in blue-chip stocks can lead to substantial gains.</p>

<p>Why is long-term stock investment profitable?  First, I must clarify a key concept that all stock investors should understand. Investing in stocks generates profits primarily because the companies you invest in earn money, which ultimately belongs to the shareholders.  Your profit doesn&rsquo;t rely on other investors losing money.</p>
<p>Stocks represent ownership in a company. Stockholders are shareholders of the enterprise, and they have two inherent rights: the right to share in the company&rsquo;s profits and the right to distribute remaining assets. If the company is profitable, the profits ultimately go to the shareholders. Similarly, when a company owns assets, those assets ultimately belong to the shareholders.  Therefore, investing in profitable or asset-rich companies can, in the long run, not only yield dividends from corporate earnings but also a share of the value when assets are liquidated.</p>
<p><strong>Average Stock Market Return of 17%-18%</strong></p>
<p>The long-term price appreciation of stocks is primarily based on two factors:</p>
<p><em>(1) Increased corporate profitability leads to higher dividends for shareholders, thus driving up stock prices.</em></p>
<p><em>(2)  An increase in the value of a company&rsquo;s assets, such as real estate or investments in other stocks, ultimately benefits shareholders, therefore causing stock prices to rise.</em></p>
<p>Consequently, if a company&rsquo;s profitability continues to rise, or the value of its assets, like real estate, continues to appreciate, stock prices will inevitably rise in the long run, and shareholder returns will increase accordingly.</p>
<p>Over the past few decades, Taiwanese companies have experienced stable profit growth and rising real estate prices, resulting in stock market returns far exceeding bank deposit interest rates.  Data shows that over the past 25 years, the average annual return on the Taiwan stock market has been around 17%-18%.  In Europe, the United States, Japan, and other developed countries, the average annual return over a 10-year period is typically between 12%-17%. Simply put, the higher the economic growth rate, the higher the average long-term stock market return.</p>
<p>According to research by several scholars, the Taiwan Weighted Stock Index, starting at 100 points in 1966, reached 12,682 points over 27 years, before falling back to 2,458 points by the end of 1993.  This translates to an average annual return of over 17%.  These calculations assume that investors consistently bought stocks whenever they had funds and held them until the present without selling.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Stock Exchange conducted another study showing that if you had invested in the stock market 20 years ago and held your investments until the end of 1994 without trading, your return would have been at least 13.7 times your initial investment, with a maximum potential return of 1,384 times. This demonstrates the impressive potential of the Taiwan stock market.</p>
<p>Learning from the past can inform the future. The Taiwan stock market has historically delivered high long-term returns.  Even in recent years, investors who avoided the frenzy of speculative buying and instead opted for diversified, long-term holdings have seen decent returns.  Looking ahead, I firmly believe that readers who adhere to the principles of diversification and long-term holding can still achieve substantial results through stock investment.</p>
<p><strong>Stock Investment vs. Real Estate Investment</strong></p>
<p>This book recommends two investment tools with high potential returns: stocks and real estate.  Which is better?  The answer depends on individual financial circumstances, product knowledge, risk tolerance, and tax situation. There&rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all solution. However, stock investment offers several advantages over real estate:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Real estate investment requires larger capital, often over NT$1 million, which can be a barrier for young people entering the workforce.  Stock investment, on the other hand, can be started with just tens of thousands, or even a few thousand NT dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long-term stock investment generally incurs lower taxes than real estate.  In Taiwan, stock investments are exempt from capital gains tax, with the primary tax being securities transaction tax.  Long-term investors who avoid frequent trading pay limited taxes, and capital gains upon selling are tax-free.  Real estate investment requires annual property and land taxes, and transaction taxes upon sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stock trading is simpler than real estate transactions.  Buying or selling listed stocks requires just a phone call, and payment is made via remittance. Purchased shares are held by a centralized depository, adding to the convenience. Real estate transactions involve complex procedures for transferring ownership, which can be time-consuming.  Property management and maintenance can also be demanding.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, for investors who diversify and hold long-term, stocks are an excellent investment tool for individuals and families. Unfortunately, most stock investors are unable to withstand the fluctuations of the market and the temptation of short-term gains.  Frequent trading often leads to losses due to high transaction costs.  This explains why, despite the high average long-term returns of the stock market, few people become wealthy through stock investment.</p>
<p><strong>Can Stocks Maintain High Returns in the Future?</strong></p>
<p>Investors often ask me, &ldquo;The high average annual returns of over 20% in the past were due to Taiwan&rsquo;s rapid economic growth over the past two to three decades.  Now that Taiwan&rsquo;s economic growth has slowed, can we still expect such high returns in the future?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the question is whether the Taiwan stock market can maintain an average annual return of over 30%, I believe that&rsquo;s unlikely.  A country or region&rsquo;s stock market return is directly influenced by the profitability of its companies, which is essentially linked to the economic growth rate. Taiwan&rsquo;s economy is maturing.  While the average annual growth rate was around 9% for the past few decades, it&rsquo;s now around 6%, and this trend is expected to continue.</p>
<p>With a declining economic growth rate, it&rsquo;s improbable that the stock market will maintain returns above 20%.  However, I estimate that future stock returns should remain above 15%.  This is based on the observation that in developed economies like the US, Japan, and Europe, long-term stock returns remain between 10%-15% even after their economies mature. Although Taiwan&rsquo;s economic growth rate may decrease, a 10% growth rate is still impressive compared to other regions, making Taiwanese stocks a worthwhile investment.  Furthermore, Taiwan&rsquo;s increasing financial liberalization is likely to attract foreign investment, which will further boost the stock market&rsquo;s performance.</p>

<p>Generally, stocks can be categorized into four types: listed stocks, over-the-counter (OTC) stocks, unlisted stocks, and mutual funds.  Each type has distinct characteristics that investors should understand to avoid regrets.</p>
<p><strong>Varying Returns, Liquidity, and Security</strong></p>
<p>Listed stocks are traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.  They offer high long-term average returns, good liquidity, transparent financial and business operations, centralized trading with fair market pricing, low taxes for long-term investors (exempt from capital gains tax), and dividends eligible for tax exemptions. Listed stocks offer greater security than unlisted stocks.  I recommend that readers with long-term savings consider diversifying their investments in listed stocks and holding them long-term.</p>
<p>OTC stocks are traded on the over-the-counter market through negotiated pricing.  The trading mechanism is similar to listed stocks, but with lower trading volume and liquidity.  Generally, the listing requirements for OTC stocks are less stringent than for listed stocks, with lower requirements for capital and profitability, resulting in lower security. One disadvantage of OTC stocks is that their dividends are not eligible for tax exemptions.</p>
<p>Unlisted stocks are not traded on either the stock exchange or the OTC market.  They have lower liquidity, no fair market price, lack transparent financial and business operations, and are not subject to regulatory oversight by the Securities and Futures Bureau (SFB) and the stock exchange, resulting in higher risk and lower security. Their dividends are also ineligible for tax exemptions.  While unlisted stocks offer higher potential returns and the possibility of discovering hidden gems, their lack of oversight makes them risky.  I recommend focusing on listed stocks, which are sufficient for building wealth.  Invest in unlisted stocks only if you have a thorough understanding of the company, its valuation, and trust in its management.</p>
<p><strong>The Best Tool for Beginner Stock Investors</strong></p>
<p>Mutual funds, or investment trust funds, pool money from small investors, entrusting it to professional investment management companies.  Investment experts manage these funds with a diversified approach, and the returns belong to the original investors.  Mutual funds are classified into open-end and closed-end funds based on their issuance and trading methods.</p>
<p>Open-end funds allow investors to buy and sell shares at any time based on the net asset value.  The total amount of the fund fluctuates as investors buy and sell shares. Closed-end funds have a fixed number of shares. Investors wishing to purchase these funds must buy from existing shareholders.  Similarly, existing shareholders must sell their shares on the open market; they cannot redeem them from the issuing company.  Funds traded on the stock exchange are closed-end funds, and their transaction tax is only 1%.</p>
<p>Mutual funds are professionally managed by experts and offer diversification, generally providing good returns.  However, their long-term average returns may be lower than the overall market due to management fees, custodian fees, transaction fees, and other expenses.  Because of their smaller investment units and lower risk compared to listed stocks, mutual funds are an ideal investment tool for beginners. To avoid long-term fees, I recommend index funds, such as the Formosa Fund or CTBC Financial ETF 0050, which offer better long-term returns.</p>
<p>This book primarily recommends investing in listed stocks due to their stable long-term average returns.  Unless you have specific reasons for investing in other types of stocks, you should allocate most of your funds to listed stocks or stock mutual funds.  The most important reason is that long-term investment in listed stocks is sufficient for building wealth.</p>
<p><strong>Margin Trading is Unsuitable for Listed Stock Investment</strong></p>
<p>Some investors ask, &ldquo;If the long-term return on stocks is higher than the margin interest rate, shouldn&rsquo;t margin trading accelerate wealth accumulation?&rdquo;  Theoretically, yes. If you can diversify and hold listed stocks long-term, margin trading can leverage financial leverage to accelerate wealth growth. However, in practice, most people who use margin trading for stock investment lose money.</p>
<p>Why?  The reason is simple.  It&rsquo;s the same reason why many investors lose money in the stock market despite its high long-term average returns.  Daily stock price fluctuations tempt investors to chase short-term gains.  They become driven by greed and fear, leading to frequent trading, often buying high and selling low, which ultimately results in losses.</p>
<p>This behavior is already prevalent with fully funded stock purchases.  Margin trading exacerbates the problem. The leverage magnifies the gains and losses, further tempting investors to chase short-term profits while increasing the psychological pressure.  This leads to even more frequent trading and ultimately greater losses.</p>
<p>My research on margin trading balances for listed stocks shows that margin balances are lower when stock prices are low.  When prices rise significantly, investors begin using margin, with margin balances peaking when stock prices are high. This indicates that investors are often hesitant to use margin when they should, and aggressively use it when they shouldn&rsquo;t, when prices are already high.  In short, margin trading for listed stocks often leads to mistakes and should generally be avoided.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Market Trends and Investment Philosophy:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Drives the Future:</strong> AI demand is not a bubble, but a genuine driving force behind technological advancement, promising a bull market spanning two decades.  We are currently in the early stages of this growth.  Morris Chang (TSMC Chairman)&rsquo;s perspective and TSMC&rsquo;s investments in AI corroborate this judgment. The long bull market has begun, seize the opportunity to join the wealth train.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility and Long-Term Investment:</strong> Market fluctuations are inherent to investing.  Downswings are followed by even greater upswings. Using historical data from the Taiwan Weighted Index, Nikkei Index, and the US stock market as examples, the session illustrates the long-term market development pattern: an initial period of rapid growth followed by a period of stagnation (e.g., 32 years in Taiwan, 35 years in Japan, 24 years in the US), before entering a phase of stable growth.  Therefore, overcoming panic caused by market volatility and adhering to a long-term investment strategy is crucial for ultimate success.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalism and Investment:</strong>  The side effects of capitalism are wealth disparity and the exploitation of labor. Learn to operate like a capitalist and profit from investment.  Hard work and saving money to buy government bonds will ultimately result in wealth erosion due to inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits of Quantitative Easing:</strong> Quantitative easing is beneficial for investors, fostering a low-interest-rate environment and driving asset price appreciation.  Those who fail to understand quantitative easing and complain about government money printing are often victims of capitalism, missing out on the benefits of asset appreciation.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics of a Mature Market:</strong> Mature markets are characterized by fair, just, and transparent regulatory mechanisms, companies focused on their core businesses, and a high proportion of long-term investors and institutional holdings. The Taiwanese market is gradually maturing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Investment Strategies and Recommendations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invest in Nasdaq 100:</strong>  The session recommends investing in Nasdaq 100 index funds (QQQ), with the option to allocate to S&amp;P 500 or high-dividend ETFs based on individual circumstances.  References to Nasdaq 100 index funds globally are provided for the convenience of investors worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Penny Stocks:</strong>  Refrain from investing in penny stocks, as they generally offer low long-term returns.  Real investment opportunities lie in companies that demonstrate sustained growth and lead technological advancements.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of Stock Pledging:</strong> Stock pledging offers advantages over real estate mortgages, as stocks, unlike real estate, do not depreciate and can be held long-term, potentially allowing for &ldquo;borrowing without repayment or interest&rdquo; (specific instructions are available in related videos).</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Flawed Rebalancing Strategies:</strong> Avoid a 50% principal + 50% leveraged ETF rebalancing strategy, as it carries high risk and can easily deplete cash reserves during market downturns.</li>
<li><strong>Estate Planning and Stock Pledging:</strong> When engaging in stock pledging, it is advisable to diversify assets across multiple brokerage firms, pledging a portion and keeping the rest as cash to facilitate estate handling for inheritors.  Cat supplemented this with a detailed explanation of the stock pledging inheritance process, emphasizing the importance of advance planning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Other Important Matters:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Warning and Disclaimer:</strong>  The content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.  Do not remit funds to unknown accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Program Format Adjustment:</strong>  The presentation content will be expanded to include material previously covered in short videos.</li>
<li><strong>QQQ Stock Selection Mechanism:</strong>  Addresses audience questions regarding the QQQ stock selection mechanism, explaining the advantages of the Nasdaq exchange and why technology companies prefer listing on Nasdaq.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging for Non-US Residents:</strong> Explains the regulations for non-US residents engaging in stock pledging with US brokers.</li>
<li><strong>Learning to Spend:</strong> Shares the philosophy of spending after achieving investment success, emphasizing the importance of focusing on future wealth growth and utilizing financial leverage for consumption.  Don&rsquo;t let wealth sit idle; learn how to use it.  This point is illustrated with the example of a listener who has $4 million but doesn&rsquo;t know how to spend it, calculating their potential wealth growth over 40 years and a reasonable spending level.</li>

<p><strong>IAM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Expressed confusion about different types of economic crises and how the 2020-2023 pandemic period compares to previous bubbles after reading a book about economic crises.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  Which historical economic crisis is most similar to the economic downturn during the 2020-2023 pandemic?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The 2020-2023 pandemic was an economic shock caused by an external event, distinct from previous bubble economies. The 2000 dot-com bubble was an industry bubble with limited impact; the 2008 financial crisis resembled the 1929 Great Depression, both being asset bubble bursts, but the 2008 crisis recovered faster due to quantitative easing. The 2022 market decline was not a bubble burst, but a revaluation caused by central bank interest rate hikes.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> What did the US do to stimulate the economy that other countries couldn&rsquo;t replicate?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The US is less constrained by fiscal discipline and is willing to borrow and issue debt, allocating funds to social welfare programs for the elderly, children, and healthcare, while guiding domestic capital towards overseas investment to mitigate inflation.  Taiwan&rsquo;s government was advised to learn from the US&rsquo;s fiscal spending approach and guide capital towards investment, while also focusing on efficient capital utilization and building a social safety net.</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> Why are Chinese people so keen on buying houses?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> This is a vestige of the agrarian &ldquo;land is wealth&rdquo; mentality, which is no longer applicable today.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eason (Doctor):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Points to consider for Chinese investors buying Nasdaq ETFs:
<ul>
<li>Different brokerage firms have different fee policies and financing rates; careful comparison is necessary.</li>
<li>Domestic Nasdaq ETFs have premiums; buying during periods of low or negative premiums is recommended.  There are no limits for buying ETFs on the exchange, but there are limits for off-exchange subscriptions.</li>
<li>Recommends allocating a portion of assets to USD-denominated investments like QQQ, which can be purchased by opening brokerage accounts in Singapore or Hong Kong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Added:</strong>  Chinese residents have a $50,000 annual foreign exchange quota for overseas investments.  Hong Kong and mainland China identities have different withholding tax rates on US stock investments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dave:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Will the Nasdaq 100 index become stagnant like the Dow Jones index?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Currently, the Nasdaq 100 is the most competitive; excessive worry about the future is unnecessary.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> Is it feasible to only buy the top 10 companies in the Nasdaq 100 index?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The top ten companies change frequently; individual stock selection and portfolio adjustments are too cumbersome, and returns may not be higher.  Investing directly in index funds is more efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> How do VGT and XLK compare to QQQ?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> VGT and XLK track different indices than QQQ, with different constituent stocks and concentration. QQQ is more robust and has broader coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jiawen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Can an 80% leveraged ETF + 10% cash + 10% bond portfolio be directly pledged? How is this done?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, but a small-scale trial is recommended, for instance, borrowing $200,000 against $5 million in principal, or borrowing within $1 million against $10 million. Long-term borrowing strategies should be adjusted according to circumstances. It&rsquo;s possible to pledge only a portion of the stocks, leaving the remainder for additional purchases or other uses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Personal investment journey, transitioning from real estate to stocks, learning about stock pledging and asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Is there synergy between real estate and stock investment? How can real estate cash flow be used for stock investment?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  Buying a house is not recommended for young people. Real estate investment returns are lower than stocks and come with various risks (e.g., natural disasters, property taxes).  Even with positive cash flow, opportunity costs should be considered; investing that capital in stocks might yield higher returns.  Used Texas real estate as an example to illustrate the drawbacks of real estate investment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Qiu Xiao:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  What are the Canadian equivalents of US retirement accounts like IRA, Roth IRA, and 401k? Which account should cash be held in?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Roth IRA corresponds to Canada&rsquo;s TFSA, Traditional IRA to RRSP, and 401k to DCPP. The choice of retirement account for cash depends on the individual&rsquo;s balance between taxable and tax-free accounts and their asset allocation strategy.  One should choose to place cash in either a tax-free or taxable account based on their specific circumstances for tax optimization.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2 (Related to Eason&rsquo;s question):</strong> How can one invest in Nasdaq ETFs in China, and how can quota limitations be addressed?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Off-exchange subscriptions have quota limits, while on-exchange ETF purchases do not, but premiums should be considered.  Opening multiple brokerage accounts or opening an account in Hong Kong for US stock investment can be considered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Haoqing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Used the example of SpaceX launching rockets with a small team to highlight concerns about AI replacing human labor and the difficulties young people face in finding employment.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How can we address the challenge of youth unemployment in the AI era?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  Young people need to acquire AI skills to adapt to the future job market.  Recommends that schools incorporate AI courses into their core curriculum, cultivating AI talent from a young age. Philosophy is an important foundational subject but should not be a primary career focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jimmy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Discussed the changing times and the need for young people to adapt, sharing observations about the youthful demographics of Xiamen. Mentioned the importance of aligning investments with the times and shared some common misunderstandings about investing he had encountered.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What are your views on index fund investing? Is the long-term return of 0050 sufficient? What are your thoughts on individual stock investing (e.g., TSMC)?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Index fund investing is a method accessible to the general public, but many don&rsquo;t understand it and require time and experience to appreciate it. In the long run, QQQ and SPY offer higher returns and are more suitable for long-term investment. Individual stock picking demands specialized knowledge and skills and carries higher risks; it is difficult for average investors to select and hold high-quality stocks like TSMC for the long term.  The key to investing is finding investment targets that can be held long-term and sticking with them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Q&amp;A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TQQQ Pledging:</strong>  Learn about stock pledging and how to achieve interest-free borrowing through the recommended videos.</li>
<li><strong>Top 10 QQQ Holdings:</strong>  Frequent trading is discouraged; holding the index fund long-term is sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>BOX vs. SWVXX:</strong>  BOX is recommended for brokerage accounts to avoid dividend taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Conservative Investing:</strong>  Conservative investing can involve holding cash or holding index funds long-term.</li>
<li><strong>How to Spend Money:</strong>  Focus on future wealth growth and utilize financial leverage for consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Investing in US Stocks from within China:</strong>  Coming to the US to invest or remitting funds to the US for investment is recommended.  Consider opening an account in Hong Kong or using other compliant channels for investment.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Emotions are the biggest enemy in investing. You need to avoid being influenced by news and information, stay rational, and refrain from chasing rising or falling markets.</li>
<li>Investing requires a long-term perspective, aiming for a timeframe of 40 years or more. Warren Buffett acquired 99% of his wealth after the age of 50, demonstrating that patience is key to wealth creation.</li>
<li>Choose investment targets that are consistently stable and provide high returns. Index funds are the best option, especially QQQ, which boasts a long-term annualized return of 14%.</li>
<li>Adhere to the &ldquo;never sell&rdquo; strategy to allow assets to continue appreciating. Avoid selling stocks unless absolutely necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scam Avoidance Guide:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Be wary of various investment traps. Do not trust any projects that guarantee high returns, especially those that require you to sell existing assets for new investments.</li>
<li>Do not readily believe any investment or financial management information received via phone, text messages, or online platforms. Any information involving bank accounts or government departments must be verified through official channels.</li>
<li>Be cautious of aggressive sales tactics from financial institutions. Stick to your investment plan and avoid being lured by various fancy financial products.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Real Estate Investment:</strong>
<ul>
<li>James advises against homeownership for average working individuals, believing it turns them into &ldquo;mortgage slaves&rdquo; burdened with heavy loan pressure, hindering wealth accumulation.</li>
<li>He advocates for a &ldquo;rent instead of buy&rdquo; approach, suggesting using a stock pledge loan to rent high-quality housing at lower interest rates, then investing the saved funds for higher returns.</li>
<li>Consider purchasing real estate only when your assets reach a certain scale and you can comfortably afford the payment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New Trends in China&rsquo;s Economy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The People&rsquo;s Bank of China recently introduced a series of potent fiscal policies, including reserve requirement ratio and interest rate cuts, injecting funds into banks, and encouraging stock purchases, to stimulate economic growth.</li>
<li>These policies will contribute positively to stabilizing China&rsquo;s real estate market, boosting consumer confidence, and promoting global economic recovery.</li>
<li>Investors should pay attention to developments in the Chinese market and seize new investment opportunities.</li>

<li>James&rsquo; answer: Utilize data and case studies for illustration, such as comparing the long-term returns of fixed deposits and index funds, and sharing success stories of investors. It&rsquo;s also important to respect family members&rsquo; choices and refrain from forcing them to accept new ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Allen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Questions:  Should someone with assets worth 50 times their annual living expenses use their salary to pay for a car? How can a couple combine their stock accounts for collateral purposes?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: It is recommended to utilize Tesla&rsquo;s official website loan to purchase a vehicle, then use funds from a stock pledge loan to repay the car loan. Dedicate your salary entirely to investment. Couples can combine their accounts through a joint account for collateral, sharing the limit, while their accounts remain individually managed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Eric&rsquo;s mother is visiting the US and is concerned about medical expenses. How should this be  handled?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer:  Purchasing travel insurance is advised, but excessive worry is unnecessary. Most non-emergency situations can be treated back home. If encountering extremely high medical costs, attempting negotiation with the hospital or seeking alternative solutions is possible. Due to the specific circumstances of foreign nationality and lack of income, the hospital may choose not to pursue the medical expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dean:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Dean purchased a new car using Tesla&rsquo;s website loan and a stock pledge loan, conserving a significant amount of capital. Learning about investing boosted Dean&rsquo;s confidence to decline a high-paying job and choose to stay home with their child.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Questions: How to secure a loan from Tesla&rsquo;s official website for a car purchase? Can funds from 401k or IRA accounts be used for collateral? What are the options if QQQ is not available in their company&rsquo;s 401k plan?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: To apply for a car loan through Tesla&rsquo;s website, choose the desired model and configuration, click &ldquo;Order Now&rdquo;, and select &ldquo;Finance&rdquo;. Funds in retirement accounts cannot be used as collateral; it is recommended to transfer part of those funds to a brokerage account for collateral purposes.  Alternative options include choosing an S&amp;P 500 index fund or inquiring with the company about the possibility of Blockage Link to invest in QQQ.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EVA:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: As a single, middle-aged woman with limited savings, how to balance work and investment? Should selling the house be considered for investment purposes?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: Continue working diligently while consistently making monthly investments. Even small amounts will accumulate over 8-9 years, reaching the threshold for collateral, allowing you to leverage and accelerate wealth growth. Selling a house for investment is an option but requires careful consideration based on personal circumstances.  If renting is more cost-effective, choose to rent and allocate the funds to investments yielding higher returns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Questions:  Any knowledge regarding the latest Roth SEP IRA policy?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: The policy information is quite recent, and the accuracy of the $69,000 limit requires verification. Consulting with professionals like a financial advisor at Chase or Lisa is recommended. As it is a new product, not all institutions may offer it.</li>
<li>Sharing: Jenny shared a personal experience of being scammed, reminding everyone to exercise caution and avoid trusting any investment information, particularly those spread through unofficial channels.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Haoqing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Haoqing relayed the experiences of close friends falling victim to scams, lamenting that scam tactics are constantly evolving and are hard to guard against, even for highly educated individuals.</li>
<li>Question: How can investment concepts be better conveyed to people around us to prevent them from being deceived? Is there a need to explain professional investment knowledge?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: Avoid explaining intricate investment knowledge; simply emphasize the core principle of long-term investment in index funds. Excessive professional details may confuse them, making them more susceptible to being misled by other investment information and ultimately falling prey to scams.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Recounted an NFT scam incident encountered on Clubhouse, warning everyone to be wary of risks in the cryptocurrency world. Expressed gratitude toward James&rsquo; investment philosophy for helping them avoid such traps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Amy shared personal encounters with scams, including impersonations of government departments and courier companies. She emphasized the importance of relying only on written communication and ignoring any investment information delivered through phone calls or text messages. Amy suggested that, when in doubt, contact official channels for clarification.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Becky:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Suggestion: Avoid answering calls from unfamiliar numbers, set up spam filters, and use a less important email address when necessary to share personal information to minimize the risk of scams.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: What are your thoughts on China&rsquo;s most recent economic policies? Are they sustainable?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: The People&rsquo;s Bank of China has introduced powerful policies that are having a positive impact on economic confidence. Investors should keep an eye on these developments. Although the policies appear to be heading in a positive direction, their sustainability remains to be seen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Julia:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question:  Any updates on the Roth SEP IRA policy? Are there any financial institutions already offering related products?</li>
<li>James&rsquo; answer: The policy information is fairly new, and the $69,000 limit&rsquo;s accuracy is debatable. Consulting with a professional is advised. Being a new product, not all institutions might offer it yet.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>“You have enough money when you have enough.&quot;
&ndash; Many people</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many individuals believe that having just enough to get by is sufficient. This is a mistaken notion, as money is never truly enough. True financial freedom lies in possessing the power of choice – going wherever you want, doing whatever you desire – instead of being constrained by finances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Never borrow money for investments.&rdquo;
&ndash; Many people</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many believe that borrowing for investment is unwise; however, this viewpoint is overly cautious. True investors, like Warren Buffett, skillfully leverage debt. Following the principle of &ldquo;borrow for consumption, invest for asset growth&rdquo;, the correct approach is to use borrowed money for expenses and personal money for investment. This enables rapid wealth accumulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All investment information received through phone calls, text messages, or online platforms is not trustworthy.”
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nowadays, numerous scams operate through these channels. It&rsquo;s crucial to exercise caution and avoid blindly believing any financial advice or information. Anything involving bank accounts or government departments must be verified through official sources. Additionally, seeking guidance from qualified professionals is essential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Investment must be consistently stable over the long term, which is why index funds are the only viable option.&quot;
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within the complex investment landscape, index funds stand out as a few reliable options capable of offering consistent stability and high returns. Index funds are like living organisms; they will never die, whereas all individual stocks will eventually disappear within a century.  If you&rsquo;re looking for generational wealth, index funds are the way to go.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Investment Cycles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Investor sentiment is likened to a pendulum, swinging between extreme fear and extreme optimism.</li>
<li>Differentiating between premature judgments and incorrect ones during cycle changes is challenging, as exemplified by Buffett&rsquo;s public announcement of buying stocks in late 2008, followed by a further 30% market decline.</li>
<li>Swing trading is no longer recommended, as the market perpetually rises, making long-term investment the key.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Risks of Real Estate Investment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Real estate investment is considered high-risk, requiring maintenance and incurring high holding costs like property taxes and HOA fees.</li>
<li>US property tax is a holding tax; the longer you hold, the more tax you pay.</li>
<li>Rental yields are low, around 2% in the US Bay Area after deducting expenses.</li>
<li>The biggest risks of buying a house are job loss and having outstanding mortgage debt at retirement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insurance Choices</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid commercial insurance, such as life insurance, long-term care insurance, universal life insurance, etc.</li>
<li>Necessary insurance includes health insurance and term life insurance. Term life insurance is suitable for those who are the sole income source for their family, providing support for children under 18.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Risks of Stock Pledging</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stock pledging is extremely risky, especially in the Taiwanese market, with a maintenance ratio requirement of 167%.</li>
<li>Absolutely forbid using borrowed funds from stock pledges for reinvestment.</li>
<li>In Taiwan, leveraged ETFs can be pledged, but risks still exist.</li>
<li>Be cautious about diversifying risks in stock pledging in Taiwan. Do not pledge all assets to the same financial institution, and avoid pledging everything at once.</li>
<li>Taiwanese investors are advised to adopt the &ldquo;Situation 3&rdquo; asset allocation strategy: 30% cash, 30% leverage, and 40% QQQ or other broad-based index funds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Allocation Strategies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When selecting investment targets, understand their risk and return characteristics, and allocate assets reasonably based on your circumstances.</li>
<li>Long-term investment in QQQ index funds is like piloting an aircraft carrier—stable and offering considerable returns.</li>
<li>Investing in individual stocks and sectors is like sailing a small boat—high risk and susceptible to market fluctuations.</li>
<li>Investments in individual stocks and sectors are similar to the once-booming railway industry, which was eventually replaced by new technologies and industries. For example, the semiconductor industry may also be eliminated in the future.</li>
<li>QQQ index funds have a replacement mechanism to promptly remove underperforming stocks, maintaining overall growth momentum.</li>
<li>Investing in individual stocks requires the ability to identify potential opportunities and understand market and industry trends, as exemplified by James&rsquo; interaction with NVIDIA&rsquo;s CEO before its IPO and his purchase of Amazon shares during its slump.</li>
<li>For retirement accounts, it&rsquo;s recommended to invest all Rust account funds in leveraged ETFs, while 401K accounts can hold cash or bonds.</li>
<li>Be cautious when borrowing for investment; ensure cash flow can cover interest payments and manage risks effectively.</li>
<li>In the US, if capital gains tax is implemented, consider transferring funds to other countries.</li>
<li>Avoid investing in the Chinese market due to policy risks and economic downturn pressures.</li>
<li>Do not purchase annuity products; they offer low returns and carry risks.</li>
<li>After selling a house, do not deposit funds into IRA or traditional IRA accounts.</li>
<li>Be decisive in investing and avoid hesitation. For example, loss-making properties should be sold as soon as possible, and the funds should be invested in the stock market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

</h2>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>  Used the analogy of QQQ index funds being like aircraft carriers and individual stocks being like small boats to illustrate the advantages of index fund investing.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>  James&rsquo; channel not only shares investment knowledge but also many life stories, such as estate planning and tax planning, from which valuable lessons can be learned.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  For employed individuals using the &ldquo;Situation 2&rdquo; asset allocation strategy, is it possible to set a higher Beta value, such as 1.1 or 1.2?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  There is no upper limit for Beta, as long as cash is at least twice the amount of borrowed funds. Excel spreadsheets can be used to simulate investment outcomes under different scenarios, allowing adjustments based on individual risk tolerance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong> The US is like a Bogue bird, adept at concealing its strength and waiting for the opportune moment to reap the rewards, which aligns with the long-term investment philosophy.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Will the central bank ignore economic recession and focus solely on inflation?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  The central bank will not ignore economic recession because it leads to increased unemployment, which is one of the central bank&rsquo;s key concerns. Economic recession and unemployment are closely related.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cheng Ge (PC):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>  Illustrated the drawbacks of investment-linked insurance policies through a real-life case study, recommending early surrender and transferring funds to QQQ index funds to recoup losses within a shorter timeframe and achieve higher returns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lang:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Is it feasible to utilize market downturns to buy QLD leveraged ETFs using a Roth IRA account and convert a 401K account to cash, aiming to increase the proportion of funds in the Roth IRA account?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  If Rust account funds are limited, they should all be invested in leveraged ETFs. The 401K account can hold cash as a hedge. There&rsquo;s no need to wait for market downturns to make the switch; asset allocation should be completed as early as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tina:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  If the 401K account is already maxed out, is it still possible to invest in an IRA account?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> After maxing out the 401K account, you cannot contribute to a traditional IRA account, but you can contribute to a Roth IRA account. Specific eligibility depends on income level and IRA contribution limits. It&rsquo;s recommended to check the IRA contribution limit for relevant information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IAM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Will events like the Malaysian currency devaluation and the Hong Kong emigration wave impact the US economy and the US dollar? How does the US prevent currency devaluation? Will the companies in the QQQ index fund be affected?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> A country&rsquo;s currency value depends on its creditworthiness, which is backed by national industries and power. The US possesses strong national strength and diversified industries, allowing the US dollar to maintain its strong position. The US government will safeguard the interests of American companies and citizens. It&rsquo;s uncertain whether US companies will be directly affected by US dollar devaluation, but they will undoubtedly be protected by the US government.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TT:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Are you still considering cycle investing at present?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  Yes, cycle investing will be considered, but not through the all-in, all-out approach used in the past. Instead, Beta adjustments will be employed to navigate market volatility, as it&rsquo;s difficult for a large number of investors to keep up with rapid trading, thus requiring a more robust strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Which US political party, Democrat or Republican, is more favorable to investors?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  In the long run, policies of both parties have minimal impact on investors. The market adjusts according to policies; for example, higher tax rates may induce investors to hold assets for longer periods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>YJ:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Are there any differences in asset allocation strategies between Taiwan and the US? What is the role of the 00864B bond? Why is investing in 00757 no longer recommended?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Asset allocation strategies are universally applicable. The main differences between Taiwan and the US lie in stock pledging rules and leveraged ETF choices. 00864B can be used as a cash alternative, similar to a USD fixed deposit. Reasons for no longer recommending investment in 00757 can be found in the videos from 2021 and 2022.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Can dollar-cost averaging (DCA) be used to invest in leveraged ETFs like Q2D?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> When investing in any asset, including leveraged ETFs, lump-sum purchasing should be adopted instead of DCA. Returns from DCA are likely to be lower than lump-sum purchasing.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>QQQ index funds are like aircraft carriers, offering stability and substantial returns, while individual stock and sector investments are like sailing small boats, carrying high risk and vulnerability to market fluctuations.
&ndash; James &amp; Eric</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Choosing long-term investment in QQQ index funds can mitigate the risks associated with individual stocks and sector investments, providing more stable returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The central bank will not disregard economic recession, as it leads to rising unemployment, a key indicator that the central bank monitors.
&ndash;  James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the objectives of the central bank&rsquo;s monetary policy is to maintain low unemployment; therefore, it will not stand idly by in the face of economic recession.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Loss aversion is a common mistake among investors. Losses should be cut promptly, and funds should be reallocated to higher-quality assets.
&ndash; Cheng Ge (PC)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s crucial to overcome the psychological barrier of loss aversion in investing, decisively cutting losses to prevent them from escalating.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The US&rsquo;s national strength rests on four pillars: government, the financial industry, businesses, and national defense. These four pillars work in synergy to achieve strategic goals.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>America&rsquo;s robust, comprehensive national strength is the cornerstone of the US dollar&rsquo;s strong position.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the long term, policies of both US parties have a limited impact on investors; the market adjusts itself based on policies.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The market has a self-regulating mechanism, enabling it to adapt to various policy environments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When investing in any asset, including leveraged ETFs, lump-sum purchasing should be adopted instead of dollar-cost averaging (DCA). Returns from DCA are likely to be lower than lump-sum purchasing.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Buy whenever you have money&rdquo; is the investment strategy James consistently emphasizes. DCA is less efficient for long-term investment.</p>

<p>This session focuses on the philosophy of long-term investing, emphasizing the importance of independent thinking and risk management. James reiterates his long-held investment philosophy: choose the right investment target (such as QQQ), buy in early and hold for the long term, ignoring short-term market fluctuations, and ultimately achieve steady wealth growth. In addition, he discusses how to maintain a positive mindset, deal with stress and anxiety that may arise during the investment process, and how to choose a reliable brokerage to ensure account security.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth is accumulated slowly, and enjoying the process of wealth accumulation is the meaning of life.</strong> Getting rich overnight or quickly is not the best way. Slowly accumulating wealth and enjoying it allows you to experience the true meaning of life and learn and grow from it.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t blindly pursue high returns while ignoring risks.</strong> Many people pursue quick riches and hope for super high returns, but often overlook the risks involved, which may ultimately lead to losses outweighing gains. Learn to assess risk and choose an investment strategy that matches your risk tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>Investing requires finding a definite eternity, ignoring market noise, and maintaining inner peace.</strong> Index fund investing is a definite and eternal strategy that does not require painstaking research and operation. Simply holding for the long term can yield considerable returns.</li>
<li><strong>Investment is a loser&rsquo;s game, not seeking to win, but seeking not to lose.</strong>  In investing, avoiding mistakes is more important than pursuing victory. Index fund investing can help investors reduce mistakes and ultimately achieve victory.</li>
<li><strong>Buying in a lump sum at any time and holding for the long term is superior to other investment methods.</strong> Investing early and holding for the long term maximizes returns and delivers the best investment returns.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to distinguish between what can be done, what is effective, what can be worried about, and what is not worth worrying about.</strong> Focus your energy on important and solvable issues, ignore those that are irrelevant or beyond your control to improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t work too hard, let your money work for you.</strong> Put your money into the market and let it create wealth for you instead of devoting all your energy to work. Learn to utilize investment tools to achieve passive wealth growth.</li>
<li><strong>All pressure comes from expectations, and all worries come from not having a solution.</strong> Lower your expectations and actively seek solutions to relieve stress and anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to transfer pressure to those who can bear it and think about solutions for the worst-case scenario.</strong> Don&rsquo;t bear the pressure alone, learn to seek help, and think in advance about solutions to the worst-case scenario to calmly deal with challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain inner peace, focus on the important things, and ignore the insignificant things.</strong> Stick to simple things, don&rsquo;t get involved in complex things, to maintain inner peace and focus on what really matters in life.</li>
<li><strong>Account security is the primary issue in investing. Choose a large, reputable brokerage to open an account and avoid using online brokers.</strong> Online brokers have security risks, such as account theft and asset freezing. Choosing a large, reputable brokerage can better protect your account security.</li>

<p><strong>Dave:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
Shared the results of James&rsquo; TQQQ simulation backtest and raised the question of how to avoid the risk of a sharp TQQQ drawdown.</li>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
James believes that it is impossible to predict the market and avoid all risks completely. The important thing is to control risk exposure and avoid over-betting. If you are worried about the volatility of TQQQ, you can choose a more conservative investment strategy, such as QQQ. James also reminds everyone to distinguish between personal thinking and public advice, and not to be easily swayed by the thoughts of others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minjianlian:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
Shared his experience of investing in stocks through his company&rsquo;s savings association, as well as discussions about the MAGS fund and emergency funds.</li>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ol>
<li>About the MAGS fund: James believes that it is uncertain whether the MAGS fund can outperform QQQ in the long term. Investment should choose targets that have been tested by time, such as QQQ or SPY.</li>
<li>About emergency funds: James believes that emergency funds are a personal responsibility and government policies cannot be relied upon entirely. Everyone should prepare sufficient emergency funds according to their own circumstances to cope with contingencies.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Learn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
Regarding the performance of 00670L, James explained the performance difference caused by USD hedging and how to solve it by investing in QLD through sub-brokerage. He emphasized that Beta and ROI are different concepts. Beta represents volatility, not ROI. The investment model in Taiwan needs to be adjusted according to specific circumstances, such as  maintenance margin requirements and exchange rate fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>JJU:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
Shared his insights on market unpredictability and the importance of mentors and friends. He believes that investing, in addition to selecting good targets, is more about maintaining inner peace and enhancing one&rsquo;s spiritual level.</li>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ol>
<li>About the difference between reinvest and buy share: James explained the difference between reinvesting and buying shares. The former automatically invests dividends or capital gains into the investment target, while the latter uses new funds to buy shares.</li>
<li>About the fund ratio of Roth IRA and Individual Brokerage Account: It is recommended to maximize the Roth IRA limit if possible.</li>
<li>About real estate mortgage investment: It is recommended to sell the property if possible to reduce the risk of investing in real estate. Otherwise, consider a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) for investment, but pay attention to risk control and ensure that you can repay the loan on time. HELOC is a revolving credit line, similar to a credit card, which can be withdrawn and repaid at any time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Draft down:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>
Proposed the possibility of leveraging 0% interest credit cards for investment and using the box spread strategy to increase capital utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ol>
<li>About credit card investment: James believes that credit card limits are limited and there is a risk of not being able to renew the loan, making it unsuitable as a main source of investment funds. It is only suitable for short-term turnover of small amounts of funds.</li>
<li>About the box spread strategy: James believes that the box spread strategy is too complex and risky and is not recommended for ordinary investors.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question and James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ol>
<li>How to overcome short-term pain in the investment process: James suggested lowering expectations, not pursuing perfection or getting rich quickly, finding solutions to problems, and transferring the pressure to those who can bear it, such as superiors or more experienced individuals. Think about solutions for the worst-case scenario, such as job loss or investment losses, and maintain a positive mindset, believing that the problem will eventually be solved.</li>
<li>About non-US tax resident investing in US stocks: James believes that non-US tax residents can use their passports to open brokerage accounts in the US without a Social Security Number. It is recommended to choose large, reputable brokers, such as Charles Schwab, and avoid using online brokers, such as Webull and Robinhood, as online brokers have security risks and imperfect regulations.</li>
