<p>The core of this lecture is to emphasize <strong>persisting in long-term investment in the Nasdaq 100 index fund, prioritizing risk control and reasonable asset allocation, and maintaining an extremely optimistic investment mindset</strong>. Teacher James points out that market volatility is normal; investors should ignore short-term fluctuations, focus on long-term growth, recognize the critical role of cash in asset allocation, and ultimately achieve financial freedom and life&rsquo;s purpose.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Market&rsquo;s Normal State</strong>: Global situations and market turmoil are normal. Investors should remain calm and not be disturbed by short-term volatility, international affairs, market analysis, financial statements, or economic conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This channel is a pro bono sharing platform and does not constitute investment advice. There are no fees, no alternate accounts, and be wary of scams. Investing involves risk, which you must manage yourself. Relevant links are pinned in the YouTube comments section.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Path</strong>: Newcomers are advised to start with &ldquo;00451 The One-Dollar Investment Lecture,&rdquo; think independently, and find a method that suits them. Quiet study improves the quality of thought more than joining too many groups.</li>
<li><strong>Core Investment Vehicle</strong>: Focus on the Nasdaq 100 index fund (like QQQ). Page 10 of the handout provides a selection of related funds worldwide. The videos started in 2018, and there is a complete 2022 course playlist available.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Mentality</strong>: Always be extremely optimistic, always face the sun; the market will eventually go up. Investing requires patience (ignoring market fluctuations), and financial freedom is worth the wait. Please like, comment, and subscribe on all platforms.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stablecoins and Short-Term Treasuries</strong>: A student asked if the issuance of stablecoins would increase demand for short-term treasuries and lower their interest rates. Teacher James believes short-term treasury rates are tied to the central bank&rsquo;s rates and won&rsquo;t fall significantly because of this. Short-term treasuries are similar to money market funds with low volatility. The central bank&rsquo;s rate is the benchmark; no one would buy a bond with a lower rate.</li>
<li><strong>The Trap of Long-Term Bonds</strong>: Long-term bond interest is linked to inflation expectations for many years to come, and the interest is fixed.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: For a 30-year Treasury bond with a 5% coupon rate, if inflation is 3%, the real annualized rate of return (Real IRR) is only 1.94%. In contrast, if short-term rates are 4%, it is far superior to the real return of long-term bonds. The $5 in interest you receive after 30 years will have long been devalued.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: It is not recommended for individual investors to buy long-term government bonds. Issuing long-term bonds is advantageous for the U.S. Treasury because the long-term interest is close to zero for the issuer (after considering inflation). Even if the central bank&rsquo;s rate is below 2%, buying long-term bonds is not necessarily a good deal. The Treasury has its own issuance plan and won&rsquo;t easily change it due to shifts in the central bank&rsquo;s rates. The idea of issuing 100-year bonds is impractical and tantamount to default.</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Awareness</strong>: The first priority in investing is risk control; the world is full of uncertainties (like the conflict in Israel).</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Asset Allocation</strong>: Good asset allocation is a &ldquo;master strategy&rdquo; (奇门遁甲), a powerful &ldquo;Army, Navy, and Air Force&rdquo; deployment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash</strong>: The &ldquo;food and air&rdquo; of asset allocation, the most important part. Sufficient cash prevents market panic.</li>
<li><strong>Index Fund</strong>: The &ldquo;aircraft carrier&rdquo; of asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraged Fund</strong>: Like the &ldquo;missile force.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging</strong>: The &ldquo;Transformer&rdquo; of asset allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Courage to Sell a House for Investment</strong>: Selling your primary residence to rent and investing the funds in an index is an excellent financial strategy, but it requires a strong mind and the courage to face social judgment (e.g., fear of being told you&rsquo;re &ldquo;not doing well&rdquo;). In reality, this is a sign of &ldquo;doing exceptionally well.&rdquo;</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Difficulty of Educating Family and Friends</strong>: Family and friends would rather trust the annuities and savings insurance (1% return) recommended by bank advisors than accept advice about index funds (10% long-term return), even when presented with spreadsheets. The main reason is the fear of &ldquo;what if it drops?&rdquo;
<ul>
<li><strong>Counter-strategy</strong>: First, become a &ldquo;big tree&rdquo; yourself and influence them with your own success. Your words carry little weight when you&rsquo;re insignificant; &ldquo;familiarity breeds contempt&rdquo; (近庙欺神). It&rsquo;s hard to distinguish &ldquo;saints&rdquo; from &ldquo;demons&rdquo; in society.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive Roots of the Wealth Gap</strong>: Poverty is often caused by a lack of awareness, not systemic issues. CLEC aims to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; this &ldquo;disease of poverty,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s very difficult; even family members may not accept it. Some people can&rsquo;t accept good medicine and instead buy things like long-term bonds.</li>
<li><strong>The Challenges of Individual Stock Investing</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: NVIDIA&rsquo;s stock price fluctuates wildly. It was once sold off due to poor sales and excess inventory, then soared because of AI. It&rsquo;s difficult for individual investors to grasp; even if you bought it, you might not have held on for the entire ride.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Individual stocks are volatile, information is asymmetric, and they can suddenly be cut in half or go to zero. ETFs provide a more stable way to share in market growth. It&rsquo;s also very hard to stick with a portfolio of mixed-quality individual stocks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Dangers of Short-Term Trading</strong>: Short-term trading is like &ldquo;gambling + drug addiction.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s addictive and leads not only to financial loss but also the loss of family, health, and self, potentially ruining one&rsquo;s entire life. There&rsquo;s no need to become a &ldquo;boy wonder trader.&rdquo;</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profit Motives of Banks and Insurance Companies</strong>: Criticizes post offices and banks for persuading depositors (especially the elderly) to buy annuity insurance, structured notes, and similar products. This is a failure of financial regulators.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Issues</strong>: Believes financial regulators should ensure the separation of savings, insurance, wealth management, and lending to avoid conflicts of interest. American commercial banks (like BofA) don&rsquo;t proactively sell insurance. Taiwan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Financial Holding Company&rdquo; model is described as an &ldquo;all-encompassing, one-stop-shop scam.&rdquo; Charles Schwab only mentions loan options when a client has a large funding need.</li>
<li><strong>The Goal of the Insurance Industry</strong>: To convert large amounts of fixed deposits into insurance policies, which is the main objective of the insurance industry, given the huge amount of fixed deposits in Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>The Risk of Mortgaging Property to Buy Insurance</strong>: There have been cases where the property mortgage remains, but the insurance policy&rsquo;s value drops to zero, leaving people homeless. These institutions &ldquo;will go as far as making people homeless.&rdquo;</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>On Publishing a Book/Media Exposure</strong>: Teacher James frankly states that if he were to publicly promote his ideas like &ldquo;investing with loans&rdquo; and &ldquo;not buying a house,&rdquo; he could violate financial regulations (practicing without a license), offend powerful interest groups (real estate, insurance, finance), and even face cyberbullying and political pressure (being labeled &ldquo;pro-Taiwan independence&rdquo; or &ldquo;pro-CCP&rdquo;). He could be &ldquo;torn to shreds&rdquo; or even &ldquo;end up in jail.&rdquo; If he doesn&rsquo;t discuss many of these topics, the teaching loses its meaning. The very people you help might turn around and curse you.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance</strong>: An insurance policy with a 1.06% annual return is acceptable if it includes protection, but it&rsquo;s generally not recommended.</li>
<li><strong>Caring for Parents</strong>: Re-emphasizes the loneliness and health risks of elderly people living alone (not taking medicine on time, not measuring blood sugar/pressure, leading to complications like worsening COPD, minor strokes, brain atrophy, mental disorders). Advises children to pay attention and provide companionship early. Even if parents seem self-sufficient, consider arranging for a caregiver early to prevent accidents and ensure a regular routine (medication, diet, avoiding falls). Shares his regret of not returning to Taiwan in time to accompany his mother, who, despite having other children in Taiwan, was not adequately cared for while living alone. Emphasizes that parents&rsquo; health is the children&rsquo;s happiness.</li>
<li><strong>A Partner&rsquo;s Investment Philosophy</strong>: Accept individual differences. Due to different upbringings and personal experiences (like living through the dot-com and 2008 bubbles), security levels and cognitions vary. Lead by example and influence them gradually with long-term results; don&rsquo;t force it. It&rsquo;s normal for them not to listen to you, just as you may not listen to them.</li>
<li><strong>00662 (Taiwan ETF) Currency Impact</strong>: Short-term currency fluctuations are normal. For instance, when the Taiwan dollar depreciated in the previous two years, 00662 outperformed QQQ. In the long run, currency effects tend to cancel each other out.</li>
<li><strong>Credit Loans vs. Stock Pledges</strong>: Credit loans are relatively independent and safe. Stock pledges are high-risk; a sharp market downturn could trigger a margin call, making it like a &ldquo;loan shark&rdquo; — you have to pay back when they demand it, or you&rsquo;re &ldquo;shot dead with one bullet.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Brokerage Firms Raising Pledge Rates and Risks</strong>: Brokerages like Capital Securities in Taiwan might raise interest rates after a client has borrowed, or even restrict withdrawals (due to limited funding pools), &ldquo;luring you into a trap.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s advisable to prioritize more stable brokerages like Yuanta Securities.</li>
<li><strong>Apply for Credit Loans Early</strong>: Bank credit policies can change. When you qualify (e.g., with an interest rate below 2%), you should apply early. Seize the opportunity when a bank proactively offers you a loan.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging in Hong Kong</strong>: HSBC is a good choice, especially for VIP clients with large capital (e.g., over 1 million HKD). HSBC&rsquo;s pledge interest rates are currently low. Friends from Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, etc., who successfully open an account and get a pledge loan from HSBC are welcome to share their experiences.</li>
<li><strong>QQQ Compounding</strong>: The annualized rate of return (CAGR), according to Teacher James&rsquo;s research, is around 18% (including dividend reinvestment).</li>
<li><strong>Repayment of Investment Mortgage</strong>: Typically, it&rsquo;s a lump-sum repayment at maturity (10-15 years). By then, you can sell some stocks or use another pledged loan to repay it. You need more than 15 years to ensure profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Compound Frequency</strong>: Refers to capital gains and dividend reinvestment.</li>
<li><strong>Philosophy of Helping Others</strong>: There are different levels of helping others. The lowest is for others (hoping for their well-being). The next is for oneself (deriving happiness or meaning from it). The highest is selflessness (helping is a natural act, regardless of for whom, or whether it brings happiness, like the Buddha or Jesus; it&rsquo;s natural ethics). Using helping others to add meaning and happiness to one&rsquo;s own life is actually &ldquo;not right.&rdquo; The highest state is &ldquo;like water flowing without a trace&rdquo; (传过水无痕).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: An elderly friend, who was once very influential in the market, agrees with Teacher James&rsquo;s index investing philosophy. This elder confessed that his past outsized returns were due to information asymmetry and his influence (manipulating small-cap stocks), which is not replicable for ordinary investors. He believes it&rsquo;s not easy for ordinary people to make money in the market, and index investing is the most correct path.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Index investing not only makes you money but also gives you a &ldquo;life&rdquo; (improves quality of life). Even if you make money from short-term trading, you might lose your life due to constant anxiety (e.g., being unable to take a 15-day vacation with peace of mind).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sharing (Follow-up)</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Reflecting on her family life, she emphasizes love and companionship for her parents to avoid regrets. She sees Teacher James&rsquo;s actions as &ldquo;dedication&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;charity&rdquo; with a sense of superiority and feels for the misunderstandings he might face.</li>
<li>Shares her future plans: to establish a women&rsquo;s financial academy (focusing on female financial awareness, as Chinese women are relatively disadvantaged, and financial independence provides more confidence), volunteer in hospice care (to learn about &ldquo;fasting until death&rdquo; and euthanasia), travel, read, and set up scholarships, reflecting a desire for &ldquo;altruism&rdquo; (influenced by Kazuo Inamori&rsquo;s philosophy of &ldquo;altruism&rdquo;).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Commends Kacy&rsquo;s practice of accompanying her parents. Shares the joy of his own father, in his 90s, still planning a trip to Korea. Advises that for elderly parents, even if they appear healthy, one should consider arranging for a caregiver early to prevent accidents and ensure a regular routine (medication, diet). Parents&rsquo; health is the children&rsquo;s happiness. If parents have medical needs, like follow-up visits every three months or low-dose lung cancer screenings, they should be supported.</li>
<li>Greatly admires Kacy&rsquo;s &ldquo;altruistic&rdquo; plans, believing that from a women&rsquo;s financial academy to educating disadvantaged groups, it&rsquo;s all very meaningful. It&rsquo;s right to start planning now.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: His mother noticed his mood has become calmer and happier recently. He explained it&rsquo;s because through investing (practicing the teacher&rsquo;s teachings), he has found meaning in life and is confident about his future wealth, no longer worrying about finances. This has led to an internal change from external influences.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Shares his own longing and regrets regarding his mother, how in his youth he failed to fully grasp the loneliness and hardship of an elderly person living alone (e.g., his mother falling while going to the doctor alone, and his own failure to return to Taiwan to be with her). Reminds everyone to care for their parents, especially those living alone, after achieving financial freedom early, to avoid life&rsquo;s regrets. Advises young people to learn from wise elders (like Warren Buffett) to avoid many pitfalls and find a &ldquo;mental coach.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Following the teacher&rsquo;s guidance, he used an investment mortgage to invest in 00662. After using a portion of the funds from high-dividend ETFs to pay the monthly interest, there&rsquo;s still a surplus each month. Should he invest this in 00865 (short-term bond/cash-like ETF) or continue buying fractional shares of 00662?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Continue buying 00662. The emergency fund (00865) only needs to be built up to a certain level (e.g., 2-3 years of living expenses for someone employed). Any excess funds should be invested in growth assets.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: Recalls entering the market in 2018, with emotions fluctuating with the market, having once lost 50%. A wise friend enlightened her (&ldquo;Save money when you&rsquo;re making it, and just wait it out when it&rsquo;s down&rdquo;), teaching her to remain calm through ups and downs and become numb to the market. Mentions how wealthy people view money (a piece of clothing costs 500-600k; money is like trash to them). Grateful for the teacher&rsquo;s guidance that has &ldquo;filled her head.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: Has come to understand the teacher&rsquo;s mindset that &ldquo;all sharing is for self-fulfillment, not for rewards.&rdquo; When sharing investment ideas with others, she encounters different reactions: some (who have worked for 20-30 years and are set in their ways) cling to old concepts, while others, despite living in hardship (a single mother working two jobs), are willing to listen. Through sharing, she has also gained a sense of value by giving back the knowledge she has learned.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: (Regarding Sharing 2) Helping others can bring happiness, but the highest state is to be &ldquo;unaffected by helping,&rdquo; meaning helping others is a natural act, not for happiness, not for self. The lowest level is &ldquo;for others,&rdquo; i.e., for their benefit; the second level is &ldquo;for oneself,&rdquo; i.e., achieving self-actualization through helping (the teacher admits his own teaching is to find value in retirement); the highest is &ldquo;selflessness,&rdquo; where even the thought of &ldquo;for myself&rdquo; is gone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: After sharing investment concepts with friends, how can she determine if they truly understand? Are there any questions to ask to test them? (Friends listen and think it&rsquo;s logical but can&rsquo;t articulate it themselves.)
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: It&rsquo;s hard to judge with simple questions. True understanding is reflected in action (like opening an account to invest). A more effective way is like how Frank guided him back in the day (meeting for dinner every week, hand-holding him through opening an account, starting with a $200 Mutual Fund), guiding them step-by-step to open an account, make their first investment, and follow up continuously. This is a process of &ldquo;sowing seeds&rdquo;; whether and when they sprout is unknown. He himself was &ldquo;led by the hand&rdquo; by Frank to get started. Now, he is willing to be such a guide, with the Bodhisattva spirit of &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t descend into hell, who will?&rdquo;</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Individual Differences</strong>: The same seeds planted result in different flowers, just as people receive information differently. Their internal &ldquo;genes&rdquo; determine their level of acceptance and reaction (some &ldquo;get it,&rdquo; others &ldquo;laugh it off&rdquo;). The gardener (the sharer) cannot change the seed&rsquo;s nature.</li>
<li><strong>Patient Guidance</strong>: A good gardener will loosen the soil and water, helping it grow, just as a mentor guides students to open accounts and invest.</li>
<li><strong>Inner Joy</strong>: The pleasure derived from tilling the soil and weeding surpasses the rewards of all fame and fortune. This effort is not for a return but for self-actualization.</li>
<li><strong>Practical Example</strong>: She once guided a friend to buy QQQ. The friend sold during a dip and missed the subsequent 45% gain. She only sent a screenshot and said no more, believing it was also &ldquo;fate.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Translating for the Elderly at a Doctor&rsquo;s Visit</strong>: Shares her experience as a volunteer translator for the elderly, realizing their immense need in medical communication. Such small acts can bring great help and a ray of light into their lives.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Agrees with the views on &ldquo;destiny&rdquo; and intrinsic motivation. Shares his own experience of planting tomatoes, where three seeds grew very differently; one was a &ldquo;chosen seedling&rdquo; and very robust, while others were &ldquo;sickly.&rdquo; Cites Dr. Yang Ding-I&rsquo;s view to &ldquo;look inward.&rdquo; For people you can&rsquo;t change, don&rsquo;t force it. Be yourself, don&rsquo;t be discouraged by it; giving up is an option. Affirms the value of her volunteer work.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Came into contact with CLEC in 2024 through a friend (who had mentioned it 5 years ago, but she was indifferent at the time). In her 50s, she has been interested in investing since graduating from college and has been exploring on her own for years. She was deeply moved after listening to the lectures and has invested a lot of time in studying (finished the 2021-2022 courses and is now re-listening). She shared it with a hundred people, and only two took action, but she still feels gratified.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Regarding the choice between a credit loan and a stock pledge in Taiwan. She leans towards using the stock pledge first (2.56% interest, no principal repayment, only interest), because of its convenience. She thinks she can use a credit loan (already approved for a 3 million TWD limit, but requires installment repayments) as a backup if the stock market crashes. She believes her job is stable (banks are always begging her to take out loans), so she&rsquo;s not afraid of unemployment and can access the credit loan anytime.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: (In a firm tone, repeatedly emphasizing) <strong>Absolutely do not do this!</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: Money borrowed from a stock pledge <strong>must not be reinvested in the stock market</strong>. It can only be used for living expenses or to repay other loans. This is &ldquo;the first thing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Huge Risk</strong>: When the market crashes, banks may tighten credit (&ldquo;take away the umbrella in the rain&rdquo;), and you might not be able to borrow money then. If you lose your job at the same time, it&rsquo;s even more impossible. A credit loan is not something you can just &ldquo;hold there&rdquo; forever.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy All Troops (韩信点兵)</strong>: All available &ldquo;forces&rdquo; (including the credit loan) should be deployed to the &ldquo;battlefield&rdquo; (investment) as early as possible.</li>
<li><strong>The Correct Approach</strong>: You should first take out the credit loan (e.g., 3 million TWD) and invest it in the market. The monthly loan repayments can be paid using funds from a low-interest stock pledge. This way, the principal continues to work in the market, and your personal salary can also be invested. Don&rsquo;t take a huge risk just because you&rsquo;re &ldquo;too lazy to repay the principal&rdquo; or tempted by the short-term convenience of a pledge.</li>
<li><strong>Safety of Credit Loans</strong>: A credit loan is a relatively safe form of leverage, not directly linked to market fluctuations, and you won&rsquo;t get a margin call. With a stock pledge, even if you only borrow 10% (e.g., pledging 1 million from a 10 million asset portfolio—the teacher thinks 10% is already a huge risk, let alone the 2-3 million she wants to borrow), you could face risks in an extreme market downturn.</li>
<li><strong>Brokerage Risk</strong>: Some brokerages in Taiwan (like Capital Securities) may change their pledge interest rates, and their limited funding pools might prevent you from withdrawing funds as needed.
(Kacy and other students also chimed in, emphasizing the risk of banks &ldquo;taking away the umbrella in the rain&rdquo; and the fundamental difference between credit loans and pledges, and that pledged money cannot be used to buy more stocks).</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Market fluctuations have nothing to do with me, international affairs have nothing to do with me, market analysis has nothing to do with me, financial statements have nothing to do with us, and the economic situation doesn&rsquo;t matter at all. Don&rsquo;t pay attention to it. The more you pay attention, the more mistakes you&rsquo;ll make.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Teacher James emphasized at the beginning the composure investors should have, not letting external noise affect their investment decisions.</p>

&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Background: Emphasizing that the primary principle of investing is safety, in response to a student&rsquo;s question about credit loans versus stock pledges.</p>
<blockquote>

&ndash; IM</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Student IM sharing her transformation from anxiously watching the market to maintaining a calm composure towards market fluctuations.</p>

<p>In this session, Teacher James systematically re-emphasized his core investment philosophy: consistently buy and hold the Nasdaq 100 index fund, fearless of short-term market volatility. He focused on analyzing the extreme importance of risk control, viewing reasonable asset allocation (especially an adequate cash reserve) as the cornerstone of investment success. Through specific examples, the teacher revealed the investment value trap of long-term bonds and severely criticized certain misleading and detrimental practices in the financial industry, especially warning investors against low-return products like annuities and savings insurance. At the same time, he pointed out the huge uncertainty of individual stock investing and the destructive nature of short-term trading. During the Q&amp;A session, students actively shared their insights and confusions from their investment practices, family communication, and personal growth. Teacher James not only provided specific investment advice (such as the correct use and risk perception of credit loans versus stock pledges) but also guided students from a life philosophy perspective to reflect on the meaning of wealth, work, family, and personal value, encouraging everyone on the path to financial freedom to continuously enhance their cognition, maintain a positive mindset, pay attention to family and social responsibilities, and ultimately give back to society.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Sell Stocks</strong>: Market volatility is normal and irrelevant to the goals of long-term investors; do not sell stocks because of it. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sell stocks, don&rsquo;t sell stocks, don&rsquo;t sell stocks&rdquo; is the core discipline.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Asset Allocation</strong>: Proper asset allocation (e.g., retirees at least 30% cash, or 10-15 years of living expenses; young people at least 1 year of living expenses in cash) ensures a worry-free life during extreme market conditions (such as the 10-year market downturn after the 2000 tech bubble), preventing panicked and reckless operations.
<ul>
<li>For example, with 2% annual living expenses, holding 15 years of cash means 30% cash. If holding 40% cash, then there are 20 years of living expenses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Harm of Reckless Operations</strong>: Some people panic due to market declines after pledging stocks, and their reckless operations lead to difficult situations. If you have enough cash and don&rsquo;t operate recklessly, there won&rsquo;t be problems.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding Market Phenomena</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical Phenomenon vs. Chemical Phenomenon</strong>: Events like tariff wars are physical phenomena (like blowing up a balloon, there&rsquo;s push and pull, eventually finding an equilibrium), not chemical phenomena (permanent change, irreversible). Therefore, short-term factors like international situations, market analysis, financial reports, economic conditions, and celebrity remarks (e.g., Trump&rsquo;s speeches) are irrelevant to long-term investment strategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Beware of Inner &ldquo;Demons and Monsters&rdquo;</strong>:
<ul>
<li>When thoughts like &ldquo;What should I do if the market drops next?&rdquo; or &ldquo;The market keeps rising, I should sell some and buy back when it falls?&rdquo; arise, these are inner &ldquo;demons and monsters&rdquo; at play, a very dangerous signal, and such thinking should stop immediately.</li>
<li>When you think, &ldquo;Wow, I&rsquo;ve made so much money, I&rsquo;ve struck it rich, I&rsquo;m wealthy!&rdquo; this is also a dangerous signal; greed has appeared.</li>
<li>When you think, &ldquo;How can it keep falling like this? What if the market drops to zero, what will I do?&rdquo; this is the emergence of the &ldquo;demon&rdquo; of fear.</li>
<li>Greed and fear stem from feelings about the market. View the market like a variety show; financial media and analysts are like hosts and guests—just laugh it off. If you can watch market fluctuations (like a 10% rise or fall in a day) without any inner turmoil, then you can pay attention to the market.</li>
<li>The goal is &ldquo;it will definitely rise in 20 years&rdquo;; short-term corrections are normal.</li>

<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Do What You Don&rsquo;t Understand</strong>: Those who don&rsquo;t understand financial tools like Beta, leverage, etc. (e.g., can&rsquo;t even calculate Beta), should stick to investing only in index funds (like QQQ) and keep ample cash. 70% investment, 30% cash can also lead to a good life.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Always Extremely Optimistic, Always Sunny</strong>: Firmly believe the market will always rise and reach new highs. QQQ at $540 will definitely be surpassed; it might reach $50,000, $500,000 in the future (a 100-fold increase is a small case in the market). 00662 might reach NT$90,000, NT$900,000 in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Volatility is Not Risk</strong>: Market decline after buying is not a risk; not being in the market is the risk. Don&rsquo;t regret not buying QQQ at $500 when it reaches $50,000.
<ul>
<li>Looking back: In 2022, when QQQ hit a low of over $200, everyone was terrified. Now it&rsquo;s over $500. The previous high of $408 was also called a high point; it was underwater for a year, and now it&rsquo;s back and hitting new highs. So what if you buy at $540 and it drops? In a few years, you&rsquo;ll be fine again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Investment Pace</strong>: Buy when you have money, invest in batches. Achieve the &ldquo;golden mean&rdquo; of being happy when it rises and comfortable when it falls (because you can buy cheaper shares).</li>
<li><strong>QQQ Performance Over the Past Year</strong>: Up 15.38%. If you haven&rsquo;t made over 10% in the past year, you&rsquo;re failing. You get this return even without active trading. Ignore recent volatility. During Trump&rsquo;s tariff war, it fell over 20%, institutions fled, and ended up missing out later. Investors who have calmly weathered the year-to-date volatility are doing great.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Student Case Background</strong>: A student (email inquiry) mentioned a short-term &ldquo;crazy 10% appreciation&rdquo; of the NTD against the USD (Teacher James pointed out it should be &ldquo;depreciation,&rdquo; but the subsequent discussion revolved around the student&rsquo;s sense of &ldquo;loss,&rdquo; suggesting the student meant NTD appreciation led to a relative drop in the NTD value of their USD assets). The student held 00864B (a USD bond ETF) and experienced a paper &ldquo;loss&rdquo; due to exchange rate changes. He also mentioned pledging over NT$30 million and borrowing NT$6.6 million (20%), which Teacher James criticized as &ldquo;courting disaster&rdquo; behavior—pledging and immediately borrowing to reinvest. A slight 10% drop in the market (referring to the value of USD assets relative to NTD) caused him to panic.</li>
<li><strong>Student&rsquo;s Questions</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Should the 00864B portion not be transferred to 00865B? (Because a transfer would mean &ldquo;immediate loss&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Will the USD continue to depreciate against the NTD? Should the money market funds remain in 00864B?</li>
<li>Can 00864B be transferred to 00662 (QQQ)?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Analysis and Criticism</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Human Fragility and Ignorance is Bliss</strong>: The student&rsquo;s behavior exposed pretending to understand, reckless bravery born of ignorance (like pledging and immediately borrowing a large sum to reinvest), and human fragility in the face of real market volatility (even currency fund exchange rate fluctuations). Like the &ldquo;Boxers&rdquo; (义和团), not learning leads to being plundered.</li>
<li><strong>Prohibition on Borrowing to Immediately Reinvest</strong>: Repeatedly emphasized that borrowing against pledged stock, especially a large one-time sum for reinvestment, is extremely dangerous.</li>
<li><strong>Short-term Exchange Rates are Unpredictable</strong>: Even the US central bank cannot predict short-term exchange rates and interest rates; investors should not worry about this. Financial media predictions are either from charlatans or liars.</li>
<li><strong>Act Immediately, Forget Sunk Costs</strong>: If a fund switch is necessary (00864B to 00865B, assuming it&rsquo;s a similar but superior fund), act immediately. Don&rsquo;t consider so-called &ldquo;losses&rdquo; or wait to &ldquo;break even.&rdquo; This is kindergarten-level financial thinking. 00864B and 00865B (if similar assets) will move mostly in tandem; waiting for one to break even means the other will have risen too.</li>
<li><strong>Severe Misconception of Risk</strong>: Being scared by a 4% paper &ldquo;loss&rdquo; in a very low-volatility money market fund (or short-term bond ETF) due to short-term exchange rate fluctuations, to the point of wanting to switch to a highly volatile stock fund (00662), is a massive risk perception error. QQQ/00662 could fall 80% within 10 years.</li>
<li><strong>Role of Cash</strong>: Cash (held in money market funds) is like the &ldquo;air force&rdquo; in a strategy, protecting ground troops (stock investments like QQQ/00662 and leveraged funds). The air force cannot be used as infantry.</li>
<li><strong>Those Unable to Bear Volatility Should Not Invest</strong>: If one cannot even bear minor exchange rate fluctuations in a money market fund (like the 10% perceived by the student) and panics because of it, then one is not suited for investing at all and should leave the market immediately, or face bankruptcy sooner or later.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term Exchange Rate Mean Reversion</strong>: In the long run (e.g., observed over 30 years), NTD exchange rate fluctuations will tend towards a mean (e.g., within a 22%-30% range up or down). As long as USD assets are held long enough (e.g., over 10 years), the expected return on USD assets (e.g., 3% annual money market yield, 34% over 10 years) far outweighs potential losses from exchange rate fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility Has Nothing to Do with Me</strong>: If this exchange rate fluctuation makes you nervous, it shows you are not suited for investing.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Requirement for Pledged Loans</strong>: When taking out stock-pledged loans, the cash (or cash equivalents) held should, under certain models, especially initially or when the market hasn&rsquo;t fallen significantly, be greater than the loan amount. Teacher James mentioned his 433 model (40% QQQ, 30% leverage, 30% cash) where, after an 80% market drop, cash might be close to or slightly less than the loan, but the overall position remains safe. If this is uncomfortable, a more conservative allocation like 424 (40% QQQ, 20% leverage, 40% cash) or 505 (50% QQQ, 50% cash, smart rebalancing) can be chosen.</li>
<li><strong>Minimum 30% Cash</strong>: At least 30% of investable assets should be allocated to cash (or money market funds). This is the first step. If you don&rsquo;t understand why you need cash, you cannot invest; you will go bankrupt.</li>
<li><strong>Cash as Living Expenses Standard</strong>: For working individuals, 30% cash should cover at least one year of living expenses. If funds are insufficient to cover one year&rsquo;s living expenses, one should not invest. Young people, after starting work, should first save a one-year emergency fund; subsequent salary can then be invested.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Horizon</strong>: Investing is a plan for 10+ years. Money needed within 10 years (e.g., children&rsquo;s tuition, down payment for a house) should not be used for high-volatility investments.</li>
<li><strong>Risks and Conditions for Buying Property</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Not recommended for young people to buy property easily, unless they have sufficient cash flow or can buy two houses as easily as buying slippers (with the mentality of buying a new pair if one breaks).</li>
<li>Concentrating investment in a single property is extremely risky (e.g., earthquake risk), violating the principle of diversification (QQQ diversifies across 100 companies).</li>
<li>The financial industry generally claims one should not concentrate bets or gamble on individual stocks, yet encourages the public to buy property (concentrated investment). This is contradictory; many practitioners either don&rsquo;t understand or are &ldquo;scammers.&rdquo; Teacher James mentioned being invited by a Taiwanese TV station to talk against buying property but declined, unwilling to become a public target.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Learn Investment Philosophy, Not Mimicry</strong>: Learn from masters like Buffett, Peter Lynch their investment philosophy (e.g., don&rsquo;t fear market volatility; Buffett encountered market drops of 10%+ annually and 20%+ every five years), not their specific stock-picking methods or asset allocation ratios. You can never mimic them.</li>
<li><strong>Cash for Retirees</strong>: Cash reserves need to cover 10+ years of expenses, ensuring that even if the market (e.g., QQQ/00662) goes to zero in an extreme scenario, and leveraged funds also go to zero, you can still live comfortably and at ease.</li>
<li><strong>Where to Keep Cash</strong>: In Taiwan, it&rsquo;s 00865B; in the US, it&rsquo;s BIL or SGOV, etc. (money market funds).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Taiwan Tax Reference</strong>: Mentioned a PDF file from Cathay United Bank regarding Taiwan taxes. Tools like ChatGPT can assist in understanding, but questions need to be logical, and AI answers are for reference only, not to be fully trusted. Teacher James stated his trained ChatGPT has not yet reached AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) level.</li>
<li><strong>Proactive Learning</strong>: When encountering problems, first search for information and learn independently. Don&rsquo;t treat Teacher James as a secretary or search engine. For example, what a money market fund is, you should look it up yourself. If you still don&rsquo;t understand after researching, you can list what you found and your confusion when asking.</li>
<li><strong>Your Biggest Enemy is Yourself</strong>: The best antidote to inner fear and greed is robust asset allocation and an ample cash level. When greedy, hold onto cash; when fearful, hold onto stocks. Asset allocation itself is to mitigate risk.</li>
<li><strong>Health and Longevity are Paramount</strong>: Health and longevity are key to achieving wealth compounding. Buffett is Buffett largely because he lived into his 90s. 96% of his wealth was earned after age 60 (a 25-fold increase in 30 years, about 11% annualized, similar to SPY). If you live that long with QQQ, your asset growth will be far more than 25 times, possibly 100 times.</li>
<li><strong>Volatility is the Entry Fee</strong>: View short-term paper &ldquo;losses&rdquo; from market volatility as an entry fee to the market, or &ldquo;withholding tax&rdquo; (it will be returned to you later), not a fine. Missing out on market upswings by not being in the market is a permanent loss (e.g., missing the 10 best days in the past 20 years might yield only 25% of the total return, while staying in the market could yield 17 times).</li>

<li>Question 1: In Canada, investing in QQQ monthly, but bank (RBC/TD) transaction fees are high (approx. 9.99 CAD/trade), which is not cost-effective for small regular investments. Asks if there are low-fee platforms?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Recommends checking the message board; some students have recommended WealthSimple or Interactive Brokers (IBKR).</li>
<li>Other student (Lin) adds: Questrade, if it&rsquo;s a self-directed account and meets asset requirements (e.g., 10,000 CAD+), might offer free trading. National Bank&rsquo;s brokerage services might also offer free trading and can link to bank accounts for direct transfers.</li>
<li>Other student (unnamed male) adds: Questrade&rsquo;s mobile trading platform might offer free commissions under certain conditions and has a regular investment feature, but specific fees need confirmation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: When buying Canadian QQQ ETFs, some are Hedged (HG), some are Non-Hedged (NH), how to choose? QQC vs QQQ selection?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: For Canadian investors, recommends buying <code>HXQ.TO</code>. It doesn&rsquo;t pay dividends (dividends are reinvested), avoiding withholding tax issues, and it&rsquo;s Hedged.</li>
<li>Other student (Lin) adds: <code>QQC.TO</code> (CAD-denominated) allows purchasing fractional shares, suitable for small regular investments (e.g., 150 CAD monthly). <code>HXQ.TO</code> (currently around 80+ CAD per share) requires whole share purchases.</li>
<li>Other student (unnamed male) adds: CAD-denominated QQC might have slightly higher gains than directly buying QQQ with USD due to currency conversion operations. Buying directly with CAD is also simpler for tax reporting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: What&rsquo;s the difference between using a brokerage platform and a bank platform for trading?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James and other students reply: Brokerage platforms are specialized investment accounts; a bank&rsquo;s investment services might be an independent department or outsourced. In Canada and the US, there&rsquo;s a firewall between brokerage and commercial banking. Using brokerage platforms directly (like Questrade, IBKR, WealthSimple) is usually more professional, and fees might be lower. Be aware that banks might try to sell packaged financial products; insist on buying pure ETFs.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: Early on (2018), saw Teacher James&rsquo;s &ldquo;One Hundred Million Dollar Investment Lecture&rdquo; on Bilibili but didn&rsquo;t think much of it. After years of ups and downs in A-shares and overseas investments (overseas funds invested for nearly 10 years without profit, until inventory at the beginning of this year). Now almost 50, feels like time was wasted. After re-encountering Teacher James&rsquo;s investment philosophy (buy when you have money, hold to death, only buy never sell), took out a portfolio loan through HSBC Hong Kong, allocating 70% QQQ, 10% TQQQ, and 20% MME (should be META). Experienced a significant market pullback in April (TQQQ dropped from purchase price near $90 to $35), but because of belief in Teacher James&rsquo;s philosophy, felt no inner turmoil, calm and composed, firmly believing volatility is not risk, and with proper asset allocation and cash reserves, there&rsquo;s nothing to fear. Studied nearly 200 of Teacher James&rsquo;s lessons, moving from understanding to faith, believing in humanity, the US, and technology, enabling steadfast holding. Teacher James is a benefactor on his investment journey.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Thanks for sharing, excellent mentality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Information on HSBC Hong Kong portfolio loans: Currently, one-month HIBOR is about 1.2%, plus the bank&rsquo;s spread, total interest is no more than 2.4%, very low. At HSBC, BIL (should be SGOV or similar short-term Treasury ETF) and leveraged funds (TQQQ, etc.) cannot be used as collateral, but SGOV can, with a loan-to-value ratio up to 90%; QQQ&rsquo;s LTV is 70%. SGOV dividends are subject to 10% withholding tax (for mainland China residents after signing W8 form), but since it&rsquo;s US Treasury interest, it&rsquo;s theoretically tax-exempt, and HSBC will refund this 10% in March/April of the following year. This method of not selling stocks, not repaying principal, and not paying interest (referring to net interest cost) through pledging is very helpful for mainland Chinese investors to avoid taxes on overseas investment income (dividends, capital gains) being investigated (recently discussed on Xueqiu), because as long as you don&rsquo;t sell, there are no realized capital gains or dividends.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: This method (not selling, pledging to borrow) is applicable to investors worldwide and can legally avoid many taxes. The key is &ldquo;buy when you have money, hold to death, never repay stock-pledged loans (principal), and borrow (through asset allocation) without paying (net) interest.&rdquo; Watson broke through the psychological barrier of &ldquo;why borrow money when I have cash,&rdquo; understanding that cash is also an asset that needs to continuously grow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: If one withdraws no more than 2% from pledged assets annually for living expenses, and this 2% is not fully used, should the remaining portion be left as is (not borrowed), or can the unused portion of the borrowed money be reinvested into the QQQ/TQQQ portfolio?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Either is fine. Reinvesting the unused portion is okay, not reinvesting is also fine; whatever makes you comfortable. If the market is falling, you can buy; if the market is rising, you can ignore it. The core is to buy when you have money, at the market price, immediately. Since you are already financially free, the extra funds just increase your inheritance, not a necessary operation.</li>

<li>Sharing: After rewatching Teacher James&rsquo;s videos, his investment philosophy has improved greatly. Fortunate to be able to jump directly from ignorance to a state of &ldquo;non-action&rdquo; (wu wei), skipping the intermediate stages of &ldquo;not knowing one is ignorant,&rdquo; &ldquo;cleverness,&rdquo; &ldquo;from non-action to action.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Question 1: Teacher James once said wealth has tiers (million for food freedom, ten million for financial freedom, one hundred million for housing freedom and helping family, one billion for helping the poor, ten billion for helping society/seeking longevity). The &ldquo;hold to death&rdquo; strategy might cause assets to fluctuate significantly between these tiers (e.g., from 100 million down to 30 million). How to psychologically overcome the feeling of falling from a higher freedom tier, even knowing it&rsquo;s temporary volatility? (For example, eating without looking at prices when assets are high, then reflecting on not being so complacent when assets fall back.)
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The key is to focus on <strong>cash flow</strong> rather than short-term fluctuations in total assets. Whether working or retired, your annual disposable cash flow should be relatively fixed (e.g., annual income 3 million, spend 1.2 million, reinvest 1.8 million), unaffected by market ups and downs. Don&rsquo;t change your spending habits because of market fluctuations. If you want to increase living expenses due to significant asset growth (e.g., from 60 million to 120 million) (e.g., from 2% of original assets to 2% of new assets, increasing cash flow from 1.2 million to 2.4 million, spending an extra 1.2 million), you should first re-evaluate and adjust your asset allocation (e.g., reduce Beta from 1.0 to lower, increase cash proportion) to ensure the new cash flow plan is sustainable. After that, your life should no longer be affected by market volatility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Why is the rebalancing frequency chosen as once a year? (Saw an author who tried different frequencies and concluded there&rsquo;s no optimum, once a year is about right.)
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Once a year is based on intuition and common sense. Two years is too long, volatility might be too great, reducing rebalancing efficiency (e.g., if it rises 50% this year, annual rebalancing is efficient; over two years, volatility might be smoothed out, reducing efficiency). Daily rebalancing is theoretically most efficient but impractical (becomes short-term trading) and incurs high transaction costs and tax issues. Once a year strikes a good balance between efficiency and practicability, and also aligns well with tax reporting (e.g., in the US).</li>

<li>Sharing: Observed that the market mostly rises slowly (e.g., 0.x% daily, leveraged funds 1.x%), but when it falls (e.g., president talks about trade war), the decline is larger (5%, 10%, 20%). This is like life, mostly mundane daily routines, but long-term accumulation (power of compounding) can lead to huge changes. Work hard, live well, and you can ultimately lead a happy life.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Well said. Plainness is a blessing, safety first, stable profits. Without safety, everything else is false; without health, everything else is false. Health and safety are prerequisites for enjoying wealth. Like the example of Bill Gates (or Steve Jobs), his high school had an expensive computer (a one-in-ten-thousand chance of luck), and he learned programming; but another equally talented classmate unfortunately died while mountain climbing (a one-in-ten-thousand chance of disaster).

Warren Buffett, though 94 years old (born 1930) and having experienced WWII and countless storms, repeatedly emphasized four or five times within three to four hours how lucky he was to be born in America as a white male. This echoes Teacher James&rsquo;s emphasis on &ldquo;always be optimistic, embrace the sunshine.&rdquo; If I hadn&rsquo;t listened to Teacher James&rsquo;s classes, I might not have understood Buffett&rsquo;s expression and would have found it insincere. Now I understand; he certainly had bad things happen in his life, but he chose optimism.

<li>Sharing 1: Before and after attending the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting, encountered two groups of people: one group was value investors like Li Lu, who emphasized ignoring market volatility (Mr. Market&rsquo;s emotions), believing index investing is also a form of value investing (natural growth of the economy after removing speculation). They also emphasized community support, making an annual &ldquo;pilgrimage&rdquo; to Omaha.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: The other group was insurance agents, also using Buffett&rsquo;s theories (Berkshire Hathaway has insurance business), discussing asset management, inheritance, financial literacy education (e.g., allocating 401k, Roth IRA), but their ultimate goal was to sell life insurance.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Be wary of insurance agents. Insurance is transferring your money to the insurance company&rsquo;s pocket; it&rsquo;s essentially &ldquo;the scam group within the financial scam conglomerate.&rdquo; Buffett says insurance is a good business—for the insurance company, not for the policyholder. Insurance agents use financial literacy education as a disguise, making it highly deceptive.</li>

<li>Question: Taiwanese products offer good value for money (e.g., Meet Fresh is $10 in the US, Taiwan has many cheaper options), but the NTD seems undervalued. If the NTD appreciates significantly in the future as Teacher James suggested (e.g., from 30:1 USD to 15:1 or even 10:1), for Taiwanese investors in US stock ETFs (like 00662, with an annualized return of about 12-14%), will their long-term returns denominated in NTD be eroded by exchange rates, leading to less-than-expected growth in purchasing power? (A boss&rsquo;s mentality might be to hope for NTD depreciation to benefit exports, sacrificing employee welfare).
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>NTD appreciation is good for Taiwan. It will be cheaper for people to buy imported goods (e.g., iPhone from NT$30,000 to NT$10,000) and travel abroad, improving quality of life. High-pollution, uncompetitive industries (like uncompetitive steel, unless for national defense) will naturally be eliminated; they shouldn&rsquo;t be subsidized by sacrificing public welfare and the environment.</li>
<li>For Taiwanese investors already invested in USD assets, NTD appreciation will indeed affect NTD-denominated returns. However, one can consider allocating to some NTD-hedged ETFs (like Taiwan&rsquo;s 00670L Fubon NASDAQ Leveraged 2x, although it&rsquo;s a leveraged ETF, Teacher James might be referring to its hedging characteristic here or using it as an example that such tools exist).</li>
<li>In the long run, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations is far less than the growth of quality assets. Even if the annualized return drops from 14% to 7% due to exchange rates, it&rsquo;s still a good return. One shouldn&rsquo;t worry excessively about exchange rates.</li>
<li>After NTD appreciation, buying USD assets in the future will be cheaper (e.g., QQQ from NT$15,000 to NT$5,000), which is actually beneficial. An undervalued NTD deprives the entire population of welfare to benefit a few manufacturers.</li>

<li>Question: Regarding Roth portions in tax-deferred retirement accounts like 403(b) and 457(b) (up to $30,500 can be contributed annually), are they also subject to Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) at age 73 or 75? If so, can they be rolled over tax-free to a personal Roth IRA account without an amount limit? What are the precautions during operation (e.g., need to sell then transfer)?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Funds in Roth 403(b)/457(b), after meeting conditions, can be rolled over tax-free to a personal Roth IRA. This avoids RMD issues because personal Roth IRAs do not have RMDs during the owner&rsquo;s lifetime. Operationally, contact the brokerage to handle it; you can choose cash transfer or in-kind transfer (assets transferred directly, if the brokerage supports it and the investment holdings are the same, like QQQ). It&rsquo;s advisable to choose the brokerage link option within 403(b)/457(b) as much as possible to invest in quality targets like QQQ, rather than being limited to a few poor-performing funds offered by the plan. If you can only choose funds, don&rsquo;t contribute; deposit directly into a Roth IRA.</li>

<li>Question: Regarding Pledged Line of Credit (PLOC), a friend doesn&rsquo;t understand why one would borrow money and pay interest when having enough cash or stock gains. How to simply explain its benefits? (Friend&rsquo;s argument: I have money from stock trading, why borrow and pay interest?)
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Capital Efficiency and Compounding</strong>: Using your own money for living expenses (e.g., spending $20,000 annually) means reducing the principal available for investment. Borrowing for living expenses (e.g., borrowing $20,000) allows the original principal (e.g., $1 million) to continue growing at a higher rate (e.g., 10%). Even after paying interest (e.g., 5%), there&rsquo;s still a net gain (5% arbitrage). After 30 years, the borrower&rsquo;s net worth (total assets minus debt) will be far higher than that of the investor who spends their own money (Teacher James gave an example, the former has $3 million more).</li>
<li><strong>Tax Advantages</strong>: Not selling stocks means no capital gains tax.</li>
<li><strong>Possibility of Interest Deduction</strong>: Interest on loans may be tax-deductible under specific circumstances (e.g., treating long-term capital gains as short-term, forgoing preferential tax rates) (complex operation, consult a professional accountant; many accountants don&rsquo;t understand this).</li>
<li><strong>Net Interest Cost is Zero or Negative</strong>: Through proper asset allocation (like Teacher James&rsquo;s 433 model: 40% QQQ, 30% QLD/TQQQ, 30% cash/money market fund), the interest generated by money market funds (e.g., $300,000 cash generating 4.5% or $13,500 interest) can cover or even exceed the interest expense of pledged loans (e.g., borrowing $200,000, 5% interest is $10,000), achieving &ldquo;borrowing money without paying interest&rdquo; or even making money, while the portfolio&rsquo;s Beta remains at 1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term Asset Growth and Risk (Counter-intuitive)</strong>: Over the long term, the total assets of an investor who borrows will be far higher than one who spends their own money. Continuously spending principal leads to principal depletion (e.g., $1 million becomes $400,000 after 30 years, then $100,000 after another 10 years, unable to afford a bento box). Borrowing and letting the principal grow continuously, even with debt, results in better sustainability of total assets (still $1 million principal growing) and cash flow, thus lower risk.
Teacher James emphasized this is one of his core strategies, requiring students to watch the videos from the beginning to fully understand.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Market volatility has nothing to do with us, so don&rsquo;t sell stocks, don&rsquo;t sell stocks, don&rsquo;t sell stocks.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view is a core investment discipline repeatedly emphasized by Teacher James: maintain composure in the face of market volatility and stick to the strategy of long-term holding of quality assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You only run into problems if you are afraid. If you sell your stocks, always remember one thing: keep enough cash. Retirees might need to keep 10-15 years&rsquo; worth, at least 30% or more in cash.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Teacher James stresses the importance of ample cash reserves for overcoming fear and avoiding erroneous operations, providing cash reserve suggestions for different groups of people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greed and fear are like that. Because you feel the market, it causes your greed&hellip; you find your assets have exploded&hellip; you&rsquo;re about to become a superior person, then greed has appeared, and risk will follow. When the market drops, you become very fearful, very fearful, very fearful&hellip; then this fear emerges.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Profoundly reveals the common extreme emotions of investors in the market and their dangers, reminding investors to remain rational.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cash is air. You must maintain the highest level of cash to survive. In the overall strategy, cash is like the air force, protecting the ground troops from annihilation.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uses a vivid metaphor to emphasize the strategic position of cash in an investment portfolio, as key to resisting risk and ensuring survival.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our method isn&rsquo;t just for China; even if you&rsquo;re in Taiwan or the US, you don&rsquo;t need to pay taxes because we don&rsquo;t sell. No selling means no taxes. Learn this trick: stock pledge loans are never repaid (principal), and the loan (through asset allocation) incurs no (net) interest.
&ndash; Teacher James (partially echoing Watson&rsquo;s sharing)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Explains the strategy of achieving tax optimization and wealth growth through long-term holding, not selling, and skillfully using stock pledge loans (combined with asset allocation to make interest costs manageable).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You just need to be optimistic, optimistic, I am great, I am good, I am very rich, all the money in the world is mine. You need to chant this every day: I am great, I am good. I am the best person in the world. That&rsquo;s enough. All good luck will come to you.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasizes the importance of positive psychological suggestion and an optimistic mindset for investment and even life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When investing, you must treat the losses brought by volatility, these temporary losses, as the entry fee for the market, not a fine.
&ndash; Teacher James (quoting an online viewpoint)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Provides a positive perspective on market volatility and short-term paper losses, helping investors maintain a long-term mindset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We make money without paying taxes, borrow money without paying (net) interest, and we hold to death, never selling (principal). This is our highest realm.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summarizes the ideal state of his investment strategy, emphasizing tax efficiency, cost control, and long-term holding.</p>

<p>In this lecture, Teacher James once again systematically emphasized his core investment philosophy: long-term holding of quality assets (like the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund), ignoring short-term market volatility and noise, maintaining sufficient cash reserves, and applying a reasonable asset allocation strategy. Teacher James sternly refuted panic and erroneous operations arising from short-term market or exchange rate fluctuations and detailed the correct use of stock pledge loans where &ldquo;principal is never repaid, and (net) interest is controllable.&rdquo; Through questions and sharing from multiple students, the lecture covered specific concerns of investors from different regions including Canada, Mainland China, Taiwan, and the US, touching upon brokerage selection, fees, tax planning, retirement account management, and overcoming psychological investment barriers. Teacher James consistently conveyed an extremely optimistic investment belief and reminded investors to be wary of financial scams, focus on learning correct investment knowledge, and ultimately achieve financial freedom and life happiness.</p>

<p>The market is always fluctuating; this is normal. Investors should have a long-term perspective, ignoring short-term volatility and market noise (such as international situations, economic analysis, financial reports, etc.). The core strategy is to hold high-quality index funds (such as QQQ) for the long term, and to make reasonable asset allocation (including cash reserves) based on individual risk tolerance, while overcoming the greed and fear of human nature. Learning and building a firm belief are essential.</p>

<li><strong>Market volatility is normal</strong>: A 10% market drop is normal, 20% happens about every two or three years, and 50% may happen every five to ten years. This is like the tides, wind, rain, and earthquakes in nature; it&rsquo;s an inevitable natural phenomenon. Don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;this year is different&rdquo;; every year is the same.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of a long-term perspective</strong>: As long as you stay in the market long enough, you will understand that there is nothing new in the market. The core laws of the market are &ldquo;always rising&rdquo; and &ldquo;always fluctuating.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Ignore the noise</strong>: Market fluctuations, international situations, market analysis, financial reports, and economic situations are all irrelevant to the decisions of long-term investors.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended strategy</strong>: Hold the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ) for the long term; it can be bought worldwide. This is the simplest and most effective strategy.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learning to build belief</strong>: Investing is simple (buy index funds), but there are many external distractions (monsters and ghosts). You need to build firm belief and willpower through learning, so that you will not be easily swayed by other people&rsquo;s opinions.</li>
<li><strong>Overcoming human weaknesses</strong>: Greed and fear are the biggest enemies of investment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Manifestations of greed</strong>: Chasing high when the market rises, thinking that the opportunity to &ldquo;buy the dip&rdquo; has come when the market falls, and using up all cash too early (e.g., constantly adding positions when the market has just fallen 5%-13%).</li>
<li><strong>Manifestations of fear</strong>: Not daring to buy when the market rises, only FOMOing (fear of missing out) All-in when it has risen too much; panicking when the market falls and selling at a loss at the bottom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Importance of cash</strong>: Ample cash is a magic weapon to overcome human nature (especially fear), as important as air. It makes you feel comfortable and secure when the market falls. Don&rsquo;t exhaust your cash when the market just starts to fall.</li>
<li><strong>Living in the present</strong>: Don&rsquo;t dwell on past mistakes (such as losses in real estate investment), don&rsquo;t worry too much about future uncertainties, focus on the present, and do your current investment and learning well.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finding the comfort zone</strong>: Everyone has a different risk tolerance. You need to find your comfortable asset allocation ratio through market fluctuations (such as 442, 433, 523, 514, 505, etc.), and the cash ratio is very important. If you feel uncomfortable when the market falls, you should adjust to a configuration that you can hold with peace of mind during rebounds.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage risk</strong>: Few people can withstand fluctuations of more than 1.2 times Beta. When the market falls, many people will not be able to stand it and reduce leverage. Don&rsquo;t be overconfident in adding leverage when the market is good.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Some people went from 442 to 0.9x leverage or even lower.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rebalancing</strong>: It is recommended to do rebalancing once a year. Only use a small amount of cash (e.g., 2% per year) to buy if the market is down at the end of the year. Don&rsquo;t operate frequently or exhaust your cash due to monthly or short-term declines.</li>
<li><strong>About full-position leverage</strong>: It is not recommended for young people to use &ldquo;full-position two-times leverage,&rdquo; because there will always be a big bubble in life. High leverage may lead to a significant asset drawdown (e.g., falling to 0.1), which is difficult to recover, and you may reach your goal later than with a stable investment.</li>
<li><strong>Tortoise and hare</strong>: A stable configuration (tortoise) will outperform an aggressive high-leverage strategy (hare) in the long run. Even if the Beta is lower than 1, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose of secured borrowing</strong>: The purpose of secured borrowing is not to pursue extreme returns, but to meet living needs or make better configurations while holding high-quality assets for the long term. The risk lies in the ability to repay the principal, not the interest burden.</li>

</li>
<li><strong>Interpretation</strong>: It&rsquo;s like a person having 1.68 million in assets (and the assets are growing at a rate of about 10%), 1.02 million in debt (of which 360,000 is core debt), and an annual salary of 280,000 (which is also growing). The debt is controllable, and the risk of bankruptcy is very low. U.S. dollar cash itself is also a liability, but it will depreciate with inflation, reducing the actual repayment pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Interest problem</strong>: Federal debt interest expenditure is about 1T, which is controllable relative to federal tax revenue (about 4.9T + state tax) and GDP (28T). There is no need to worry too much about the so-called interest exceeding defense spending (about 0.9T), as this comparison is not meaningful.</li>
<li><strong>Clarification of Musk&rsquo;s views</strong>: Musk mainly criticized the <strong>inefficiency and waste</strong> of the U.S. government&rsquo;s spending, rather than the debt itself being unsustainable.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of tariffs</strong>: Raising tariffs essentially shifts costs to consumers, leading to rising prices, which is equivalent to a disguised tax. This is just a different form from directly collecting federal taxes (paying in installments in daily consumption vs. paying once a year). The impact on the overall economy is complex, but for individuals, it may just be &ldquo;shifting from the left pocket to the right pocket.&rdquo;</li>

<li><strong>Retirement Planning Case (Student Question)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>NT$15 million in funds + NT$5 million in financial-type mortgage.</li>
<li>Suggestion: For the part that needs cash flow, consider buying ETFs such as 0050/0056 that provide dividends, but be aware that their dividends may include principal (selling component stocks).</li>
<li>Investment of NT$15 million: If you don&rsquo;t need to withdraw money from it, you can consider leveraged allocation (such as 433); if you need to withdraw money, you cannot use leverage. Choose the allocation based on the withdrawal rate (the amount needed after deducting Social Security benefits) (e.g., 2% withdrawal with 80/20 QQQ/cash; 3% withdrawal with SPY). The withdrawal rate is key, not the traditional 4% rule.</li>
<li>Core: Any configuration must consider whether you can withstand a 50% market drop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tesla FSD Experience (Student and Teacher Sharing)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>FSD V12 is amazing, close to fully autonomous driving, able to handle complex road conditions (such as San Francisco), and significantly reduces driving stress and fatigue.</li>
<li>FSD has a certain &ldquo;perception&rdquo; ability and can judge the intentions of other vehicles/pedestrians and make intelligent reactions.</li>
<li>Value: The teacher believes that FSD is worth the money (willing to spend $100,000 to buy it), improves safety (saves lives), improves the driving experience (reduces family quarrels), and may even reduce insurance premiums (using Tesla Insurance). Strongly recommends buying a Tesla car with FSD (the new Model Y comes standard). Use the teacher&rsquo;s referral code for discounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Consumption Concepts and Family (Student Question)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Problem: Family members (such as spouses, parents) continue to demand new car replacements and other consumption due to &ldquo;laborer thinking&rdquo; or material needs, which conflicts with their own goals of accumulating wealth, and they feel annoyed.</li>
<li>Teacher&rsquo;s suggestion:
<ul>
<li>Understand the needs and feelings of family members (love what they love).</li>
<li>Learn to &ldquo;consume smartly,&rdquo; using financial tools (such as secured loans, adjusting allocation ratios) to meet some reasonable needs without excessively affecting the growth of core investments. For example, sell 100,000 QQQ, exchange it for 50,000 QLD (keeping some exposure) + 50,000 cash to buy a car.</li>
<li>The goal of capitalists is to make money generate money and ultimately use it to improve the quality of life, not just to save money. Find a balance between accumulation and consumption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Technology Product Consumption</strong>: The teacher shared that buying high-quality displays (Nano-texture display) and AirPods Pro 2 (with hearing aid function, about $249) is to protect health and improve the quality of life. These investments are worthwhile, and financial operations (such as secured loans, credit card rebates reinvestment) can be used to make them feel like &ldquo;no money is spent.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Defining Purchasing Power</strong>: True purchasing power means that when the purchased items (such as houses and cars) are accidentally damaged, you have the ability to easily buy another one without feeling financial pressure or heartache. Otherwise, you are exceeding your consumption capacity.</li>

<li>Sharing: Often explains to friends that market fluctuations are normal and not to panic. Also dissuaded friends from borrowing too much to invest just because their income could afford the interest.
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Reviewed his 16-year investment journey: early purchases of 0050/0056 -&gt; chasing biotech stocks (heavy losses) -&gt; starting to invest in U.S. stocks (VOO/VTI/bonds, diversified) after the pandemic -&gt; epiphany after listening to the course, and is now concentrating assets into QQQ. Realized that dividends (0056) are not as good as total return (0050), paying off the mortgage too early was a wrong decision, and the cost of time is terrible.</li>
<li>Question 1: Should asset allocation (such as 442/433) be achieved on all accounts (Taiwan, US Brokerage, IRA, Roth 401k, etc.) as a whole, or should each account follow?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: All accounts should be regarded as a whole for allocation. Leveraged funds (such as QLD) can only be placed in tax-free growth Roth accounts. Cash can be placed in Brokerage or Traditional IRA/401k (doing so can slow down the growth of pre-tax accounts, which is beneficial for future taxes). The final Beta value will be limited by the size of the Roth account. Even if the Beta is lower than 1, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Stability (tortoise) may outperform aggression (hare).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: There are historical contributions in Traditional 401k (mutual funds have been converted to QQQ), and now it is a mix of Roth and Traditional. Should the Traditional portion be converted to Roth?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Whether to convert depends on the amount and current tax rate. If the amount is not large, you can convert it all at once. If the amount is large (e.g., 500,000), in order to avoid high tax burdens, it should be converted over many years. You can use the Investment Calculator to calculate how much amount to convert each year to reduce the Traditional balance to zero within a set period (e.g., 10 years) while controlling the annual tax burden. Fidelity clearly distinguishes the shares of Roth and Traditional internally.</li>

Is there a good way to deal with it?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Understanding and love</strong>: Understand the needs of family members and love them (love what they love). Meeting reasonable needs is part of maintaining family harmony.</li>
<li><strong>Smart consumption</strong>: Capitalists don&rsquo;t not consume, but consume smartly. Use financial tools (secured loans, adjusting investment portfolios such as selling QQQ for QLD + cash) to meet consumption needs as much as possible without affecting the compound growth of core assets.</li>
<li><strong>Balance</strong>: Find a balance between wealth accumulation and enjoyment of life. It is not necessary to meet all requirements, but it is not possible to completely reject them. It is necessary to meet one or two needs that family members value every year or every few years.</li>
<li><strong>No need to explain too much</strong>: Actions speak louder than words. Express love through practical actions (such as buying a car), but there is no need to argue too much about concepts.</li>

<li>Sharing: Describes a complex arbitrage strategy: Using secured borrowing (leverage may exceed 1.5 times), puts some funds into a digital account in Taiwan (about 2% interest), and buys 00864B (USD money market fund) to try to cover the 2.8% borrowing cost. Also shared how to use credit card payments to get 0% interest installments and then use the money to buy 00864B for arbitrage.</li>
<li>Question: Is this operation feasible? Does it conform to the 442 configuration idea?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Not 442</strong>: What you described is an arbitrage strategy, not the 442 asset allocation based on long-term growth that we discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Arbitrage efficiency</strong>: Putting borrowed money (cost 2.8%) into a NTD account with 2% interest is losing money. All of it should be put into 00864B with higher returns (about 4.5%) and matching currencies (USD) for arbitrage. Exchange rate fluctuations are not important.</li>
<li><strong>Credit card arbitrage</strong>: It is feasible to use 0% interest installments for arbitrage, but it is a &ldquo;sesame green bean&rdquo; small trick and should not be distracted too much.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Experienced the 2008 financial crisis, assets were halved, and since then has attached importance to cash, maintaining 30-40% cash all year round. Dared to buy in when the market fell sharply in 2022 and made a profit at the end of the year.</li>
<li>Question 1: Made considerable profits last year and early this year and wanted to sell some at a high level to avoid a callback, but her husband prevented it because of concerns about high taxes (believing that it would push the tax bracket to 50%). How to deal with it?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Her husband&rsquo;s understanding of tax law is wrong. Long-term Capital Gain Tax is calculated separately from ordinary income tax. Its tax rate is tiered (usually 0%, 15%, 20%), and the highest is 20% (plus a possible 3.8% NIIT). Selling capital gains will not push ordinary income to an extremely high tax bracket (such as 50%). The tax rate for selling a lot of LTCG is basically fixed (it is 20% after reaching a certain amount). However, it is not recommended to time the market to sell. If you really want to operate, you should prioritize doing so in retirement accounts (such as IRA/401k). Selling has no immediate tax impact, and you can even buy reverse ETFs (such as SQQQ) for hedging in retirement accounts (advanced operation, not recommended).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Is it better to buy dividend-paying stocks or other things with the cash (Money Market) held? Worried about the tax on dividend-paying stocks.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Don&rsquo;t use dividend-paying stocks to hold cash, the tax efficiency is low. You should use money market funds. If you want to avoid both federal and state taxes, you can consider municipal bond funds (Muni Bond Fund, such as Vanguard&rsquo;s VOOX). If you only consider federal tax, you can use U.S. Treasury money market funds (such as SGOV, BIL). There is a capital gains tax problem only when selling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: I want to anonymously sponsor a talented child (a friend&rsquo;s child, with decent family conditions), but I don&rsquo;t want the other party to know now, how to operate? Worried about tax issues.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Anonymous operation is difficult, especially involving opening an account. And the other party&rsquo;s family may not need sponsorship. A safer way is to write this child (providing name, address, and other information) into your own trust file as a beneficiary of future inheritance. This operation is simple and usually tax-free.</li>

<li>Question 1: In the United States, in addition to mortgage loans and stock pledges, what other similar low-cost sources of funds can be used like &ldquo;Han Xin counting soldiers&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: The U.S. financial market is highly efficient and has a lot of &ldquo;smart money,&rdquo; so the interest rate on unsecured personal loans is usually higher (such as 8% +). Unlike Taiwan, which has a large amount of low-cost funds (due to export-oriented currency abundance), there are indeed not many other low-cost, flexible sources of funds besides stock pledges (Pledge Loan). If you have channels in Taiwan to borrow low-interest NTD funds, you can consider it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Regarding children&rsquo;s college tuition fees, is it better for them to apply for student loans themselves (and we will use the pledged money to pay them back after graduation), or to pay directly with the pledged money? Which is better?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: There is no absolute right or wrong, it depends on the child&rsquo;s personality and feelings. If the child feels stressed about debt, pay directly. If the child understands financial leverage and the student loan conditions are favorable (such as interest only after graduation), you can let them take out the loan and the parents will pay it back later. The key is to communicate well with the child. The teacher shared his experience of paying his daughter&rsquo;s tuition fees directly.</li>
</ul>

<li>Sharing: Fortunate to have followed the teacher&rsquo;s advice to sell the expensive house in Los Angeles and exchange it for a cheaper one and use a pledge loan. Now I feel relaxed, unlike some friends who are trapped in expensive houses and facing difficulties under the wave of layoffs.

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Concerns about U.S. Treasury bonds (such as the debt-to-GDP ratio, interest burden), is it possible that the world will stop buying U.S. bonds?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: U.S. assets (168T) far exceed debt (federal debt 36T). The interest burden is controllable relative to fiscal revenue and GDP. Countries around the world hold a large amount of USD reserves and must purchase USD assets (government bonds, treasury bills, money market funds, etc.) to store them. There are no other large-scale options to replace them. Therefore, the world will not stop buying U.S. bonds. A strong U.S. dollar is in the best interest of the United States.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: The price of SGOV (short-term treasury bond ETF) is rising slightly every day, while the price of TLT (long-term treasury bond ETF) has been falling recently, why?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: SGOV tracks short-term interest rates. Its mechanism is to accrue interest accumulation daily and the net value returns after dividends, showing a step-like slight oscillation. TLT represents long-term treasury bonds, and its price (yield) mainly reflects the market&rsquo;s <strong>expectations for future long-term inflation</strong>. If the market expects inflation to rise in the future (for example, worrying about tariffs leading to inflation), the yield on long-term treasury bonds will rise and the price of TLT will fall. This has little to do with the Fed&rsquo;s current short-term interest rate policy.</li>

<p>In this CLEC investment and financial management sharing session, James reiterated the core philosophy of long-term investment: embrace market volatility, adhere to holding index funds represented by QQQ, and build firm belief through continuous learning. The teacher analyzed the real situation of U.S. Treasury bonds in detail, believing that there is no need to worry too much, and clarified the misunderstanding about its interest burden and Musk&rsquo;s criticism. At the same time, it discussed the rational use of leverage, the importance of cash reserves (like air and magic weapons), and how to overcome psychological biases in investment. The Q&amp;A session involved asset allocation across accounts, Roth conversion, real estate processing (including Canadian non-resident tax issues and personal experience), children&rsquo;s education funding planning, the excellent value and experience of Tesla FSD, consumption concept balance (smart consumption vs. laborer thinking), the limited sources of low-cost funds in the United States, the driving factor differences between long-term and short-term treasury bond ETFs, and the correct understanding of U.S. long-term capital gains tax and other practical issues, providing specific operational suggestions and thinking frameworks. The core message is to maintain a long-term perspective, make rational decisions, use financial tools to achieve a balance between wealth growth and quality of life, while understanding and respecting the needs of the people around you.</p>
