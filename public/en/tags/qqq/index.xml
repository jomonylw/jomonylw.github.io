      <description>In this session, Teacher James delves into how investors can evolve from &amp;#39;lower animals&amp;#39; susceptible to market volatility into &amp;#39;higher animals&amp;#39; capable of navigating bull and bear markets. The core concept revolves around the belief in &amp;#39;buy, hold, never sell,&amp;#39; emphasizing the importance of asset allocation and risk management. Additionally, the session provides a detailed analysis of the proper use and specific parameters of asset activation tools like HELOCs, reverse mortgages, and securities-based loans. Drawing on the wisdom of &amp;#39;The Bible of Financial Management,&amp;#39; it explains the fundamental philosophy for achieving financial freedom.</description>

<p>The core theme of this session is the <strong>evolution of investors</strong>. Teacher James compares investors to biological organisms, proposing that they need to evolve from &ldquo;single-celled lower animals,&rdquo; easily eliminated by market fluctuations, into &ldquo;higher animals&rdquo; capable of withstanding any market environment. This evolution is achieved by learning the correct investment philosophy and risk management. The key to this transformation is a firm belief that the market will rise in the long term, adopting a &ldquo;buy, hold, never sell&rdquo; strategy, and establishing an asset allocation that can withstand extreme risks (such as a market drop of 80% lasting for 10 years).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Belief is Paramount</strong>: The market has no peak; it only goes higher. It won&rsquo;t hit a ceiling; it will only rise ceaselessly. Investors should ignore external analysis and short-term market turmoil because no analysis can beat the power of &ldquo;holding shares and doing nothing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>The Ultimate Strategy</strong>: The simplest strategy is the most effective—buy, hold, and never sell. As long as you do this, you will become wealthy.</li>
<li><strong>Future Outlook</strong>: QQQ is now near 600, will soon reach 1000, and in the future, we will see 6,000, and even 60,000. Human progress is limitless, and the market&rsquo;s growth has no ceiling.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Extinction of Lower Animals</strong>: The vast majority of investors in the market are &ldquo;single-celled&rdquo; or &ldquo;lower animals.&rdquo; They have not been tempered by the harsh market environment and lack the ability to cope with extreme risks. Therefore, in every financial crisis (such as the 1996 Asian Financial Crisis, the 2000 Dot-com Bubble, and the 2008 Subprime Mortgage Crisis), these &ldquo;species&rdquo; are wiped out in batches.</li>
<li><strong>Survival Principles of Higher Animals</strong>: Becoming a &ldquo;higher animal&rdquo; means possessing an investment system that has been tested over the long term and is capable of evolving. The core lies in truly understanding risk and building an asset allocation that can withstand the worst-case scenario (a market drop of 80% lasting for 10 years).</li>
<li><strong>CLEC&rsquo;s Positioning</strong>: The philosophy and system of our channel are a &ldquo;higher animal&rdquo; system, tested and evolved over 40 years in the market. We directly elevate our students to the highest level of investing, allowing them to avoid the fate of &ldquo;slaughter&rdquo; and &ldquo;extinction&rdquo; at the bottom of the market. We are not engaging in a brutal &ldquo;Normandy Landing&rdquo; battle; instead, we are &ldquo;taking the elevator&rdquo; directly to the Mount Everest of wealth.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) vs. Reverse Mortgage</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>HELOC</strong>: Suitable for young people with stable jobs. It poses a risk for retirees without a steady income, as the bank may require principal and interest payments after a few years. If the market is down at that time, it will create immense cash flow pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Mortgage</strong>: More suitable for older individuals without a stable salary. It converts real estate into a steady monthly cash flow, significantly enhancing the security of retirement life. This money can be used for living expenses or reinvested, making it an effective way to activate property assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advantages and Red Lines of Securities-Based Lending (Pledging Stocks)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage</strong>: The process is convenient and can be done with a few clicks, without needing the bank&rsquo;s approval.</li>
<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: Strict risk control and asset allocation are mandatory. The amount you can borrow is linked to your cash ratio:
<ul>
<li><strong>30% Cash</strong>: Can use <strong>2%-3%</strong> of assets annually.</li>
<li><strong>40% Cash</strong>: Can use <strong>3%-4%</strong> of assets annually.</li>
<li><strong>50% Cash</strong>: Can use <strong>4%-5%</strong> of assets annually.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Serious Warning (for U.S. Investors)</strong>: In the United States, it is <strong>absolutely forbidden</strong> to reinvest money borrowed from a securities-based loan back into a securities account. This is a serious violation. If discovered, the lending privileges may be revoked, and immediate repayment may be demanded, leading to a financial catastrophe. Regulations in Taiwan permit reinvestment, but it is strictly prohibited in the U.S.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Principles for Using Credit Loans</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Short-term credit loans should be repaid with a stable salary to ensure healthy cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of the &ldquo;High Dividends Covering Loan Interest&rdquo; Trap</strong>: Many experts advocate taking out loans to buy high-dividend products. While the dividend yield (e.g., 7%) may seem higher than the loan interest rate (e.g., 3%), they ignore that repayment requires both &ldquo;principal and interest.&rdquo; The dividend alone cannot cover the monthly payment, which can easily lead to a cash flow crisis.</li>
<li><strong>Example of Flexible Use</strong>: For instance, if you need $100,000 to buy a car, you could apply for a credit loan of $800,000. Use $100,000 for the car payment and invest the remaining $700,000. Later, you can use a securities-based loan from your investment portfolio, borrowing 2% annually to help repay the car loan, thus achieving more efficient use of your assets.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Divide Between the Rich and the Poor</strong>: A key factor distinguishing the two is whether they have been taught the correct concepts of financial management. Wealth is a &ldquo;natural gift&rdquo; that everyone can possess.</li>
<li><strong>The Essence of Investing</strong>: Investing is not a field where more diligent research leads to better performance. The key is having the right direction and a deep understanding, after which it becomes &ldquo;autopilot.&rdquo; 99.99% of external information is not worth listening to.</li>
<li><strong>The Prerequisite for Wealth</strong>: You must invest your assets in high-return targets. This is why we choose QQQ, not SPY or VT, because the latter&rsquo;s returns will make you relatively &ldquo;poorer.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>CLEC&rsquo;s Mission</strong>: If the government wants to narrow the wealth gap, it should instill the correct financial management concepts in the public. This is precisely what CLEC is doing. We are committed to financial investment education as our social mission.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: I found at today&rsquo;s seminar that the biggest problem for most people is that they &ldquo;can&rsquo;t hold on.&rdquo; This might be due to being stuck by certain &ldquo;limiting beliefs.&rdquo; I suggest that when you are still a &ldquo;seedling,&rdquo; you should not discuss our philosophy with outsiders who don&rsquo;t understand it. They will only tell you to &ldquo;take profits&rdquo; or &ldquo;stop loss.&rdquo; Regardless of whether the market goes up or down, the external environment is not conducive to long-term holding. If you have questions, you should come back and ask the teacher or the &ldquo;higher animals&rdquo; in the community.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Absolutely correct. We are the &ldquo;higher animals&rdquo; of investing. Isn&rsquo;t it ridiculous for a higher animal to ask a lower animal for a prescription? It&rsquo;s like a Rolls-Royce owner asking a financial advisor who rides a motorcycle or takes the bus for financial advice. Your circle determines your cognition. If you have questions, you must come back and ask those who have already made big money in this market.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: I am very excited that my family (son, daughter-in-law) and I have all joined the CLEC family. I believe it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;treasure trove&rdquo;—the more people who join, the more treasure there is, rather than a cake that gets smaller as it&rsquo;s divided.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: I reviewed the videos where the teacher talked about &ldquo;risk management&rdquo; and &ldquo;the person hiding in the cave&rdquo; (session 00523). I think they are incredibly valuable and have listened to them many times. I&rsquo;ve realized that to become truly wealthy, one needs to experience several bear markets to achieve a state of inner calm.</li>
<li>Sharing 3: Regarding the teacher&rsquo;s comment that &ldquo;whether you leave 20% or 30% cash in the end is not important,&rdquo; my understanding is that it depends on the size of one&rsquo;s total assets. For someone with assets of 1 billion, leaving 5% cash might be enough to live on for 20 years.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your understanding of the cash ratio is correct. The core idea is to calculate how many years your remaining cash can support your lifestyle; we typically use 10-15 years as a benchmark. For example, with 30% cash, if you use 2% per year, it will last 15 years; if you use 3% per year, it will last 10 years. The teacher also praised Bruce&rsquo;s proactive learning attitude, believing he will definitely succeed.</li>

<li>Questions (Canadian Investor):
<ol>
<li>In my IBKR account, is it correct to directly buy HXQ (the Canadian version of QQQ) in Canadian dollars as my core fund?</li>
<li>For the cash portion, I want to buy a non-dividend-paying Money Market fund. I could only find HSAV to buy with Canadian dollars, but its price fluctuates, which I don&rsquo;t quite understand. Should I convert to USD and buy BOXX instead?</li>
<li>Someone reminded me that Canadians holding U.S. assets face estate tax issues. What are your thoughts on this?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ol>
<li>Buying HXQ with Canadian dollars is correct.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s recommended to convert most of your cash (e.g., 25% of total assets) to USD and buy BOXX, as it has a higher interest rate and is non-dividend-paying, which avoids tax complications. At the same time, keep a small portion (e.g., 5%) of Canadian dollar cash in a Canadian money market fund for emergencies.</li>
<li>Estate tax is a valid concern, but it can be effectively managed by opening a &ldquo;Joint Account.&rdquo; Since you have already opened a joint account with your husband, you don&rsquo;t need to worry too much about this issue. For leveraged funds, Canada&rsquo;s QQU and TQQQ.TO are also usable options.</li>

<li>Sharing: I&rsquo;m 34 years old. After my assets reached 10 million TWD last year, I went all-in on 00662. I&rsquo;ve been through two downturns but my conviction is stronger, and I haven&rsquo;t sold a single share. He pointed out that many people in Taiwan are superstitious about 0050, but in reality, nearly 60% of 0050 is TSMC, making it highly concentrated in risk, far more so than QQQ. The entire market cap of the Taiwan stock market is less than that of Apple alone.</li>
<li>Question: I&rsquo;m concerned about the risk of war across the Taiwan Strait. I&rsquo;ve researched and found that historically, even in cases of defeat or occupation, the occupying force usually recognizes the stock assets of the citizens. Is this understanding correct?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your understanding is correct, but more importantly, the 00662 (QQQ) we invest in is a U.S. asset, holding the top 100 companies in the United States. Even if local assets in Taiwan are damaged, our U.S. dollar assets are safe. Therefore, it&rsquo;s more important to be prepared for personal safety (e.g., ensuring your passport is valid). From another perspective, when Taiwanese people invest in U.S. assets, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo; act because it helps to activate Taiwan&rsquo;s vast foreign exchange reserves, creating greater value for the entire society.</li>

<li>Sharing: He shared the huge shift in his perspective after investing. He no longer requires his children to pursue high-paying jobs but encourages them to do what they love, because he can provide a solid backing for them through his investments.

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Very well said. It&rsquo;s normal that &ldquo;having money makes us find spending money boring.&rdquo; When money is no longer a constraint, life is not boring; you can do anything meaningful. This is true for people like Buffett and Musk. The ultimate purpose of wealth is to gain freedom of the mind, to define your own value rather than being defined by society&rsquo;s values.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You study for your own life, not for a job or for investing. Of course, in a utilitarian society, finding a decent job helps gain social respect. Just seek a balance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: How should one invest in a 401K account?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You should max it out, including the Roth 401K. For investment choices, you should select Large-Cap Growth funds, not Mid-Cap Growth, because the former performs better in the long run.</li>

<p>This session was a deep dive into the evolution of investment philosophy. Through the vivid &ldquo;animal evolution&rdquo; metaphor, Teacher James clearly analyzed the fundamental difference between successful and unsuccessful investors. It&rsquo;s not about how sophisticated their techniques are, but whether they can build a powerful system that can withstand extreme risks and endure through time cycles. The core strategy remains the beautifully simple &ldquo;buy and hold&rdquo; of a quality index fund (QQQ). At the same time, the course provided very practical guidance on asset activation and warned of the associated risks. Ultimately, investing is not just about accumulating wealth, but about gaining freedom of the mind to face life with composure and realize one&rsquo;s true value.</p>

      <description>This session&amp;#39;s core sharing focuses on shifting from a labor mindset to a rich mindset, learning how to leverage financial operations to consume with hundreds of times more assets than one&amp;#39;s own small capital, achieving continuous asset growth without selling. Teacher James elaborates on the importance of focusing on investing in the Nasdaq 100 index and refutes the drawbacks of other investment methods and financial products. The Q&amp;amp;A session delves into practical operational issues such as asset allocation, stock-backed loans, insurance, and cross-border asset management.</description>

<p>The core theme of this session is to <strong>break free from a labor mindset and establish a rich mindset</strong>. Traditional wisdom suggests that one needs to work hard, save money, and invest to get rich, while the core of a rich mindset is understanding how to utilize financial leverage. Teacher James illustrates with specific examples how a small principal (e.g., $30,000) can be used to spend far more than the principal (e.g., $1,000,000) through long-term low-interest borrowing (such as stock-backed loans), while the principal itself compounds in the market over the long term, with its future value sufficient to cover all debts. This financial operation of &ldquo;borrowing to spend, never selling assets&rdquo; is where the real big money is, far superior to the &ldquo;peanuts&rdquo; earned from stock picking and short-term trading.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on one, eliminate distractions</strong>: The only investment target is the Nasdaq 100 index fund (e.g., QQQ). Ignore market fluctuations, financial news, analyst opinions, financial reports, and any other recommended ETFs (such as VT, SPY, VTI, and various 0098x and other &ldquo;demonic&rdquo; codes in Taiwan). The teacher guarantees with 40+ years of investment experience that if there were a better target, he would have recommended it long ago.</li>
<li><strong>Trust in predecessors&rsquo; experience, avoid self-trial and error</strong>: Beginners should first accept the warning &ldquo;don&rsquo;t touch fire,&rdquo; meaning don&rsquo;t touch investment targets not recommended by the teacher. Asking questions won&rsquo;t teach you anything; you should calmly watch hundreds of videos first, and then the questions you have will be genuine. Learning from the wisdom and experience of predecessors (e.g., reading classics like &ldquo;Tao Te Ching,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Bible&rdquo;) can help avoid detours, which is the cheapest way to learn in life.</li>
<li><strong>Be highly vigilant of the financial system</strong>: You&rsquo;re alert when you receive a scam call, but you completely trust what financial advisors and insurance agents tell you, and that&rsquo;s the scariest scam. View the <strong>financial industry, insurance industry, and government</strong> as a united potential &ldquo;scam group,&rdquo; and be vigilant about any products they recommend.</li>
<li><strong>Advice for newcomers</strong>: New friends can start by watching video <strong>00451</strong> on our YouTube channel to build a basic understanding.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Consolidation</strong>: All funds and individual stocks should be converted into an asset allocation based on QQQ.</li>
<li><strong>Account Configuration Recommendations for US Investors</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Leveraged Funds (QLD, TQQQ)</strong>: Should be 99.99% placed in tax-advantaged retirement accounts (e.g., Roth IRA).</li>
<li><strong>Cash</strong>: Can be placed in any account, but for different purposes.
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash in Roth accounts</strong>: Used for &ldquo;smart rebalancing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Cash in Stock-Backed Loan Accounts (Pledge Account)</strong>: Used to reduce account volatility and prevent margin calls.</li>
<li><strong>Cash in Taxable Accounts or Traditional IRA</strong>: Used to slow down the appreciation rate of that account, which helps with tax planning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Warning for Non-US Residents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not open accounts with US brokers</strong>: Non-US tax residents will face up to 40% estate tax on assets in the US, and accounts may be frozen at any time. The process for descendants to handle inheritance is extremely cumbersome and complex, and lawyer fees may deplete most of the assets.</li>
<li><strong>Keep money close</strong>: Assets should remain in your country of residence. If you live in Taiwan, keep your money in Taiwan; if you live in Hong Kong, keep your money in Hong Kong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Financial Education</strong>: Educating children about finance is more important than academic performance. Children can have poor grades, they can be lazy, but they cannot be ignorant of financial management. In a capitalist society, knowing how to grow assets is more crucial than having a high degree but being a &ldquo;pauper.&rdquo; Cultivate independent thinking and judgment.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Misconceptions of traditional labor mindset</strong>: Believing that one must work hard, save diligently, and invest diligently to have money to spend. This is a passive and inefficient mindset that prevents an easy life.</li>
<li><strong>Core of Rich Mindset – Financial Operations</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>The Art of Borrowing</strong>: The core of borrowing is not to consider the interest rate first, but that the <strong>loan term should be as long as possible</strong>. If a loan can be repaid principal and interest in 40 years, even if the interest rate is as high as 8%, it&rsquo;s worth borrowing because inflation and asset appreciation will far exceed the interest cost.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging Small Capital for Large Assets</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: You currently have $30,000. At an annualized return of 15%, it will grow to nearly $7,000,000 in 40 years. Based on this enormous future asset, you now have the ability to borrow $1,000,000 to spend, as long as this loan is long-term, or even never requires principal repayment (like a stock-backed loan). Your asset growth rate will exceed your debt growth rate.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Don&rsquo;t spend your $30,000; let it snowball. The money you spend is borrowed. This is the essence of financial operations, which involves tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stop Focusing on Small Money</strong>: Don&rsquo;t dwell on stock picking, short-term trading, and other behaviors aimed at earning price differences. These are insignificant like sesame seeds compared to the grand scope of financial operations.</li>

<li>Question 1: Regarding workplace salary, I asked my boss for a $20,000 raise and a $50,000 bonus. My boss agreed to the raise but refused the bonus, which I accepted. I felt that the long-term nature of salary was more important than a one-time bonus. I&rsquo;d like to ask for Teacher James&rsquo;s opinion.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your decision was absolutely correct. Supervisors are usually willing to give raises because the money belongs to the company, not them personally. A fixed salary increase is permanent, while a bonus is one-time and can be canceled by the company at any time. This aligns with our philosophy of long-term investing, which seeks stable and continuous growth (15% annually) rather than short-term spikes (a single day&rsquo;s surge). You&rsquo;ve grasped the key point.</li>

<li>Share 1: I only discovered the teacher&rsquo;s channel in late August and felt like I&rsquo;d struck gold. Within a week, I invested all my funds into the market and plan to invest the money from cashing out my endowment insurance.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Excellent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Share 2: I shared the teacher&rsquo;s philosophy with a beauty industry group I founded, hoping my peers could also benefit, as many in our industry receive advance payments from clients, which serves as excellent interest-free cash flow for investment. However, some people left the group as soon as they heard about investing, which made me feel frustrated and regretful.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: This is a very typical reaction. Topics like investing and politics should not be shared casually in non-homogeneous groups. Every group has its inherent attributes, and abruptly introducing unrelated topics, like discussing politics in a group, will inevitably cause a &ldquo;commotion.&rdquo; You must anticipate such a reaction. Also, a reminder: for advance payments received by businesses, you need to reserve sufficient working capital for operations and not over-invest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 1: A client of mine, almost 50 years old, thinks this investment method is too slow and that one doesn&rsquo;t have many 40-year periods in life. I&rsquo;d like to hear the teacher&rsquo;s insights. Also, should the funds from my surrendered endowment insurance all be invested in 00865B (Taiwanese short-term government bond ETF) as cash, or do I need to keep some in a savings account at the bank?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Regarding your client&rsquo;s question, this is a difference in mindset. For fund allocation, cash does not need to be kept in the bank. 00865B has excellent liquidity; if you sell today, the money arrives the day after tomorrow, so it can be used entirely as cash. For daily expenses, try to use credit cards, and then sell 00865B once to repay the bill. Your subsequent income can be vaguely and randomly invested into 00662, 00670L, and 00865B, no need to be overly precise, for example, rotating among the three every four months.</li>

<li>Question 1: I&rsquo;m 53. Due to government housing policies, I&rsquo;m considering selling my self-occupied home in Taoyuan at a low price and renting instead, which would give me about 5 million in cash. Should I use this money to pay off my car loan and personal loan first, and then invest the remaining money using a 70/30 or 60/13/30 strategy? Also, I pay a lot for insurance every month, and some policies are nearing their maturity. What should I do?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You can sell the house and invest the money. But <strong>absolutely do not use the money from selling the house to pay off any loans</strong>. Borrowed money is &ldquo;someone else&rsquo;s chicken&rdquo;; let it lay eggs. Your own money is &ldquo;your own chicken&rdquo;; let it lay eggs too. Use your future salary from re-entering the workforce to make monthly installment payments. For insurance, <strong>immediately, right now, surrender all of it</strong>; take back whatever you can. As long as you stop paying, you win, and you&rsquo;ll have tens of millions more in the future.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Regarding the order of placing leveraged funds in accounts, why would Traditional IRA/401k be prioritized over a Brokerage Account? This seems to contradict the idea of &ldquo;putting cash in a Traditional account to slow appreciation.&rdquo; Moreover, future withdrawals from Traditional accounts are taxed at Income Tax rates, which are higher than Brokerage&rsquo;s Capital Gain Tax rates.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This question is more complex. The core reasons are: 1) Leveraged funds cannot be used for stock-backed loans. Placing leveraged funds in a Brokerage account would &ldquo;pollute&rdquo; this account, which might be used for pledging in the future. 2) Leveraged funds have high volatility and will inevitably require rebalancing, which would incur taxes if done in a Brokerage account. Although the future tax rate in a Traditional account is higher, it provides a &ldquo;tax deferral&rdquo; effect, allowing you to operate freely internally without tax worries. More importantly, you don&rsquo;t need to allocate leverage in every account. <strong>The core is to maintain the overall investment portfolio&rsquo;s Beta value at 1.0.</strong> You can achieve Beta 1.0 through leveraged funds in Roth accounts and cash or QQQ in Traditional/Brokerage accounts. This results in the same return but with a superior tax structure and risk control.</li>

<li>Share 1: After listening to the teacher&rsquo;s class, I decided to cancel a life insurance policy I had paid for 7 years, at CAD 20,000 per year. Although I lost CAD 100,000, I felt relieved. My husband also agreed because I calculated for him that even if we only got back a portion of this money, its value in 40 years would far exceed the CAD 1,000,000 insured amount. I don&rsquo;t regret my past decisions because they were made with the knowledge I had at the time, but now my understanding has upgraded.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Excellent sharing and decision. Having tens of millions in assets while alive is far more meaningful than receiving a million in insurance after death.</li>

</li>
<li>Question 1: I&rsquo;m 50 and plan to sell an investment property, expecting CAD 900,000 in cash. How should I allocate this large sum into my planned configuration of 40% QQQ, 15% QLD, 10% TQQQ, and 35% cash?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: For someone nearing retirement, safety is paramount. First, calculate how many years of living expenses you&rsquo;ll need after retirement and prepare <strong>at least 10-15 years of cash</strong>. For example, if you spend 60,000 a year, you&rsquo;ll need 600,000 in cash for 10 years. Set this money aside first, and then allocate the remaining funds according to your asset allocation ratio.</li>

<li>Share 1: I spent two weeks manually typing the 120,000 words of Mr. Huang Pei-Yuan&rsquo;s book &ldquo;The Bible of Financial Management,&rdquo; published in 1996, into an electronic version because its content is highly consistent with the CLEC philosophy. I want to share it with everyone, but I have concerns about copyright.

<li>Share 1: My short-term trading for the past 10 years ultimately amounted to nothing, but in the past two years, I switched to long-term QQQ investing, yielding substantial returns.</li>
<li>Question 1: I leveraged an additional NT$15 million from real estate in Taiwan, with an interest rate of 2.88%, renewed annually, with no principal repayment required. Is it feasible to invest this money and then use a portion of the investment profits to pay the interest, continuing this operation? Also, I am currently in the US, with most of my assets in Taiwan. Is this long-term plan suitable?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Short-term operations are feasible. But in the long run, if you and your children will eventually settle in the US, assets should ultimately be transferred to the US. This is primarily to simplify estate planning and avoid Taiwan&rsquo;s relatively high estate tax on large cash assets. The US estate tax exemption is much higher than Taiwan&rsquo;s. You need to be aware of the potential risks and penalties of not declaring overseas assets to the IRS and plan accordingly.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>Immediately, right now, buy all at once</strong>. Investing in batches leads to poorer performance and is a tormenting process. You can adopt a 70/30 strategy, meaning 70% of the funds are bought immediately, and the remaining 30% is held as cash (invested in a money market fund). Don&rsquo;t be afraid of buying at a high point; looking back a few years from now, any current price will seem low.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>Absolutely not</strong>. This is an unnecessary complication that will only bring endless trouble, such as accounting, tax filing, company maintenance, etc. For long-term investors who don&rsquo;t sell, a personal Brokerage account is already very tax-optimized, so there&rsquo;s no need to complicate things for a little extra Roth space.

<li>Question 1: In the teacher&rsquo;s simulation, the final asset multiple of the 433 configuration without pledging (5.8x) was higher than that with pledging (4.somethingx). So why should we still choose stock-backed loans?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The simulation results depend on the historical market path. Our simulated period (starting from the 2000 high) was a &ldquo;volatile market&rdquo; with a sharp ten-year decline followed by a slow recovery. In such a market, &ldquo;mindless rebalancing&rdquo; (without pledging) performs better because it dares to buy heavily during downturns. However, in a long-term bull market (e.g., 1980-2000), &ldquo;smart rebalancing&rdquo; (with pledging) would outperform. The most important reason we choose pledging is not to pursue the highest return, but to <strong>ensure survival in extreme markets and avoid liquidation.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: When actually taking out a stock-backed loan, where does the monthly interest come from? Is it reserved from the $200,000 borrowed?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: No. The interest should also be borrowed. Your total loan limit is very high (e.g., $6 million on $10 million in assets), and you only borrowed $200,000. The monthly interest, a few hundred dollars, can be directly borrowed from your available credit limit. This way, your debt will increase slowly, but your assets will grow at a faster rate.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>You currently have 300 dollars, you should be able to spend 10,000 dollars.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight concisely explains the power of financial leverage. Your purchasing power should not be determined by your current cash, but by the potential future value of your assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hard work has no future&hellip; Making money work hard is what truly matters.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight overturns traditional values, emphasizing the importance of passive income and asset appreciation. The core is to make capital work for you, not the other way around.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re even vigilant when you receive a scam call, but you completely trust what your financial advisor tells you, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s truly terrifying.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight uses a strong contrast to warn investors that they must maintain independent judgment and critical thinking towards all financial institutions&rsquo; advice, not blindly trusting them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The financial industry, the insurance industry, and the government, combined, are a scam group.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight, in an extreme way, reminds investors to be highly wary of complex products recommended by all financial institutions, as their goal is usually to earn your fees and commissions, not to serve your best interests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Beta is the same, the volatility is the same, the return rate is the same.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This insight is the scientific core of asset allocation. The return of an investment portfolio is determined by its overall market risk exposure (Beta), not by how many &ldquo;magical&rdquo; leveraged products it contains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I actually didn&rsquo;t feel much pain, discomfort, or regret&hellip; because that was the decision I made based on my understanding at the time, but now I&rsquo;m different.
&ndash; Jenny</p></blockquote>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s reflection when sharing her decision to surrender a loss-making insurance policy embodies the process of an investor&rsquo;s mental maturation: not being trapped by past sunk costs, but bravely making the right decision based on a higher level of understanding now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not a truth you&rsquo;ve realized yourself, there&rsquo;s no extra profit in it for you, because it belongs to others.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasizes the importance of independent thinking and truly understanding investment philosophy. Following the crowd or using strategies one doesn&rsquo;t understand, even if profitable in the short term, cannot be sustained in the long run because it doesn&rsquo;t fall within one&rsquo;s own circle of competence.</p>

<p>This gathering was a profound course in reshaping financial intelligence. Teacher James fundamentally challenged the traditional notion of &ldquo;work hard, save money to get rich,&rdquo; clearly advocating a rich mindset centered on &ldquo;financial operations.&rdquo; Through the strategy of &ldquo;borrowing to consume, never selling assets,&rdquo; investors can break free from dependence on active income, allowing assets to calmly compound in the market over the long term. The Q&amp;A session served as a rich case study, applying this core concept to diverse real-world scenarios such as salary negotiations, insurance decisions, large-sum asset deployment, and cross-border asset management, providing listeners with extremely valuable practical guidance and mindset building. The entire sharing was not just about &ldquo;technique&rdquo; (how to invest), but more about &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; (how to think about wealth).</p>

<li><strong>Core Philosophy</strong>: The market has no ceiling; it will only go higher. The simplest and most effective investment method is to &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, and never sell.&rdquo; The only thing investors need to do is buy; they don&rsquo;t even need to consider selling. This simple truth is often not understood by the public, while the media prefers sensational and &ldquo;bloodthirsty&rdquo; headlines to attract attention.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Cannot Be Taught, Only Learned</strong>: The teacher stresses that even if the audience listens to what he says, they may not truly learn it. True mastery comes from investors spending their own time watching videos, thinking independently, and studying.</li>
<li><strong>Introduction to a Powerful Learning Resource Library</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Chen Feng&rsquo;s Platform</strong>: Page 20 of the lecture notes provides a link to the platform organized by Chen Feng, which integrates all of CLEC&rsquo;s important resources.</li>
<li><strong>Annual Playlists</strong>: The platform allows direct access to the complete course playlists for 2023 and 2024, making it convenient for new students to learn systematically.</li>
<li><strong>AI Interactive Tool (NotebookLM)</strong>: Chen Feng has &ldquo;fed&rdquo; the content of CLEC&rsquo;s long and short videos into an AI model to create a knowledge base. Students can log in with their Google account and ask the AI questions in a conversational manner. The AI will provide relevant answers based on the questions and indicate which videos the knowledge comes from, greatly improving the efficiency of learning and finding information.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Statement Learning Resources</strong>: The teacher specifically shared the <strong>2018</strong> and <strong>2022</strong> course playlists on the YouTube channel, which contain complete instructional content on financial statement analysis, suitable for students who want to study in-depth.</li>
<li><strong>The Teacher&rsquo;s ChatGPT</strong>: Page 23 of the lecture notes provides a link to the ChatGPT trained by James himself, which is also a powerful learning tool.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>For the Young or Those with Insufficient Funds</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: When your total capital is not enough to cover <strong>three years</strong> of annual expenses, complex asset allocation is not recommended.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: First, save up <strong>one year</strong> of emergency funds (in cash or a money market fund). Any amount exceeding the emergency fund should be fully invested in QQQ or 00662.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If your annual expense is 100,000 and your total assets are 160,000, then 100,000 should be kept as an emergency fund, and only 60,000 can be invested.</li>
<li><strong>Turning Point</strong>: When the cash portion can reach about 30% of your total assets, and this amount already exceeds one year&rsquo;s expenses, you can start considering a more systematic asset allocation. For example, with total assets of 500,000 and annual expenses of 100,000, 30% cash is 150,000, which is higher than the 100,000 emergency fund requirement. At this point, you can start asset allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation and Pledging Strategy for High-Net-Worth Individuals (433 Model)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Case Study</strong>: A 35-year-old friend with 60 million in assets uses a 433 asset allocation (40% QQQ, 30% QLD, 30% short-term bonds/cash).</li>
<li><strong>2% Living Expense Rule</strong>: Borrow 2% of <strong>total assets</strong> annually for living expenses through stock pledging. In this case, it&rsquo;s 2% of 60 million, which is 1.2 million per year. <strong>The key is that it&rsquo;s based on total assets, not 2% of a single holding (like QQQ)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Long-Term Growth</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In the 10th year: Total assets are expected to grow from 60 million to about 200 million, while total debt (including interest) will be around 14 million, resulting in a very healthy debt ratio of only 7%.</li>
<li>At that point, the living expense standard can be raised, for example, to live on 1% (2 million/year) or 2% (4 million/year) of 200 million.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rebalancing and Taxes</strong>: After significant asset growth, you can re-allocate your assets. For U.S. investors, rebalancing within a ROTH account can effectively avoid capital gains tax, which is highly efficient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Health First: Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Importance</strong>: The teacher strongly recommends that everyone, especially friends over 40, pay for an LDCT lung cancer screening.</li>
<li><strong>Judgment Criteria</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If a nodule smaller than 0.6cm is found, there is no need to worry excessively; annual follow-ups are sufficient.</li>
<li>If a nodule larger than 0.8cm is found, you must immediately consult a thoracic specialist. The doctor will arrange for follow-up tracking (usually covered by health insurance). If the nodule shows signs of growth during the observation period, it needs to be dealt with promptly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Core Idea</strong>: Early detection and early treatment are key. Do not neglect screening out of fear of &ldquo;false positives.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Question 1: My son lives in Taiwan, but his US dollar income is directly deposited into a Hong Kong account. Should he bring the money back to Taiwan to buy 00662, or open an account in Hong Kong to buy QQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The core principle is &ldquo;<strong>If you are in Taiwan, your money should be in Taiwan</strong>.&rdquo; Funds should not be kept in Hong Kong. Remit the money back to Taiwan and declare it as income for tax purposes normally. Don&rsquo;t worry about exchange rate fluctuations; in the long run, the average exchange rate from remitting in batches will tend towards an expected value. The exchange rate is irrelevant to long-term investment. If you have money, you should buy immediately and not let the exchange rate influence your decision.</li>

<li>Question 2: Regarding the 60 million asset case, living off a 2% pledge (1.2 million) annually, if I only need 1% (600,000), should I only withdraw 1%, or withdraw 2% and invest the extra 1% back?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Just withdraw the 1% you need. You can choose not to use the extra credit line, or you can borrow it to reinvest, which will make you grow faster. Both are acceptable.</li>

<li>Question 1: She is 63 this year and has already converted part of her Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Her company&rsquo;s 401k also allows Roth contributions. Should she, from now on, choose Roth for everything she can convert and contribute to?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes, that is very correct and urgent. First, all future contributions should go into a Roth 401k. Second, she has 1.7M in a Traditional IRA and must speed up the conversion. Otherwise, she will face a huge tax burden at age 75 due to RMD (Required Minimum Distribution). Based on calculations, she needs to convert about 270,000 per year to finish before age 75. It&rsquo;s easier to convert now while she has work income than after retirement when she has no cash flow. Consider borrowing from a pledged account to pay the conversion tax.</li>

<li>Question 1: Is it necessary for high-net-worth individuals to do stock pledging?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Not necessarily, but this is precisely the difference between being &ldquo;<strong>rich</strong>&rdquo; and being &ldquo;<strong>super-rich</strong>.&rdquo; He used a striking example: with 60 million in assets, if you use pledged loans for living expenses (allowing the principal to compound at 15%), your net worth could reach <strong>15.8 billion</strong> after 40 years. However, if you don&rsquo;t pledge and instead sell assets for living expenses each year (causing the total return rate to drop to 13%), your assets will only be <strong>800 million</strong> after 40 years, a difference of nearly 20 times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: What should be the order of borrowing? Mortgage, personal loan, stock pledge—which takes priority?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You can use lower-interest mortgages or personal loans to borrow funds and invest them in the market (buy QQQ/00662), and then use the money borrowed from stock pledging to pay the monthly installments of the mortgage or personal loan. This frees up your salary, allowing 100% of it to be reinvested, creating a powerful positive cycle. This is the most efficient way to grow wealth.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This information is all &ldquo;<strong>demons and ghosts</strong>&rdquo;; you must dispel them with facts. The so-called &ldquo;unprofitable AI companies&rdquo; refer to small startups, which is normal. But the large tech companies in the QQQ components that we invest in (like Meta, Google, Microsoft) are not only profitable but are also growing rapidly, especially in the B2B sector, where AI is generating very substantial revenue.

</li>
<li>Question 2: How should we view the Buffett Indicator (Total US Stock Market Cap / GDP Ratio) being at a historical high, suggesting the market is overvalued?

<li>Sharing 1: He feels that the more he learns, the harder it is to communicate with friends who don&rsquo;t understand investing.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: That shouldn&rsquo;t be the case. In theory, <strong>the more you know, the easier it should be to communicate with others in simpler, more accessible terms</strong>, just like a university professor can explain complex mathematical concepts to a middle school student. The key to communication is to listen and adjust your frequency to match the other person&rsquo;s, rather than adopting a &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; mentality. If the other person cannot accept it, you can say, &ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; and end the conversation.</li>
</ul>

<li>Sharing 2: When he talks about investing with friends, their first reaction is always &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have money,&rdquo; and they hope to find a &ldquo;guaranteed profit, no-risk&rdquo; method.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is the &ldquo;fatalistic&rdquo; thinking instilled in many people by their families of origin and culture, such as &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no such thing as a free lunch&rdquo; and &ldquo;only hard work leads to wealth.&rdquo; The truth is, <strong>it is very difficult to become rich through work alone. Only those who understand financial operations and investing can achieve financial freedom</strong>. The financial system in the United States (like the 401k) encourages the entire population to invest, whereas many emerging countries are still stuck in the stage of encouraging hard work alone.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1 (The Importance of Roth): She is in the US, and one of the biggest changes after getting to know the teacher was converting all her 401k to Roth. She reminds everyone that a Traditional 401k is only tax-deferred, not tax-free. For those who know how to invest, retirement accounts will grow to a very large amount, and withdrawals from a traditional account will face terrifying tax rates. Young people must choose Roth.</li>
<li>Sharing 2 (New US Tax Law Rule): As a payroll system expert, she shared a new rule effective in 2025: for people over 50 with an annual income exceeding $145,000, their additional &ldquo;Catch-up&rdquo; contributions can only be put into a Roth 401k, no longer into a pre-tax Traditional 401k.</li>
<li>Sharing 3 (Pledging vs. Selling): She strongly agrees with the teacher&rsquo;s &ldquo;chicken and golden egg&rdquo; analogy. Selling stocks is like killing the chicken that lays golden eggs. Not only is the chicken gone, but you also have to pay taxes on the income from selling the chicken, which is a double loss. Pledging allows the chicken to continue laying eggs; you are just borrowing some future eggs. It is a superior strategy.</li>
<li>Question: She is planning her post-retirement operational sequence: first, sell company stock and convert to QQQ; then, convert SPY to QQQ; and finally, convert Traditional 401k to Roth annually as needed. She asks if this sequence is reasonable.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The sequence is reasonable. The key is to calculate and control the annual operations to fall within the ideal tax bracket. He also suggests that she can allocate some cash within her Traditional 401k to slow its growth rate, thereby reducing the future tax burden upon conversion. However, she should also be careful not to sacrifice too much of the overall portfolio&rsquo;s return (Beta) in the process.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: If my company&rsquo;s 401k investment options are very poor, should I give it up and only invest in a brokerage account?

<blockquote>
<p>The market has no ceiling, it will only go higher, so you don&rsquo;t have to do anything, you don&rsquo;t have to worry, it will hit new highs and bring you immense wealth.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: At the beginning of the session, the teacher emphasized the mindset investors should have—a firm belief in the long-term upward trend of the market, which is the cornerstone of adopting a &ldquo;buy and hold&rdquo; strategy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investing can&rsquo;t be taught, it can only be learned by oneself. You won&rsquo;t get it just by listening to me. If you don&rsquo;t learn it yourself, you won&rsquo;t get it.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: After introducing numerous learning tools, the teacher stressed the importance of proactive learning and self-exploration in the field of investment. Attending lectures is just the starting point; true understanding requires personal practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are in Taiwan, your money should be in Taiwan.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When answering Bruce&rsquo;s question about his son&rsquo;s US dollar income in Hong Kong, the teacher gave this clear and concise principle, emphasizing that funds should be consistent with one&rsquo;s place of residence for ease of management and tax compliance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This (pledging or not) is the difference between being rich and being super-rich.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When explaining why one should use stock pledging, the teacher used an example showing a nearly twenty-fold difference in assets after 40 years, vividly illustrating the huge impact of using (or not using) leverage tools on the ultimate scale of wealth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your salary is the so-called GDP, and your salary increase is GDP growth. Your assets are the result of past accumulation, so our market value is the result of past accumulation.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When refuting the bearish market argument that the &ldquo;Market Cap to GDP ratio is too high,&rdquo; the teacher used the analogy of personal salary versus total assets to clearly reveal the logical fallacy of this indicator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more you know, the easier it should be to communicate with people.
&ndash; Teacher James
Background: In response to a student&rsquo;s confusion about finding it harder to communicate as they learn more, the teacher pointed out that true wisdom is demonstrated by the ability to simplify complexity and communicate effectively with people at different levels of understanding.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you just sell stocks&hellip; you are essentially killing one of your chickens. Not only will this chicken no longer lay eggs for you, but the chicken itself is also gone.
&ndash; Penny</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: In her sharing, Penny used the vivid &ldquo;killing the goose that lays the golden eggs&rdquo; analogy to profoundly explain the essential difference and the pros and cons between selling stocks for living expenses and using stock pledging to borrow funds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely impossible to become wealthy through work. People who work longer might even become poorer. Only those who understand will become rich, and those who know how to borrow money will become super-rich.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Commenting on the prevalent societal belief of &ldquo;getting rich through hard work,&rdquo; the teacher revealed the truth about wealth growth, emphasizing the importance of financial literacy and the skillful use of leverage.</p>

<p>This session began by reaffirming the investment anchor of &ldquo;buy and hold, never sell,&rdquo; instilling strong confidence in investors amidst a volatile market. Teacher James and senior student Chen Feng detailed the newly integrated AI learning platform, tools that will significantly enhance students&rsquo; efficiency in self-directed learning. The core discussion, through an analysis of asset allocation strategies for young people and high-net-worth individuals, clearly outlined a path to wealth from accumulation to the skillful use of capital. The in-depth interpretation of stock pledging, in particular, revealed its immense potential as a wealth amplifier. The Q&amp;A session was exceptionally insightful, not only solving students&rsquo; specific problems in areas like taxation, retirement planning, and asset allocation but also providing profound inspiration regarding investment mindset, communication wisdom, and information discernment. This was a comprehensive sharing that covered everything from the Tao (investment philosophy) to the techniques (specific strategies) and the tools (learning instruments).</p>

      <description>In this session, James delves into the core philosophy of long-term investing, emphasizing that investors should adopt a &amp;#39;do nothing&amp;#39; mindset, ignoring short-term market fluctuations, macroeconomic data, and various news noise. He points out that the key to success lies in proper risk management—namely, using rational asset allocation and sufficient cash reserves to cope with market uncertainty, rather than trying to predict the market. The course also analyzes the difficulties of value investing, the currency dilemmas of emerging markets, and answers student questions on practical topics such as geographic arbitrage, family financial communication, and the rate of return on insurance products.</description>

<p>This session revolves around the core concept of long-term investing—a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; approach. James emphasizes that investors should ignore short-term market fluctuations, macroeconomic data, financial reports, and even political news, and instead, stick to buying and holding high-quality assets (like QQQ) for the long term. The key to success is not in predicting market highs and lows, but in proper risk management, which means using sensible asset allocation and maintaining sufficient cash reserves to handle any market condition. The market has no peak; it will only go higher. Investors should focus on the future 20 years from now, rather than worrying about tomorrow&rsquo;s ups and downs.</p>

<li><strong>&ldquo;Do Nothing&rdquo; Approach</strong>: The best investment strategy is to buy and then leave it alone; the market will naturally reach new highs. Trying to manage or predict the market is more likely to lead to failure.</li>
<li><strong>Ignore Market Noise</strong>: Investors don&rsquo;t need to care about what Trump or Putin says, nor should they pay attention to economic data like PPI and CPI or company earnings reports. This short-term information is irrelevant to long-term investing.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Time</strong>: Investing requires a long-term view, at least a 20-year horizon. Thinking about the person you want to become in 20 years is more meaningful than worrying about tomorrow&rsquo;s market. Getting rich overnight is impossible, but going bankrupt overnight is common, which is why risk control is crucial.</li>

<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: The only way to face market volatility is through proper asset allocation and having enough cash, not by trying to predict the market.</li>
<li><strong>Investing with Loans</strong>: Whether it&rsquo;s a personal loan or a mortgage, you must ensure you can repay it with your salary. For retirees with no income, taking out a wealth management mortgage is not recommended; a reverse mortgage could be considered to increase cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging</strong>: When pledging stocks, you must also understand asset allocation and keep enough cash on hand to deal with market fluctuations, avoiding a margin call due to a market downturn.</li>

<li><strong>Limitations of Currencies</strong>: The domestic currencies of emerging countries (like the New Taiwan Dollar) are not internationally circulated and cannot be directly converted into US dollars.</li>
<li><strong>Sources of Foreign Exchange Reserves</strong>: A country&rsquo;s foreign exchange reserves mainly come from two channels:
<ol>
<li><strong>Current Account</strong>: Earning foreign currency by exporting goods and services, such as TSMC&rsquo;s export revenues. These are called &ldquo;slave dollars&rdquo; because a great deal of labor is required to earn them.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Account</strong>: Inflow of foreign capital for investment (e.g., buying stocks). This capital can come and go quickly, easily causing financial turmoil and leading to national bankruptcy.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Bankruptcy</strong>: When a country&rsquo;s export capability is weak and it relies heavily on foreign capital from the financial account, it faces a financial crisis or even national bankruptcy if that foreign capital withdraws on a large scale and its foreign reserves are insufficient to cope.</li>

<li><strong>Opportunity Cost is a Real Loss</strong>: Short-term paper losses are temporary and non-existent. However, the gains you miss out on due to hesitation (the money you could have earned) are a permanent and tangible loss.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If QQQ rises from 400 to 577, and you didn&rsquo;t buy at 400, you have permanently lost that 177 in profit. This loss can never be recovered.</li>

</li>
<li><strong>Act Immediately</strong>: Therefore, you should buy immediately when you have the money; this is the action with the highest expected value. The later you buy, the less you earn, the lower your wealth growth base becomes, and the wider the gap between you and others will grow.</li>

<li>Sharing: He recently read discussions about how AI will change the world, which made him feel that he shouldn&rsquo;t retire in the next 10 years. He feels he should work hard as this might be his last job opportunity, and he doesn&rsquo;t want to sell his growing QQQ for living expenses.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: The decision to work should not be based on fear of the future (like AI replacing jobs). You should ask yourself: Do you like your job? Are you working for money or for happiness? This is the fundamental reason that should determine whether you continue to work, regardless of the AI era or a future space age.</li>

<li>Question: He recently saw online discussions about &ldquo;geographic arbitrage,&rdquo; which involves moving to Southeast Asian countries with lower living costs (like Thailand or Vietnam) to make savings last longer. He wants to ask if this approach is feasible and what the risks or recommendations are.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;arbitrage&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s &ldquo;having no way out.&rdquo; Moving to a place you don&rsquo;t genuinely like just to save money is a form of external diseconomy and is not advisable. We should strive to live in an environment we like and find convenient, not be forced into a choice because of a lack of money. If you move to Hualien or Taitung because they are beautiful, that&rsquo;s the right choice even if it costs more than Taipei. But if it&rsquo;s just to save money, it&rsquo;s the wrong choice.</li>

The situation you described is much like a doctor&rsquo;s dilemma: seeing a patient who can&rsquo;t afford a necessary stent, the doctor is helpless. Poverty is a disease, and we can&rsquo;t save everyone; even the thousand-armed Guanyin has limits. What you can do is tell them the correct concept once, fulfilling your responsibility.

<li>Question: While listening to Howard Marks&rsquo;s audiobook, he understood that market cycles don&rsquo;t have a fixed length but are driven by the collective sentiment of the masses. When the market is extremely euphoric, it&rsquo;s a bubble, and vice versa. Is this understanding correct?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Your understanding is completely correct. The only indicator of a bubble, as Howard Marks says, is that &ldquo;investors have gone crazy&rdquo;; there are no other quantitative metrics. But the difficulty with this theory is in its execution. Everyone is in a different environment and has a different perception of the market&rsquo;s &ldquo;temperature,&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s very hard to pinpoint the peak.

<li>Sharing: She introduced James&rsquo;s investment philosophy to a very conservative elder, who ultimately only agreed to invest NT$20,000 per month into 006208 (a Taiwanese ETF) on a regular basis. She feels a bit anxious about this, thinking it&rsquo;s too slow.</li>
<li>Question: This elder insists they have an insurance policy bought 30-40 years ago with an 8% return. She suspects this was just a sales pitch from the agent back then and wants to ask how to explain to the elder that the actual return on this policy is likely not that high.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: First, don&rsquo;t be anxious. If the person involved isn&rsquo;t in a hurry, we shouldn&rsquo;t be either. You don&rsquo;t know if your advice will save them or harm them. What if they invest and the market drops in the short term? They will blame you. Taking it slow is a good thing. Regarding the insurance policy, an 8% return is almost impossible. You need to calculate the actual annualized rate of return (IRR or XIRR), not a simple arithmetic average. Especially considering the funds invested early on were locked up for 20-30 years with no return, the opportunity cost during that period is enormous. A rough estimate shows that if the same money (NT$750,000 invested annually for 20 years) were put into the market (at a 10% annualized return), it would become NT$100 million after 28 years. The policy, however, only pays out NT$1 million per year, making the return not even 1%. It&rsquo;s essentially a product from a &ldquo;scam group.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Sharing: A follow-up on family financial communication. He realized that for large investments (like consolidating a mortgage to free up several million), he must get his wife&rsquo;s consent. His current strategy is &ldquo;slowly might be faster,&rdquo; gradually gaining his wife&rsquo;s understanding and trust through continuous communication, sharing small gains, and explaining the long-term philosophy. He believes it&rsquo;s very important for a couple to be on the same page; otherwise, even if he makes money from investments, it could cause family conflicts.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: Your approach is absolutely correct. Take it slow, and make sure your spouse feels involved and secure. For example, you can put a portion of the money from the loan into your wife&rsquo;s account for her to manage. When she sees cash in the account, she will feel more at ease. Never make decisions on your own. Even if you succeed, your partner might get angry for not being respected, which could lead to a broken marriage.</li>

<li>Question: James mentioned that one of the three principles of asset allocation is to consider the extreme scenario of &ldquo;interest rates rising to infinity.&rdquo; He is worried that if a situation like the 1980s in the U.S. occurs, with interest rates as high as 20%, our current backtesting models based on the last 20 years of data might not hold up. Is he worrying too much?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: This is an excellent question. The way to deal with such an extreme situation is to hold more cash. If you are worried about a &ldquo;stagflation&rdquo; environment like the 1970s-1980s, where the stock market stagnated and interest rates were high, then your initial cash allocation should be higher, for example, increasing it from 30% to 40% or even 50%. Your cash reserve determines how much risk you can withstand.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>On Overseas Brokers (like Futu)</strong>: James strongly advises Taiwanese investors against using overseas brokers like Futu. The main risks are: 1. Issues with the Alternative Minimum Tax. 2. High estate taxes (potentially up to 40%). 3. If the investor has an accident, their heirs may not even find this account, and the inheritance process will be extremely difficult.</li>
<li><strong>On Exchange Rates</strong>: Investing is a decades-long endeavor; don&rsquo;t pay attention to short-term currency fluctuations. In the long run, exchange rates will fluctuate within a range and eventually converge to an expected value. Worrying about exchange rates will prevent you from doing anything.</li>
<li><strong>On the Cash Portion</strong>: The &ldquo;cash&rdquo; portion of asset allocation should absolutely not be invested in high-dividend stocks. High-dividend stocks are still stocks, they will fall, and they do not have the stability of cash. Cash should be allocated to truly safe assets like a Money Market Fund or short-term government bonds.</li>
<li><strong>On Other Funds</strong>: A student asked about actively managed funds like the Franklin Technology Fund. James&rsquo;s advice is to stop investing in such funds with high fees and potential redemption restrictions, and just buy 00662 (Taiwan&rsquo;s Nasdaq ETF) directly.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The market has no peak, it will only go higher.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: At the beginning of the session, James emphasized the long-term conviction investors should have, and not to feel fear or try to predict the top just because the market is making new highs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The money you miss out on earning is a permanent loss for your entire life&hellip; Earning less is a tangible loss.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When explaining why one should &ldquo;buy immediately with available cash,&rdquo; James pointed out that opportunity cost is a real and permanent loss, far more terrifying than short-term paper losses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You could have billions and not be able to spend it all, yet you&rsquo;re thinking of moving to a backward place&hellip; (just to save money) that&rsquo;s called having no way out.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When commenting on &ldquo;geographic arbitrage,&rdquo; James sharply pointed out that sacrificing quality of life and moving to an undesirable, cheap area due to financial constraints is not a wise move.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seeing others suffer, it&rsquo;s hard for us to save them&hellip; It&rsquo;s like Jesus, he spoke to someone&hellip; but then the person ran away because they didn&rsquo;t have enough money&hellip; and Jesus had to let go, there was nothing he could do.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: In answering Edwin&rsquo;s question on how to adjust his mindset when facing friends and family he can&rsquo;t help, James used this analogy to explain that all we can do is pass on the information. Whether the other person accepts it is beyond our control, and we must learn to let go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slowly might be faster.
&ndash; Jason</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Jason summarized this philosophical phrase when sharing his experience communicating investment concepts with his family, emphasizing the importance of patience and continuous communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a husband and wife are of one mind, they can break through metal. If they are not&hellip; even if you succeed, she might fly into a rage, &lsquo;You do everything without telling me.&rsquo;
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When commenting on family financial communication, James stressed the extreme importance of spousal consensus, otherwise even successful investments could destroy the family relationship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I said your [insurance policy] doesn&rsquo;t even pay out when it should, and he said, &lsquo;how much premium did you pay?&rsquo;&hellip; Wow, is that what you call insurance?
&ndash; James
Background: Recalling a debate with an insurance professional, James revealed the nature of some insurance products where the &ldquo;payout limit is tied to the premium paid,&rdquo; pointing out the limitations of their protective function.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take that fifteen million to buy insurance, you could have a hundred million&hellip; you only get one million a year&hellip; that&rsquo;s just taking one percent, and you&rsquo;re still smiling happily about it.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Through calculation, James revealed the extremely low rate of return on long-term savings insurance. Compared to investing in the market over the same period, the difference in returns is immense, representing a huge opportunity cost loss.</p>

</h2>
<p>This session once again reinforced the core idea of CLEC&rsquo;s long-term investing: simplify investment decisions and embrace the market&rsquo;s long-term growth. Through the concept of a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; approach, James urged investors to break free from the interference of short-term market noise and to focus on building a robust, personalized asset allocation, always maintaining sufficient cash as the ultimate defense against risk. The Q&amp;A session covered multiple dimensions, from personal mindset adjustments and family financial communication to the analysis of financial products like insurance. Using vivid examples and sharp insights, James exposed many common investment fallacies. The most central takeaway is that investing is a marathon of patience and discipline; taking immediate action and persisting for the long term is far more important than trying to find the perfect timing and valuation.</p>

      <title>00526 QQQ Can Make You One of the World&#39;s Top Billionaires; Investing in VT Will Only Make You Part of the Poor Class</title>
      <link>https://jomonylw.github.io/en/posts/1754804670291/</link>

      <description>This issue focuses on two main themes: First, there is a huge difference in the long-term returns of different index funds (such as QQQ versus SPY and VT). Choosing the wrong target can lead to slow wealth growth, akin to becoming poorer. Second, it emphasizes the critical importance of financial communication with spouses, parents, and family members on the path to wealth through investment. Consensus should be built through continuous and frank discussions to avoid family relationship breakdowns over money issues.</description>

<p>This session&rsquo;s core viewpoints from Teacher James revolve around two main areas:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Decisive Nature of Investment Choices</strong>: Not all index funds can make you rich. Through detailed data comparisons, the teacher reveals the huge long-term return gap between QQQ and other index funds like SPY and VT, emphasizing the decisive role of choosing the right investment target (like QQQ) for wealth accumulation.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Financial Communication</strong>: On the road to wealth through investment, maintaining family relationships (especially with spouses and parents) is crucial. The teacher advocates for building financial consensus and trust among family members through continuous, &ldquo;chatter-style&rdquo; communication, sharing responsibilities, and avoiding family conflicts sparked by wealth growth.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communication with a Spouse</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Constant Chatter&rdquo; Method</strong>: It&rsquo;s recommended to share investment ideas, operations, and progress with your spouse in the form of daily conversation. This isn&rsquo;t for them to fully understand, but to give them a sense of participation and the right to be informed, building synchronization and trust. For example, casually mention what you bought more of today, what class you attended, or any new ideas you have.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Responsibility</strong>: Communicating from the start to reach a consensus gives both partners a sense of ownership in the decisions. Whether there are profits or losses, you can face them together, avoiding one person bearing all the pressure and getting unappreciated for their efforts. The teacher uses his company management as an example: his subordinates know all the information he does, so responsibilities are shared, and the manager feels no pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Secrets, Honesty is Respect</strong>: There should be no financial secrets from your spouse. Say what&rsquo;s on your mind; this is a form of respect. Making decisions alone, regardless of success or failure, can pose a risk to the family relationship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Communication with Parents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Planning and Gentle Communication</strong>: When parents are approaching retirement age (50s-60s), you should begin discussing future financial and care arrangements. Use a caring tone and examples (like the sudden situations of neighbor Mrs. Chang or Uncle Li) to gradually &ldquo;brainwash&rdquo; them, rather than forcefully demanding management rights.</li>
<li><strong>The Role of Children</strong>: Children who have learned about finance should bravely take on the role of the family CFO (Chief Financial Officer), responsible for financial planning, investment management, and payment systems, while keeping clear accounts and reporting to the family regularly.</li>
<li><strong>Elder Care Trusts</strong>: If parents are not comfortable entrusting their money to a single child, or if the children cannot reach a consensus, consider setting up an &ldquo;Elder Care Trust.&rdquo; The bank would be responsible for management and payments, and some banks even allow specifying investment targets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Practice of Caring for Parents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevention is Better Than Cure</strong>: Care for your parents should start with daily life, paying attention to their &ldquo;eating, drinking, defecating, urinating, and sleeping.&rdquo; Take them for regular health check-ups (for the &ldquo;three highs&rdquo; - high blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar), monitor their vision (e.g., get injections for macular degeneration early, even if you have to pay out-of-pocket), hearing (e.g., get hearing aids from Costco early), knees, and other body &ldquo;parts,&rdquo; intervening at the first sign of a problem.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Sleep</strong>: Understand your parents&rsquo; sleep situation. If they don&rsquo;t sleep well, you can discuss solutions, such as trying Melatonin, and avoid sleeping pills with significant side effects.</li>
<li><strong>Health is the Children&rsquo;s Happiness</strong>: When parents are healthy and can take care of themselves, it is the greatest happiness for their children. Don&rsquo;t wait until they are bedridden to start managing; the family burden will be extremely heavy by then.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="relative group">Index Fund Performance Showdown: Why Choose QQQ?

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Astonishing Long-Term Performance Differences</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>40 years</strong>: QQQ had an annualized return of 14%, while SPY (S&amp;P 500) was only 8.95%—a huge gap.</li>
<li><strong>17 years</strong>: QQQ&rsquo;s annualized return was 15.8%, SPY/VOO/VTI was about 9.6%, while VT (Total World Stock) was a meager 5.7%.</li>
<li><strong>10 years</strong>: QQQ&rsquo;s annualized return was 18.17%, SPY was 11.8%, and VT was only 7.8%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Those who invest in QQQ might become &ldquo;billionaires,&rdquo; those in SPY are &ldquo;wealthy people,&rdquo; and those in VT might become &ldquo;poor people who think they are rich.&rdquo; If the direction is wrong, all effort is wasted.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Correction</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: What if I have already bought SPY, VOO, or VT, especially in the US where I have to pay taxes?</li>
<li><strong>Answer</strong>: You must sell! Pay for past mistakes, pay the tax once, but in return, you get much higher long-term returns in the future. Don&rsquo;t cling to the wrong assets for a lifetime just to save a little on taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Sunk Cost</strong>: It&rsquo;s like finding out the elevator is broken and switching to another one immediately, not stubbornly waiting in the broken one. It&rsquo;s also like realizing a relationship isn&rsquo;t working after five years; you can&rsquo;t continue down the wrong path just because you&rsquo;ve invested five years.</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>From Money Anxiety to Magnanimity</strong>: Taking the sharing from student Michael as an example, he used to have anxiety about money because he was afraid of spending it. After getting rich through investing, his life got better and better, but more importantly, his mindset changed. He learned to use money with magnanimity for physical and mental health and family happiness. Letting go of money anxiety can improve relationships with family.</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;C&rdquo; Investment Philosophy</strong>: Aims to eliminate poverty and people&rsquo;s anxiety about money. We should not be slaves to capital, but capitalists. &ldquo;Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right.&rdquo; We should live a worthy life.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation Principles</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash is King</strong>: Keep at least 30% in cash. Cash is the &ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark&rdquo; of investing; it can save your life.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Leverage</strong>: For those who want to use leverage but are afraid of the risk, you can start with a lower Beta (e.g., 0.5-0.7) and gradually get used to it.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy for Young People</strong>: Even with little capital, you must first establish an emergency fund. For example, if you only have 200,000 TWD but your annual living expenses are 300,000 TWD, you cannot invest this 200,000. You should save up the emergency fund first, and then invest the rest.</li>

<li>Question: I am 27 this year. How should I prepare for my parents&rsquo; (around 60) future medical expenses? About how much money is needed?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Based on my mother&rsquo;s experience (she had 6 million TWD prepared when she started needing care at age 80), and considering inflation, one parent might need about 10 million TWD in 20 years. I suggest you start now, saving at least 10,000 TWD per month for your parents, and separately save for your own retirement. More importantly, start paying attention to your parents&rsquo; health now. Take them to the metabolism department for regular check-ups (like blood sugar, cholesterol) and address hearing and vision problems promptly. Prevention is better than cure.</li>

<li>Question: The retirement account at my current company (TIAA) does not offer QQQ, but my previous company&rsquo;s retirement account (Fidelity) does. What should I do?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: First, for the account from the job you&rsquo;ve already left, you can do a Rollover into an IRA account, which will allow you to freely invest in QQQ. For your current company&rsquo;s underperforming retirement account, I suggest you stop contributing to it. You should prioritize maxing out your Roth IRA, and put the rest of your money directly into your own Brokerage Account to buy QQQ.</li>

<li>Question 1: I want to buy TQQQ, but it seems no brokerage in Taiwan allows direct purchase, only through a sub-brokerage account. Since I followed the teacher&rsquo;s advice and repatriated all my money from overseas brokerages, is it okay to buy through a sub-brokerage account now?

<li>Question 2: As my salary and property value increase, should I borrow as much as I can and invest it all in the market?

<ul>
<li>Question: After my sister took the teacher&rsquo;s class, she canceled more than a dozen insurance policies, took out a personal loan, and invested heavily in 00662 (the Taiwanese QQQ equivalent). Our family thinks she&rsquo;s &ldquo;gone off the deep end.&rdquo; Many people around us still advocate for individual stocks. May I ask why the teacher himself switched from investing in individual stocks to exclusively recommending index funds?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I invested in individual stocks for over 30 years. Although my performance was good, after taxes, I didn&rsquo;t truly beat QQQ. More critically, individual stock trading requires real-time buy/sell instructions. For a community of tens of thousands of students like we have now, I cannot provide timely notifications, which would cause losses for everyone. Therefore, abandoning complex individual stock picking, which may not even yield better results in the end, and turning to simple, transparent index investing with excellent long-term returns is the most responsible and effective method for everyone.</li>

<li>Question: The teacher mentioned that wealth will become more concentrated in the future, &ldquo;the big get bigger.&rdquo; In that case, would an ETF like 00757 (FNGS), which is even more concentrated in tech giants, be better than 00662 (QQQ)?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I don&rsquo;t recommend it. The biggest problem with 00757 is its &ldquo;unpredictability.&rdquo; Its stock selection logic is not transparent (why these 10 stocks?), and its volatility is unknown, which makes it impossible for you to do scientific asset allocation. Its performance is not necessarily better than the predictable QLD (00670L, the 2x leveraged QQQ). The so-called &ldquo;mean reversion&rdquo; does not exist between assets of different natures (e.g., apples and oranges don&rsquo;t revert to each other). Instead of investing in a fund you don&rsquo;t understand, it&rsquo;s better to build your own &ldquo;top ten&rdquo; portfolio based on QQQ&rsquo;s holdings, which has a clearer logic.</li>

<li>Question: I would like to ask the teacher&rsquo;s view on &ldquo;history.&rdquo; How should we view ancient wisdom in relation to modern development?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: I divide history into two parts. One part is timeless, spiritual wisdom (like Laozi, Zhuangzi, Socrates). This is eternal, and we should learn and think about how to &ldquo;take and use&rdquo; it in our real lives. The other part is humanity&rsquo;s animal nature (like cruelty, selfishness). I&rsquo;ve observed that this aspect has not changed from ancient times to the present, despite advances in material civilization. When we study history, the focus should be on drawing lessons and applying them, not just criticizing or admiring.</li>

<li>Question: I use a sub-brokerage account in Taiwan to buy QQQ and then never sell. Is this okay? And if I have a large home equity line of credit, is it good to keep it as an emergency fund?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: No, that&rsquo;s not okay. The problems are: 1. <strong>Taxes</strong>: When your assets grow to tens of millions, you will eventually need the money, and as soon as you sell, you will face high capital gains taxes. 2. <strong>Opportunity Cost</strong>: Keeping your HELOC credit line as cash is a huge waste. You should borrow all the money you can and invest it in the market. Even just buying short-term bonds (like 00865B in Taiwan) for arbitrage is better than letting the money sleep in the bank. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of the debt figure; look at the growth potential of your assets. The market is always at a low point. You must act immediately, right now.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Investment hesitation is the biggest mistake.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: At the beginning of the session, the teacher emphasized that the market doesn&rsquo;t wait when it&rsquo;s rising. The hesitant mentality of not buying whether the market is up or down is the biggest mistake in investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t avoid doing the right thing just to save on taxes.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When answering a student&rsquo;s question about whether to sell SPY/VOO to switch to QQQ, the teacher stressed that even if it means paying taxes, one should decisively correct wrong investment decisions to focus on the correct long-term returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must do a smart rebalance every year with leveraged funds, or you will be wiped out overnight.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When explaining how to hold leveraged ETFs like TQQQ and QLD, the teacher repeatedly emphasized that these products must be managed with an annual &ldquo;smart rebalance&rdquo; to lock in profits and control risk; otherwise, long-term holding could lead to returns diminishing to zero.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;ve read so many books, now put them to use!
&ndash; Teacher James (quoting a general manager)</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When discussing how to learn from history and philosophy, the teacher emphasized that the ultimate purpose of knowledge is practice. If you read the classics, you must think about how to apply them in your life; otherwise, no amount of knowledge is more than just garbage in your head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The market is always at a low point.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When encouraging students to overcome their fear of heights and invest immediately, the teacher pointed out that relative to the future price (e.g., QQQ potentially reaching 50,000 points), any current price should be considered a low point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Explaining the philosophy of C-position investment and financial education, the core of which is to help people break free from money anxiety and live a happy, fulfilling life where they realize their self-worth, rather than being slaves to money.</p>

<p>This session once again reinforced the core strategies and philosophy of C-position investment and financial management. In terms of investment strategy, it irrefutably demonstrated the superiority of QQQ as a core asset through detailed data comparisons, urging students to have the courage to correct past investment mistakes, even if it incurs some tax costs. On the philosophy of life and family relations, the teacher profoundly pointed out that wealth growth must go hand-in-hand with family harmony. The key to achieving this is continuous, honest financial communication built on a foundation of trust. Whether it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;constant chatter&rdquo; sharing between spouses or the patient guidance for parents, the goal is to build a family financial system based on consensus and shared responsibility. Ultimately, the course guides us back to the origin of investing: to use capital as a tool to achieve a happy and meaningful life, free from anxiety about money.</p>

      <description>In this session, James focuses on how to leverage real estate for financing, specifically discussing &amp;#39;reverse mortgages&amp;#39; for retirees and &amp;#39;investment-type home equity loans&amp;#39; for general homeowners. He details the pros and cons, suitable candidates, and operational key points for both tools, and shares practical tips for preventing real estate fraud. Additionally, the course emphasizes the immense impact of choosing the right investment vehicle (QQQ vs. SPY/VT) on future wealth, reiterates the core investment strategies of holding cash, smart rebalancing, and utilizing pledged loans, and answers various specific questions including obtaining loans with overseas income, handling mortgages after retirement, and balancing career and family.</description>

<p>The core theme of this session is <strong>how to unlock the value of real estate through financial instruments, converting fixed assets into liquid capital for investment, thereby achieving exponential wealth growth</strong>. The instructor details two methods, &ldquo;reverse mortgages&rdquo; and &ldquo;investment-type home equity loans,&rdquo; and emphasizes that in Taiwan&rsquo;s low-interest-rate environment, borrowing to invest is a powerful lever for ordinary people to accumulate wealth. At the same time, the course reiterates that future wealth gaps will be primarily determined by the choice of investment vehicles, with those investing in high-tech indexes (like the Nasdaq-100) pulling far ahead of those investing in traditional broad market indexes.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: A friend working in bank lending suggested that the instructor share the concept of &ldquo;reverse mortgages,&rdquo; which is an excellent option for many retirees who have insufficient funds but own a mortgage-free home.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of &ldquo;Investment-Type Home Equity Loans&rdquo;</strong>: For retirees without a stable source of income, applying for an &ldquo;investment-type home equity loan&rdquo; is highly risky.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Suppose you borrow TWD 10 million at a 2.4% annual interest rate, requiring TWD 240,000 in annual interest payments. However, according to our investment principles, you can only safely withdraw 2% of this TWD 10 million asset annually (which is TWD 200,000). Since the interest expense exceeds the usable amount, it results in negative cash flow, which is very risky.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of &ldquo;Reverse Mortgages&rdquo;</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: Individuals who are retired, have no income, are unable to qualify for an investment-type home equity loan, but own a mortgage-free property and have insufficient investment capital to support their retirement.</li>
<li><strong>Core Benefit</strong>: Through a reverse mortgage, you can receive a stable monthly cash flow for living expenses, while your original investment principal of several million or ten million TWD can remain untouched to continue compounding in the market. This is equivalent to &ldquo;borrowing money to live, while letting your own assets continue to grow.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Information from Taiwanese Banks</strong>: The instructor provided information from institutions like Bank of Taiwan for &ldquo;reverse mortgages,&rdquo; with interest rates around 2.2% to 2.6% and loan terms typically up to 30 years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conditions for Investment-Type Home Equity Loans</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Rate</strong>: The current rate for a general investment-type home equity loan is about 2.59%.</li>
<li><strong>Restrictions</strong>: There are requirements on the age of the property and the loan term (e.g., building age + loan term &lt; 60). This could limit young people who buy older, second-hand homes from accessing this service in the future.</li>

<li><strong>Preventive Measures</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Do Not Cancel the Mortgage Lien</strong>: Even if the mortgage is fully paid off, it is recommended not to go to the land administration office to cancel the bank&rsquo;s mortgage lien. Keeping this registered lien adds a layer of security.</li>
<li><strong>Apply for Two Services</strong>: Children can take their parents to the household registration office to apply for &ldquo;<strong>Advance Notice Registration</strong>&rdquo; (to prevent the property from being arbitrarily transferred or sold) and the &ldquo;<strong>Real-time Land Registry Alert</strong>&rdquo; service (which sends an immediate notification if there are any changes to the property&rsquo;s land registry data).</li>

<li><strong>Instructor&rsquo;s View</strong>: High living costs are a common phenomenon in the United States. Taking himself as an example, his monthly HOA fees plus utilities, internet, etc., amount to over $1,100 before even buying food. He reminds everyone to carefully inspect the property condition and contract terms and to clarify all fees before signing a lease.</li>

<li><strong>Future Wealth Will Be More Concentrated</strong>: Artificial intelligence and digital finance will accelerate the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few companies and individuals. In the future, it could be that 0.1% of the population controls 80% of the wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Choosing the Right Vehicle is Crucial</strong>: Between investing and not investing, your assets will differ by two zeros. For those who invest in indexes, the assets of those who choose the wrong indexes (like VT, VOO, SPY) versus the right one (QQQ) will also differ by two zeros in the future. People investing in high-dividend stocks or SPY may become relatively poor in the future.</li>
<li><strong>The Purpose of Asset Allocation</strong>: The quality of an asset allocation and rebalancing strategy is not determined by the strategy itself, but by <strong>future market conditions</strong>. Since we cannot predict the future, the primary purpose of asset allocation is to <strong>give you peace of mind, enabling you to endure the worst market periods (like a continuous ten-year decline)</strong>, rather than pursuing the highest short-term performance.</li>
<li><strong>On Educating Children</strong>: When facing a child&rsquo;s problem, analyze whether it&rsquo;s a lack of &ldquo;ability&rdquo; or a lack of &ldquo;willingness.&rdquo; A lack of ability requires &ldquo;teaching,&rdquo; while a lack of willingness requires &ldquo;encouragement.&rdquo; Plant good seeds and nurture them with love, companionship, and positive energy.</li>
<li><strong>Become a Capitalist, Free from Money Worries</strong>: By understanding investment and becoming a capitalist, you can free yourself and the next generation from the fear and anxiety of money, achieve generational wealth, and possess the right to be happy.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Seniors in Taiwan are in a pitiful situation now because landlords, fearing that an elderly person might pass away in the property and turn it into a &ldquo;stigmatized property&rdquo; affecting its value, are unwilling to rent to them.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This is actually an excuse by landlords; legally, a natural death does not constitute a stigmatized property. The fundamental problem is poverty. If you become wealthy, you won&rsquo;t have housing problems. The lack of investment and financial literacy education in Taiwan makes it difficult for many people to accumulate wealth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: I bought 00662 at a high point of 93 earlier this year. Even though the US QQQ has reached a new high, my 00662 has not yet broken even because the Taiwan dollar has appreciated. I feel anxious. Should I use a sub-brokerage account to buy the US stock QQQ directly?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: This is a normal phenomenon caused by exchange rates. If you convert the price of QQQ at its peak back then using the higher exchange rate at the time (e.g., 33), you would find that its value in TWD also hasn&rsquo;t reached a new high. It&rsquo;s essentially the same, so there&rsquo;s no need to worry about exchange rates. If you&rsquo;re in Taiwan, just buy 00662 with TWD. Buy whenever you have money, and don&rsquo;t worry about exchange rates or short-term market fluctuations.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: I have a USD-denominated insurance policy with a 3.5% annualized return that I want to cancel, but I&rsquo;m worried about the unfavorable exchange rate for converting it back to TWD now. This money is for my child. Should I allocate it as 50% 00662 and 50% 00670L (a leveraged ETF)?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: A 3.5% return is too low; you should cancel it decisively. Don&rsquo;t worry about the short-term exchange rate, because after you convert to TWD and buy 00662, the nature of the asset reverts to a USD asset. For a 30-year investment for your child, the simplest and safest way is to buy 100% 00662 and hold it for the long term. If you must include leverage, you can, but you must understand its risks and rebalance properly. Otherwise, simply holding 00662 is better.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: He has been following the instructor for nearly two years, and his assets have doubled. He uses a 4-3-3 allocation, holding 30% in cash (about 10 years of living expenses), which makes him completely indifferent to market ups and downs and gives him great peace of mind. He also shared a real-life case of his 72-year-old elder who applied for a &ldquo;reverse mortgage&rdquo;: for a TWD 7 million house, they can receive TWD 17,000 per month for 23 years. He believes this allows the elder to age with dignity and also frees up the children&rsquo;s funds. The filial piety money saved by the children can be invested to create even greater wealth.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: This is an excellent sharing. This is the essence of a &ldquo;reverse mortgage.&rdquo; If the children invest the saved TWD 17,000 per month, at a 12% annualized rate of return, it will grow to over TWD 52 million in 30 years. This is equivalent to using a TWD 7 million loan from the bank to create tens of millions in additional wealth—a very smart financial move.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Fubon Bank has a 20-year revolving investment-type home equity loan product. She thinks it&rsquo;s better for young people than a reverse mortgage and suggests everyone look into it.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: There is no capital gains tax in Taiwan. In retirement, will it still be necessary to live off funds from a stock-pledged loan? Can I just sell the bond portion of my asset allocation for expenses?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: You don&rsquo;t have to use a pledged loan, but your wealth will grow much slower. He gives an example: with TWD 50 million in assets, if you sell 2% each year to live on (assuming a 10% rate of return), it will grow to TWD 2.2 billion in 40 years. If you live off a pledged loan and leave the principal untouched (assuming a 12% rate of return), it will grow to TWD 4.6 billion in 40 years—more than double the amount. The risk of pledging is controllable, but the return is enormous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: If I want to withdraw 3% annually, but my total assets are not yet large, should I switch to the less volatile SPY?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: No need. You can achieve this by adjusting the Beta of your asset allocation, for example, by using a 70-30 or 4-2-4 allocation while still holding QQQ, and you can still safely withdraw 3%.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: She discovered that an older colleague&rsquo;s retirement account balance was only one-third of hers. The reason was that the colleague chose a very conservative investment model, which fell less but also grew much less. This made her deeply realize the importance of choosing the right investment vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: She was most shocked to learn about the Pledge Asset Line (PAL) from the instructor and immediately opened one. She believes people should not be afraid of PAL. Compared to taking on a huge mortgage with a small down payment, PAL is a small loan based on a substantial asset foundation, making it much less risky. She compares PAL to a &ldquo;future employer&rdquo;—whenever you need money, you just go and get it. It&rsquo;s very convenient.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: An excellent sharing. This is the core of financial operations. In Taiwan, with such low interest rates, anyone with property must get an investment-type home equity loan or a reverse mortgage. Not borrowing this cheap money is a huge waste. You can only become truly wealthy if you know how to borrow money safely.</li>

After this session, she decided to immediately research applying for a &ldquo;reverse mortgage.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: She has a &ldquo;mental block&rdquo; about selling her 0050 (Taiwan 50 ETF). She feels that as a Taiwanese person, not holding 0050 means she lacks a &ldquo;sense of participation,&rdquo; and she feels very conflicted.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Emotional matters cannot be measured in money. But from a financial perspective, you should deal with it as soon as possible. He suggests she first go and set up the reverse mortgage. As for pledged loans, she can start by trying a small amount, like pledging TWD 1 million to borrow TWD 100,000 for a trip, just to experience it and gradually develop the habit of &ldquo;borrowing for consumption, letting the principal grow.&rdquo;</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: He just secured a TWD 7.5 million investment-type home equity loan and invested TWD 6 million in 00662. He wants to keep his monthly interest payment around TWD 10,000 and is struggling with a decision: should he use the entire TWD 6 million as his investment base for a 7-3 allocation, or use only TWD 4 million for the allocation and leave the remaining TWD 2 million untouched in the loan account to reduce interest?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: All loan interest should be paid from your salary. The invested TWD 6 million should be managed as a single portfolio. Given that he is still young, he should adopt a more aggressive allocation, such as 5-2-3 or 4-3-3. The cash portion of the allocation (e.g., 30%, which is TWD 1.8 million) should be invested in a high-yield money market fund (like 00865B, with an annualized return of about 4.5%), not left in the non-interest-bearing loan account.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: When rebalancing, if the market drops and I need to add to my leveraged ETF position, should the cash come from the cash position within my brokerage account or be transferred from an external bank account?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: The cash comes from the cash portion of your entire investment portfolio. Ideally, the leveraged fund is in a tax-advantaged account (like an IRA), and the cash for re-buying should also come from the cash position within that same account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: I can start accessing my 401K next year and plan to roll it into an IRA. At that time, living expenses and taxes might strain my cash flow. Should I use a PAL to cover these? What if a major market crash exhausts my PAL limit?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: This is why you keep 30% cash. If a market crash occurs and your brokerage account (where the PAL is) faces a margin call, you should transfer cash (e.g., by selling SWVXX) from your tax-advantaged account like an IRA to the brokerage account as collateral, not transfer stocks. SWVXX has a very high pledge rate (96%), which can effectively boost your collateral value and borrowing capacity. The asset allocation and Beta of your entire investment portfolio (brokerage + IRA) should be calculated and viewed as a whole.</li>

Then, make a fixed monthly transfer from Bank A to Bank B&rsquo;s account (e.g., TWD 7,000 or 10,000).

However, if the withdrawn money isn&rsquo;t even enough to live on, you should consider selling some assets to pay off the mortgage or converting the house into a &ldquo;reverse mortgage&rdquo; to improve your cash flow.</li>

<p>In the future, it could be that 0.1% of the population will control 80% of the world&rsquo;s wealth&hellip; If you buy VT, VOO, SPY, these people will become poor in the future&hellip; Those of you who buy QQQ will have two more zeros in your assets than those people.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view points out the trend of extreme wealth polarization and emphasizes that choosing a high-growth tech index (QQQ) over traditional broad-market indexes is the key determinant of future wealth magnitude.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our performance is not determined by our asset allocation and rebalancing method; it&rsquo;s determined by what the future market will be, which we don&rsquo;t know. Therefore, the main purpose of our asset allocation is to find a state that gives you peace of mind, allowing you to get through the worst of markets.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view clarifies the fundamental purpose of asset allocation—it&rsquo;s for risk management and the investor&rsquo;s psychological comfort, enabling them to stay in the market for the long haul, rather than for predicting and chasing the highest short-term returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just think of the PAL (Pledge Asset Line) as your future employer. Whenever a month is up or anytime you want to get money, you just go to your PAL to get it.

<blockquote>
<p>Not selling is your ancestor.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>With a humorous and colloquial phrase, the instructor emphasizes the extreme importance of long-term holding and avoiding the sale of assets, subverting the traditional wisdom that &ldquo;knowing when to sell makes you a master.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to get into the habit of borrowing money.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This view challenges the traditional &ldquo;debt-free is worry-free&rdquo; concept, emphasizing that in a low-interest-rate environment, learning to use leverage safely and intelligently by borrowing to invest is a crucial habit for accelerating wealth accumulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was born in Taiwan, and if I don&rsquo;t own 0050, it feels like I&rsquo;m not participating. I&rsquo;m just very conflicted internally.

<p>This session reinforces the core investment philosophy of CLEC while introducing more specific wealth-growth strategies. Through the cases of &ldquo;reverse mortgages&rdquo; and &ldquo;investment-type home equity loans,&rdquo; the instructor vividly demonstrated how to unlock seemingly &ldquo;dormant&rdquo; real estate and turn it into fuel for wealth growth. The course not only provided operational guidance but, more importantly, continued to shape the investor&rsquo;s mindset: to break the fear of debt and understand the power of leverage; to abandon focus on short-term fluctuations and concentrate on choosing the right long-term track; and to recognize that the essence of wealth is cognition. Only by continuously improving financial literacy can one stand invincible in the future tide of wealth.</p>

<li><strong>A Case Study of Losses by Taiwanese Day Traders</strong>: James cites data from the first half of 2025 in Taiwan to illustrate the harm of short-term trading (day trading).
<ul>
<li><strong>Superficial Profit</strong>: Day traders made a profit of about NT$30 billion from price differences.</li>
<li><strong>Actual Huge Loss</strong>: However, they paid a staggering NT$21.4 billion in securities transaction tax and NT$20.3 billion in commission fees.</li>
<li><strong>Final Result</strong>: The total loss amounted to NT$11.7 billion. This proves that short-term trading is almost a guaranteed losing game after all costs are deducted. Traders often only remember the &ldquo;good feeling&rdquo; of a single trade but overlook the total costs.</li>

<li><strong>The Tax Dilemma of the Average Person</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>First Exploitation</strong>: When you earn income (e.g., $1 million), you are first hit with a high income tax (e.g., 40%).</li>
<li><strong>Second Exploitation</strong>: You invest the after-tax money ($600,000), and any profits are then hit with capital gains tax (e.g., 25%).</li>
<li>Throughout a lifetime, assets are eroded by various taxes (VAT, estate tax, etc.), and you may only be left with a small fraction in the end.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>The Wealthy&rsquo;s Zero-Tax Strategy</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Hold Assets</strong>: Hold appreciating stock assets (e.g., $1 million in QQQ).</li>
<li><strong>Borrow Against Assets</strong>: Use the stocks as collateral to borrow money from a bank for living expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Taxes</strong>: The borrowed money is <strong>debt</strong>, not <strong>income</strong>, so no tax is due. Meanwhile, the stock assets held as collateral continue to grow in the market. This is the most favorable wealth-building cycle in the world.</li>

<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: The biggest problem with individual stocks is not performance, but that <strong>you never know when to sell</strong> and <strong>you cannot effectively pass it down through generations</strong>. You can&rsquo;t teach your children when to sell TSMC; they might panic and sell at a low point. In contrast, the strategy for index funds (hold long-term, never sell) is simple, clear, and easy to pass on. Even Warren Buffett advised his family to invest in the SPY index fund after his death because his stock-picking ability cannot be inherited.</li>

<li>Question: I run a small business in Taiwan, pay a lot in taxes, and the work is very hard. I want to retire and put all my assets into 00662, but I&rsquo;m afraid of feeling insecure without cash flow. What should I do?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: First, you need to calculate your business&rsquo;s <strong>net profit margin</strong>. If your net profit margin isn&rsquo;t significantly higher than QQQ&rsquo;s annualized return (around 18%, say, less than 30%), then continuing the business doesn&rsquo;t make much sense, as you&rsquo;re taking on huge risks and hardship for a lower return. Regarding the cash flow issue, you can solve it with <strong>asset allocation</strong>: hold 30% of your total assets (or enough to cover 15 years of living expenses) in cash or cash equivalents (like 00865B), and invest the remaining 70% in 00662. This way, you&rsquo;ll have enough cash to live on, while the stock portion continues to grow. In the long run, you won&rsquo;t run out of assets.</li>

<li>Question: My son is 30. He can contribute $7,000 to a Roth IRA and $23,000 to a SEP IRA. How should he allocate this?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>I strongly recommend avoiding any Traditional (pre-tax) accounts</strong>. The tax you save now will be paid back at a higher rate in the future. First, you should find a brokerage that offers a <strong>Roth SEP IRA</strong>. If you can&rsquo;t find one, then <strong>do not contribute to the SEP IRA</strong>. It&rsquo;s better to put the money in a regular Brokerage Account. Assets in a brokerage account are never taxed until they are sold, whereas money in a Traditional account is subject to Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) and taxes after age 75. As for allocation, all Roth accounts can buy QQQ. For the Roth IRA, given its small amount and long-term dollar-cost averaging nature, you could consider the more aggressive <strong>TQQQ</strong>.</li>

<li>Question 1: An investment scenario: A brother invests 10 million and withdraws 200,000 annually. The market then drops 50%, leaving his assets at 5.8 million. At this point, his younger brother invests 5.8 million with the same allocation. Can the younger brother also withdraw 200,000 annually?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: <strong>Yes</strong>. Because the younger brother entered the market after a major crash when the risk was lower, he is &ldquo;luckier.&rdquo; The older brother initially used a low 2% withdrawal rate precisely to create a buffer for such a crash. After the risk event has occurred, the younger brother&rsquo;s withdrawal rate, although seemingly higher (about 3.45%), is based on a different risk foundation, so it is feasible.</li>
</ul>

<li>Question 2: The Taiwan dollar has appreciated, making it seem like 00662 hasn&rsquo;t recovered to its previous high. Can I, for psychological purposes, add back the currency loss and consider it to have broken even?

<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: If you&rsquo;re just doing it for &ldquo;fun&rdquo; and are willing to pay the &ldquo;ticket price&rdquo; (i.e., giving up the massive potential returns from long-term holding of QQQ), then of course you can. But this is just making small money while giving up the opportunity to make big money.

<li>Sharing: Influenced by him, his sister has also begun to understand and accept the philosophy of index investing, stating that if just half the people in a family become a big tree, they can support each other.</li>
<li>Question: How can I train my brain to see the essence of things like the teacher does?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: First, <strong>admit your own ignorance</strong> and stay curious. Then, expand your knowledge boundaries through <strong>extensive reading and reflecting on experiences</strong>. When your knowledge accumulates to a certain level, you will see things from different dimensions, such as examining current decisions through the lens of time. When your knowledge base is large enough, wisdom will naturally &ldquo;explode.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Question: I&rsquo;m preparing to retire in four or five years. My current asset allocation has a beta of about 0.8. Do I need to adjust it? Also, I received a penalty notice from the IRS for over-contributing to my Roth IRA. What should I do?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: 1. If you are close to retirement and the assets corresponding to a 0.8 beta are sufficient for your retirement life, then it&rsquo;s fine; you can maintain it. 2. After your income exceeds the limit, you cannot contribute directly to a Roth IRA. You should use the &ldquo;Backdoor Roth IRA&rdquo; method: first contribute to a Traditional IRA, then immediately convert it to a Roth IRA.</li>

<li>Question: What if my company&rsquo;s Roth 401K doesn&rsquo;t have QQQ? How should my daughter&rsquo;s investments be allocated?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Reply: 1. If the company doesn&rsquo;t have good investment options, don&rsquo;t contribute (except to get the full match). Put the money in your own brokerage account and buy QQQ. 2. For your daughter&rsquo;s money, besides buying mostly QQQ, her Roth IRA account, being a small, long-term, regular investment, could consider buying QLD or TQQQ to boost returns.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>We borrow money to spend without paying taxes, and our money in the stock market assets grows forever, always up, how great is that! This is the best thing in the world.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote brilliantly summarizes the core advantage of using asset-backed loans for consumption: achieving tax exemption for spending while enjoying the compound growth of assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We only need to get rich once in our lifetime. We don&rsquo;t need to be rich from the start; just get rich slowly.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This sentence conveys the patience and calm mindset of long-term investing, opposing the speculative psychology of rushing for success and emphasizing that wealth accumulation is a continuous and steady process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The highest skill in investing is to exist in a state of &rsquo;non-eventfulness,&rsquo; where the market basically doesn&rsquo;t exist&hellip; The market&rsquo;s ups and downs have nothing to do with us.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>This describes the ultimate psychological state a long-term investor should aspire to: being completely unaffected by short-term market fluctuations because their investment strategy is independent of short-term movements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you look at anything from a long-term perspective, you will see it clearly.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>In answering how to see the essence of things, James emphasizes the importance of the time dimension. A decision may seem reasonable in the present, but when viewed over a span of decades, the conclusion might be completely different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can make 20 billion from short-term trading, can you really get that 20 billion? If you have 1 million now and you can&rsquo;t get 20 billion in 60 years, then don&rsquo;t do it, you&rsquo;re wasting your time. Because you can have 20 billion by doing nothing.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>When discussing short-term trading with a student, James uses a high-impact numerical comparison to reveal the enormous opportunity cost difference between short-term trading and long-term index holding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned one sentence now, which is, &lsquo;I might be wrong&rsquo;&hellip; Only when we acknowledge our ignorance do we begin to learn.
&ndash; James</p></blockquote>
<p>At the end of the session, this quote shared by James demonstrates the humility and open-mindedness of an investment master, emphasizing that admitting ignorance is the starting point for continuous learning and progress.</p>

<p>This session was an intensive training in mindset and strategy. James once again emphasized the overwhelming advantage of the core strategy of long-term holding of index funds (QQQ) and used detailed data to reveal the inevitable failure of short-term trading. The highlight of this session was the clear explanation of the &ldquo;wealthy&rsquo;s tax strategy&rdquo;—asset-backed loans—providing investors with a path to achieve both wealth growth and tax optimization. The entire session was imbued with the investment philosophy of &ldquo;Persistence, Patience, and Faith,&rdquo; and through interactive Q&amp;A with numerous students, it addressed a series of specific issues from asset allocation, retirement planning, and children&rsquo;s education to international tax matters, vividly demonstrating how to integrate investment wisdom into real-life decision-making.</p>

      <description>In this session, Teacher James emphasizes the importance of maintaining a long-term optimistic mindset in investing, sharing a transcendent attitude of &amp;#39;it has nothing to do with me&amp;#39; when facing market volatility. He provides a detailed interpretation of the core principles of asset allocation, especially the strategic significance of cash reserves, and discusses how to adjust investment strategies at different life stages. Additionally, he recommends books and films to improve one&amp;#39;s state of mind and answers specific questions from students about asset allocation, pledging, retirement planning, career choices, and preventing financial fraud.</description>

<p>This session revolves around &ldquo;The Long-term Practice of Investment Mindset and Asset Allocation.&rdquo; The core message is that investors should cultivate a transcendent mindset of &ldquo;it has nothing to do with me,&rdquo; remaining calm in the face of external factors like international situations and economic data, and firmly believing that the market will trend upwards and reach new highs in the long run. It emphasizes achieving financial freedom through reasonable asset allocation (e.g., Nasdaq 100 index funds combined with ample cash) and passive management, and drawing strength for life and investment from wisdom such as &ldquo;I might be wrong&rdquo; and &ldquo;life is worthwhile.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Market Irrelevance Theory</strong>: Macro factors like international situations, financial reports, economic data, and interest rate decisions have no direct correlation with an individual investor&rsquo;s long-term success. One should adopt a mindset of &ldquo;it all has nothing to do with me.&rdquo; Market volatility is normal and not worth worrying about, as you can&rsquo;t control it anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Always Be Extremely Optimistic</strong>: Firmly believe that the market will inevitably rise and set new historical highs in the long run. Investing requires patience, and wealth is worth the trouble and the wait.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended Books/Films for the Mind</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>&ldquo;I Might Be Wrong&rdquo;</strong> (The Illumination of a Forest Sage): This book recounts the life insights of a man (from Europe, as the teacher recalls) who spent over a decade (perhaps 14 or 16 years) as a monk in a Thai forest. The core takeaway is to tell yourself &ldquo;I might be wrong&rdquo; three times before arguing or getting angry, to calm your mind and self-reflect. It emphasizes practicing the state of &ldquo;no-self&rdquo; and learning to live harmoniously with all kinds of people.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Life is Worthwhile&rdquo;</strong> (Audiobook): This book contains the professional insights and life experiences of an elderly female Japanese psychiatrist. Through numerous patient cases, it explores how many psychological barriers stem from &ldquo;attachment.&rdquo; Her life experiences (e.g., maintaining a less-than-perfect marriage until her husband passed away in his 70s so that both parents could stand on the stage at their children&rsquo;s weddings) are thought-provoking. The core message is to let go of attachments and appreciate life. The teacher believes that, aside from the somewhat fatalistic view on marriage, the book is very beneficial for one&rsquo;s outlook on life.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Boredom is the Highest State</strong>: &ldquo;Hold stocks in your hand, but not their prices in your heart.&rdquo; True investing should be boring, requiring only 5 minutes of operation and review each year. If it feels exciting, you&rsquo;re likely speculating or gambling, as if you&rsquo;re in Las Vegas.</li>
<li><strong>Coping with Anxiety</strong>: Don&rsquo;t create your own troubles in life. If you can handle something, face it and get it done. If you can&rsquo;t, since it&rsquo;s beyond your control, let it go without worry.</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Importance of Cash is King</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>For Retirees</strong>: It&rsquo;s recommended to hold total assets equivalent to 50 times your annual expenses. Of this, 30% of your assets (equivalent to 15 years of living expenses) should be held in cash or short-term treasury bonds. With 15 years of living expenses in cash, nothing in the world concerns you.</li>
<li><strong>For Working Individuals</strong>: You usually can&rsquo;t hold 15 years&rsquo; worth of cash. You should continue to save and invest, and the world&rsquo;s affairs also have nothing to do with you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Ultimate Perspective of Life</strong>: In life-or-death moments (like the last day of your life), wealth, stock losses, and asset security become irrelevant. Therefore, don&rsquo;t worry excessively about things you can&rsquo;t control in daily life.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Asset Allocation Principles (Pledged Investing)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Beta Control</strong>: The initial Beta of your asset allocation should not exceed 1.0. For example, a 40% non-leveraged fund (QQQ) + 30% leveraged fund (QLD) + 30% cash (433 allocation) is an aggressive setup. A 40% QQQ + 20% QLD + 40% cash (424 allocation, Beta 0.8) is also a solid choice. Aggressive allocations like 442, where the Beta might exceed 1.2, are not recommended at the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Proportion Limits</strong>: The market value of the leveraged fund should not exceed that of the non-leveraged fund, nor should it exceed the cash position.</li>
<li><strong>Prudent Choices</strong>: Even without using leveraged funds, a pledged allocation like 70% QQQ + 30% cash, or 60% QQQ + 40% cash, can withstand risk tests. Prioritize stability, with returns being secondary.</li>
<li><strong>Coping with Extreme Scenarios</strong>: This allocation must be able to withstand a market downturn lasting 10 years, like the one in 2000 (in reality, it took about 13-15 years for the market to fully recover and significantly surpass its previous high).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Role of Cash</strong>: Cash is key to protecting the safety of your long-term investments (the &ldquo;army&rdquo; of non-leveraged funds and the &ldquo;marines&rdquo; of leveraged funds).</li>
<li><strong>The Worst-Case Scenario Principle</strong>: Envision the worst possible situation and create a plan to deal with it. Once you have a solution, anxiety will diminish. For example, if you get laid off, the worst case is being unable to find a job for a year. Plan how to prepare funds and how to find a temporary job for cash flow. For disasters beyond your control that you can&rsquo;t prevent (like a nuclear war, as Buffett mentioned, or a meteor hitting Earth), worrying is useless, so let it go.</li>
<li><strong>A Long-Term Investor&rsquo;s Perspective</strong>: Don&rsquo;t fear market downturns; instead, fear that the market rises too quickly, preventing you from buying enough (like the market&rsquo;s rapid rebound after the tariff war). Downturns are buying opportunities. Resolutely do not sell core assets (like QQQ, 00662). It takes multiple experiences (e.g., 7 major slumps) to learn to buy the dip. You can choose not to buy, but you must never sell.</li>
<li><strong>Discipline for Leveraged Investing</strong>: A reminder that for leveraged investing, the initial cash allocation must exceed 30% (40% is also fine), with limits on the proportion of leveraged funds and a Beta not exceeding 1.0. This is emphasized because too many people ask the same questions and make allocation mistakes.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Importance of Accompaniment</strong>: Investment success isn&rsquo;t just talk; it requires long-term accompaniment and guidance. Teacher James is dedicated to this, hoping to awaken more people to capitalism and that his followers will pass on the philosophy, change the world, and free themselves and those around them from financial worries.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Resources</strong>: Newcomers are advised to start with videos 00451 &ldquo;An Investment Lecture for Value Investors,&rdquo; 00398, 399, 400, 401, etc., and understand them in the context of the current market. The main recommendation is the Nasdaq 100 index fund (like QQQ), combined with cash or short-term treasury bonds. Relevant handouts and links will be provided on the Clubhouse message board and in the pinned comment on YouTube.</li>

Subscriptions and likes help promote the videos to a wider audience. Although the click-through rate is not high (about 5.5%), it is still an important way to spread the word.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: I&rsquo;ve watched every episode this year and find that the Clubhouse platform has the most comprehensive information and links. YouTube Music is also a good experience, but finding consecutive episodes on YouTube can be a bit inconvenient. I hope there could be a central place for all handouts and links shared by the teacher.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: The YouTube channel has playlists, such as the &ldquo;Weekly ClubHouse&rdquo; series which already has 39 entries and can be played in order. There is also a playlist for short videos with 595 clips. Using playlists makes it easy to listen continuously.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 1: In the smart rebalancing model you mentioned, during an uptrend, 30% of the profits from QLD are moved to SGOV, and during a downtrend, 2% of SGOV is moved to QLD. Is this 2% related to the previously mentioned &ldquo;using 2% of your assets annually for living expenses&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: In smart rebalancing, during an up year, you move 30% of that year&rsquo;s appreciation from the leveraged fund (like QLD) into cash (like SGOV). In a down year, you move 2% of your total assets (equivalent to a portion of living expenses or a planned investment amount) from cash into the leveraged fund. For retirees, the core principle is to ensure your cash reserve can last at least 15 years, because after a market peak, it might take up to 15 years for a non-leveraged fund (QQQ) to have a high probability of doubling. For example, if you start with 50% cash and 50% QQQ, and the market falls for several years while you rebalance, you must ensure the remaining cash can still cover living expenses for (15 years - years passed). A strategy of 70% QQQ + 30% cash, without touching the cash for 15 years, is another option. The key is the &ldquo;15-year cash buffer.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: The total assets of the U.S. are about $200 trillion (200T), with the stock market being about $50T. What comprises the other $150T? Is there an index to track the flow of funds between the stock market and cash?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The remaining assets include real estate, mineral resources, various physical assets, etc. There is currently no specific public index tracking this kind of macro fund flow. The total assets of the U.S. are enormous and grow substantially each year (e.g., by $20-30T). Its debt (about $36T) is not a major issue relative to its total assets and annual growth, so the public shouldn&rsquo;t worry too much. In comparison, an individual investor&rsquo;s balance sheet risk might be higher. As for the claim that Social Security is going bankrupt, I&rsquo;ve been hearing that for 40 years. There&rsquo;s no need to worry; the U.S. can solve it. The Social Security fund itself is more like a pay-as-you-go system, where contributions from new workers pay for retirees&rsquo; benefits, rather than a massive investment fund.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: I am an investor from mainland China and also a Christian. Last year, I sold a primary residence and invested the funds. I feel like a steward of money with a responsibility to manage it well. I originally planned to dollar-cost average into USD and have opened an account in Hong Kong. After listening to your classes recently, I&rsquo;ve been deeply moved by your selfless dedication and strongly agree with your investment philosophy. My current plan is to use my wife&rsquo;s and my annual $50,000 foreign exchange quotas to transfer funds to Longbridge Securities and gradually buy assets like QQQ. I&rsquo;ve also bought some 513100 in the domestic A-share market. Our total capital is about 3 million RMB. I plan to deploy most of it in Longbridge Securities within six months, keeping a small portion domestically. Is this a reasonable approach? I considered using HSBC for pledging, but the threshold is high (over 1 million HKD), transferring from Longbridge to HSBC has fees, and HSBC&rsquo;s management fees might be high. I plan to wait until I have enough capital to transfer it to HSBC all at once.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Your approach is reasonable. You can first accumulate assets in Longbridge Securities and then transfer them in one go when your capital reaches HSBC&rsquo;s pledging threshold or when you are ready to pledge. This is more economical. Investors in mainland China generally lack financial literacy; many get hurt after entering the market blindly and then stay away, including Kevin&rsquo;s own wife who suffered losses in the stock market in 2015 due to the wrong philosophy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing 2: I deeply resonate with your sharing on both the &ldquo;technique&rdquo; (术) of investing and the &ldquo;way&rdquo; (道) of life. I also listen to Pastor Stephen Tong&rsquo;s sermons and have many reflections. Thank you for your efforts. You&rsquo;ve mentioned Confucius and Zhuangzi; I was wondering if you&rsquo;ve come across Pastor Tong&rsquo;s sharing on these topics?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Thank you for sharing, Kevin. I haven&rsquo;t specifically listened to Pastor Stephen Tong&rsquo;s sharing, but I maintain an open and learning attitude towards various religious and philosophical thoughts (Christianity, Buddhism, etc.). If it&rsquo;s recommended to me, I&rsquo;ll listen, as I believe all great truths are interconnected. The core of investing is this: we own companies (like the 100 companies represented by QQQ), and we shouldn&rsquo;t sell them easily just because of external opinions on their stock prices (Mr. Market&rsquo;s neurotic quotes). Focus on long-term holding and accumulating shares, just like accumulating real estate, but with better liquidity. Investing should be passive and simple. You only need to spend 5 minutes at the end of the year (e.g., Dec 31st or the market open on Jan 2nd or 3rd) to rebalance once. Avoid emotional trading based on short-term market fluctuations, which will only get you into trouble, like being influenced by Mr. Market and becoming a &ldquo;lunatic&rsquo;s lunatic.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Question 1: In your Excel model for maintenance margin calculation, are leveraged funds excluded? Is this also the case in Taiwan?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes, in the models of U.S. brokerages, leveraged funds usually cannot be used to calculate maintenance margin because they cannot be pledged themselves. If a Taiwanese brokerage allows leveraged funds to be pledged, its risk tolerance would be better, and the calculated maintenance margin might include the leveraged portion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: My investment journey has been: 0056 (high-dividend) -&gt; 0050 (Taiwan 50) -&gt; 00646 (S&amp;P 500 ETF) -&gt; 00662 (Nasdaq 100 ETF). I recently re-listened to one of your earlier sessions (possibly 00451 or another early one) where you mentioned that if one doesn&rsquo;t have enough money, they could buy 0056 and live off the 4% annual dividend for retirement. Did I misunderstand? It feels like I&rsquo;ve come full circle.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You didn&rsquo;t mishear. Different strategies apply to different life stages and asset sizes. If you are still relatively young, you can use a 433 (QQQ non-leveraged, QLD leveraged, cash) allocation for aggressive growth. If you are close to retirement and your assets are not enough to support a 2% annual withdrawal (i.e., total assets 50 times your annual expenses)—for example, you need 1 million per year but have less than 50 million, maybe only 30 million—then a less volatile option like 00646 (S&amp;P 500) with a 3% annual withdrawal might be a choice. If your assets are even smaller (e.g., only 20 or 25 million), then a high-dividend ETF like 0056, withdrawing the 4% dividend to supplement your living expenses, is a reluctant but realistic option. The 0056 plan is for special cases of insufficient assets; the mainstream, ideal allocation is still centered around QQQ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: If I am about to retire and the market happens to be in a major downturn, at a low point in the model, how should I reposition my assets and plan my living expense withdrawals?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You should base your 2% annual living expense calculation on the total asset value at the market&rsquo;s peak before your retirement. For example, if you had 50 million at the peak and planned to spend 1 million a year. Even if the market then drops for three years and your assets shrink to 25 million, you should still try to maintain your 1 million annual living standard (if your cash reserves allow). Because the market has already been down for several years, the risk is actually lower. You&rsquo;ve passed a three-year window, and you should trust that the market will recover in the coming cycle (15 years minus the years passed).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 4: I am a Taiwanese investor and I buy 00662 with TWD. If the TWD appreciates significantly in the future, will my assets shrink as a result?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: In the long run (e.g., 20, 30, or even over 40 years), the impact of currency fluctuations tends to approach zero. For instance, the TWD/USD exchange rate has historically fluctuated between 25 and 33. Your buying and selling (or spending) is a continuous process, not a single point in time. So, don&rsquo;t worry too much about currency issues; it&rsquo;s not within our consideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 5: There&rsquo;s a U.S. law (the student mentioned &ldquo;Law 899,&rdquo; possibly referring to FATCA or another tax law for foreigners), will it affect us Taiwanese investors?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: That (usually referring to FATCA, etc.) has little to do with Taiwanese people, so don&rsquo;t worry. It mainly targets countries with unequal tax treaties or reciprocal relationships with the U.S., like some G7 countries in Europe (Germany, France, UK, etc.).</li>

<li>Sharing: Thanks for your previous advice on my work issue; my mindset at work has improved a lot. I recall reading the book &ldquo;I Might Be Wrong&rdquo; (the author is Swedish) and noted down two points: 1. Secular success doesn&rsquo;t necessarily bring happiness. 2. Focusing on your breath can train your brain. I didn&rsquo;t quite understand it back then.</li>
<li>Question 1: With your rich experience and having reached your current level, what do you think ultimate happiness is? Also, there are many methods for practicing breathing now (like in yoga); do you have any specific experience with learning to breathe?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ul>
<li><strong>Breathing</strong>: It&rsquo;s very simple, just &ldquo;observe your breath&rdquo; (观呼吸). Notice your own inhales and exhales, know that you are breathing. This is observing the breath. Doing so will naturally clear your mind, eliminate distracting thoughts, and enter a state of &ldquo;presence,&rdquo; a relaxed state focused on the now. We often forget we are breathing during the day, which means we are in a tense state.</li>
<li><strong>Happiness</strong>: Happiness is not determined by secular success or external evaluation. The value of a stock has nothing to do with me. The only thing to focus on is yourself. True happiness comes from within. Practice methods: 1. Observe your breath. 2. Practice introspection (similar to meditation or Christian prayer), empty your mind. 3. Relax your entire body (from head to toe), you can lie down, sit in a chair, or sit cross-legged. 4. Enter a hypnotic state (possible after long practice). 5. In the hypnotic state, give yourself positive affirmations (Re-programming), for example, tell yourself &ldquo;I am happy, I am happy, I am happy,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am wealthy, I am wealthy, I am wealthy,&rdquo; &ldquo;All the money in the world is mine, all the money in the world is mine, all the money in the world is mine,&rdquo; &ldquo;All the market&rsquo;s money is mine,&rdquo; &ldquo;My stocks will always go up, up, up, up, only up and never down.&rdquo; Curve your lips upwards, practice smiling. Happiness needs practice. This is the basic skill of hypnotherapy. I recommend the &ldquo;Rachel&rsquo;s Hypnosis Channel&rdquo; on YouTube, which has many guided sessions for different needs (like improving sleep, increasing wealth, relaxation).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: I previously had some money in Firstrade (about 4 million TWD, 5-6% of my total assets). Recently, I&rsquo;ve heard some concerns about overseas brokerages and plan to wire this money back to Taiwan. My current asset allocation is 433. After this money comes back, should I directly convert it to TWD and buy 00670L (Taiwan&rsquo;s Nasdaq leveraged ETF), or should I use this &ldquo;small amount of money&rdquo; to invest in QLD (since the amount is not large, it won&rsquo;t exceed the 7.5 million TWD tax exemption for overseas income by much)? I want to slightly adjust my overall allocation from 433 to 424.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: As long as your total cash reserve remains above 30%, the market value of your leveraged fund does not exceed your non-leveraged fund or your cash position, and the overall Beta of your portfolio does not exceed 1.0, you can proceed as you wish.</li>

<li>Sharing: I always wanted to be a &ldquo;big shot&rdquo; (senior manager), so I left a large company for a VP role at a small Singaporean firm. My salary doubled, but my workload also doubled. I was basically working 7 days a week, 18 hours a day, with no personal time, not even on Sundays or evenings. What was worse, in my third or fourth week, during a meeting with the company&rsquo;s CTO, he was extremely rude (saying things like &ldquo;a one-year-old child could have made your presentation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;what did I hire you for?&rdquo;). I was very upset and felt verbally abused. Then I remembered your words and realized it wasn&rsquo;t worth it. I contacted my former boss at the big company (who said, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say you were going on leave?&rdquo;), and he welcomed me back. I quickly resigned and returned to my old company. Although I&rsquo;m not a &ldquo;big shot,&rdquo; I feel it was the right decision. That one month at the small company was miserable; there was no happiness. It seems more money can&rsquo;t buy happiness.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Brian, you did the absolutely right thing! Cutting your losses in time and leaving an unsuitable environment is crucial. Just as we shouldn&rsquo;t buy or sell based on stock price fluctuations, we shouldn&rsquo;t choose or leave a job solely based on salary. Happiness is priceless, &ldquo;worth a thousand pieces of gold,&rdquo; and far more important than a high salary. When considering a job, the first question to ask is &ldquo;Am I happy?&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re not, you should leave. Happiness is a human right. You shouldn&rsquo;t accept anything that makes you unhappy. First, remove external sources of unhappiness, then cultivate inner happiness. Young people should try to work for large companies. They have more resources, better systems, and you can learn more (learn systems, management, learn in a big ocean), and the career paths are broader. If you encounter a bad manager or department in a large company, consider an internal transfer (the manager might be transferred, but a good company will remain), rather than resigning hastily. I myself proactively sought an opportunity to be transferred from Acer Taiwan to the US.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: I am an old student who started following you during the market low in 2002, and you gave me a lot of confidence back then. Recently, there&rsquo;s a trend in our group to share that if you use a large amount of cash from your pledged loan, you should prepare twice the borrowed amount in cash as a buffer. To meet this requirement, I sold some of my QLD to supplement my cash, which brought my Beta down very low. Now, I have a new sum of money coming in. Should I use it to pay back part of the loan, or to buy back the QLD I sold? Cheng Feng&rsquo;s advice was that if you use a large sum of money, you need to adjust the entire portfolio proportionally, including the non-leveraged fund (QQQ). Does this conflict with your frequent advice to &ldquo;never sell the core fund&rdquo;? Also, I think Kate said that new funds coming in shouldn&rsquo;t be used to return to a fixed ratio allocation? I&rsquo;m very confused and feel like I haven&rsquo;t grasped the core idea after following you for so long.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Cheng Feng&rsquo;s understanding is correct. When you &ldquo;borrow and spend&rdquo; a large amount of cash from your pledged account (e.g., 10% or more of your total assets, like borrowing 1 million from a 10 million total asset base), this is a special situation that requires a &ldquo;re-navigation&rdquo; or &ldquo;re-positioning&rdquo; of your entire asset allocation.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example and Adjustment Steps</strong>: Let&rsquo;s say you originally had 10 million in assets with a 433 allocation: 4 million in QQQ, 3 million in QLD, and 3 million in cash. Now, you need to borrow and spend 1 million for an emergency.
<ol>
<li>For this 1 million loan, you need to set aside an additional 2 million in cash as a risk buffer (because you borrowed 1 million, you prepare 2 million in cash).</li>
<li>So, out of your 10 million total assets, 2 million in cash is specifically designated to cover this loan risk. The remaining 8 million (10 million - 2 million) is then allocated according to your target allocation (e.g., 433, or adjusted to a more conservative Beta of 0.8, which corresponds to a certain proportion). Specifically, a 433 allocation for 8 million would be: 3.2M QQQ, 2.4M QLD, 2.4M operational cash. Add the 2M risk buffer, and your total cash is 4.4M. In this case, the leveraged fund is 2.4M, which is 24% of the 10M total assets, contributing a Beta of 0.48; the non-leveraged fund is 3.2M, contributing a Beta of 0.32. The total Beta is 0.8.</li>
<li>In this situation, selling a portion of your existing QQQ and QLD proportionally and combining it with your existing cash to create the 2 million risk buffer and the cash needed for the new allocation is a reasonable &ldquo;asset structure adjustment.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not considered a &ldquo;sale that violates the never-sell principle.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>New Capital Injection</strong>: When you have new funds coming in (like the new capital you mentioned), you can use them to restore your QLD position or to supplement the relevant parts of your &ldquo;re-navigated&rdquo; target allocation (which might be Beta 0.8). Restoring QLD to bring the Beta back to 0.8 is fine; it doesn&rsquo;t have to go back to 1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Kate&rsquo;s Viewpoint</strong>: What Kate said about &ldquo;new funds not being used to return to a fixed ratio&rdquo; usually refers to routine, small-scale additions of capital. In that case, you don&rsquo;t need to strictly follow the initial 433 ratio; you can flexibly add to the part you feel needs strengthening the most (e.g., add to cash if it&rsquo;s low, or add to the leveraged position if you want to increase it). This is a different scenario from the &ldquo;re-allocation&rdquo; after a &ldquo;large withdrawal and spending&rdquo; that you described. When a plane is on autopilot, small adjustments are fine. But if the number of passengers changes significantly or the destination changes, you need to re-plan the route and fuel.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Under normal autopilot (small fund inflows/outflows or rebalancing due to market fluctuations), the core asset is not easily touched. But when a major event like a large withdrawal for spending occurs, changing the overall risk structure, you need to re-evaluate and adjust the entire allocation. Following for a long time doesn&rsquo;t guarantee you&rsquo;ve learned well; the key is to learn the core principles.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: I want to share some risk points about the direct selling (or MLM) industry, as I heard a user mention wanting to return to Taiwan to do direct selling to change their situation.
<ol>
<li><strong>High entry fees</strong>: Be wary of these.</li>
<li><strong>No substantial product or service</strong>: Or the price of the product/service is severely disconnected from its market value (e.g., selling wine from Maotai Town at an exorbitant price; something worth a few hundred sold for thousands).</li>
<li><strong>Focus on recruiting downlines, ignoring consumer experience</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Different purchase prices for agents at different levels</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Promises of quick riches through IPOs, dividends, or stock options</strong>: Especially with newly established companies that lure you into buying a lot of inventory at once.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Advice for Choosing Direct Selling</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Mainland China</strong>: Look for companies with a direct selling license issued by the Ministry of Commerce (a total of 88), which are relatively legitimate. There are now many new retail, social e-commerce, and micro-business models whose underlying logic may be similar.</li>
<li><strong>US or other regions</strong>: Choose companies that have been established for over 10 years, preferably publicly listed ones (financial reports are public and transparent, and can be analyzed). Only about 10% of new companies survive for three to five years; most fail within five years.</li>
<li><strong>Long-termism</strong>: Even with legitimate direct selling, it requires long-term commitment (at least 5 years). Don&rsquo;t expect to get rich quick. If it feels like a &ldquo;great opportunity&rdquo; for rapid change, there&rsquo;s a high risk of being scammed.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of &ldquo;Direct Selling + Insurance&rdquo; models</strong>: In the US, services can also be sold via direct selling. The combination of direct selling and insurance requires special caution, as it can be highly deceptive, seeming to offer both income and security. Chinese direct selling law requires physical products and a factory.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: JASON&rsquo;s reminder is excellent; scams are everywhere. Everyone should be wary of messages that demand urgent action (e.g., &ldquo;Your payment of $698 has been successful, please call this number if you have questions&rdquo;), or else your account will be frozen, your package will be lost, or that urge you to pay first. You can use AI tools like ChatGPT to make a preliminary judgment on the authenticity of an email (I once used ChatGPT to verify a DMV email). Remember, nothing is that urgent. Take a deep breath, think calmly, and don&rsquo;t part with your money easily. When people are eager to do something (like get rich), they are more likely to be scammed. I myself had an experience in high school with a summer job scam that cost me 300 TWD; I paid the fee and the person disappeared.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The market is truly unrelated to international situations, financial reports, or the economy. Whether interest rates are cut or not doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s all fine, it has nothing to do with us. It all has nothing to do with me.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This viewpoint, woven throughout the session, emphasizes the transcendent mindset an investor should have, focusing on their own investment discipline and not being distracted by external noise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The market will definitely go up, the market will definitely reach new highs. Investing requires patience, and wealth is worth the trouble.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This articulates a firm belief in the long-term trend of the market and the character required for successful investing—patience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I might be wrong. I might be wrong. I might be wrong.
&ndash; Teacher James (quoting from the book &ldquo;I Might Be Wrong&rdquo;)</p></blockquote>
<p>When facing disagreements or strong emotions, engaging in self-reflection first can help resolve conflicts and enhance cognition and inner peace.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hold stocks in your hand, but not their prices in your heart. You only need to spend five minutes a year on it.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This describes the ideal state of investing: holding quality assets without being disturbed by short-term price fluctuations, emphasizing the simplicity and passive nature of investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boredom is the highest state of investing. If you feel it&rsquo;s exciting, then you&rsquo;re speculating, you&rsquo;re gambling.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This reveals the true nature of long-term value investing, drawing a clear line between it and the thrill-seeking behavior of speculation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can handle something, face it and get it done. If you can&rsquo;t handle it, then forget about it, as it&rsquo;s not within your capability.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This offers a philosophical attitude for dealing with various problems in life and investing, reducing unnecessary worries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely do not sell your QQQ, sell your 00662, during a downturn. You can choose not to buy, but you must never sell.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>This emphasizes that one should not panic-sell core quality assets during a market correction, a common mistake among investors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t leave (your current job) because your salary is low, and don&rsquo;t jump to another just because its salary is high.
&ndash; Teacher James (commenting on Brian&rsquo;s sharing)</p></blockquote>
<p>This highlights that in career choices, personal happiness and the growth environment are more important than short-term salary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your cash must be able to last you 15 years (during a market downturn). This is a critical key.
&ndash; Teacher James (on asset allocation for retirees)</p></blockquote>
<p>This points out the importance of having cash reserves in retirement planning that can cover a long bear market (which could last up to 15 years before the market doubles).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happiness is a human right. Therefore, you shouldn&rsquo;t accept anything that makes you unhappy.
&ndash; Teacher James (commenting on Brian&rsquo;s sharing)</p></blockquote>
<p>This encourages people to prioritize inner happiness and harmony in their work and life, and to have the courage to change unhappy situations.</p>

<p>In this sharing session, Teacher James once again reinforced the core philosophy of long-term investing: maintain optimism, adhere to discipline, and filter out market noise with the wisdom of &ldquo;it has nothing to do with me.&rdquo; By recommending &ldquo;I Might Be Wrong&rdquo; and &ldquo;Life is Worthwhile,&rdquo; he guided students to cultivate their inner selves, focus on breathing and relaxation, and achieve harmony in both investing and life. In terms of asset allocation, the teacher detailed cash management strategies for different life stages, especially the importance of having 15 years of living expenses for retirees to safely navigate market cycles, and gave clear guidance on pledging, leverage, and Beta control. The Q&amp;A session delved into specific cases, addressing students&rsquo; confusion in practical operations, such as portfolio adjustments after large cash withdrawals, tax considerations for overseas investments, the wisdom of career choices, and preventing financial scams like direct selling. The teacher encouraged students to work and live in a relaxed, stress-free state, to simplify investing, and ultimately achieve financial freedom and life happiness. He emphasized investing in index funds like QQQ/00662 and avoiding annuities and unnecessary insurance.</p>

<p>The core of this lecture is to emphasize <strong>persisting in long-term investment in the Nasdaq 100 index fund, prioritizing risk control and reasonable asset allocation, and maintaining an extremely optimistic investment mindset</strong>. Teacher James points out that market volatility is normal; investors should ignore short-term fluctuations, focus on long-term growth, recognize the critical role of cash in asset allocation, and ultimately achieve financial freedom and life&rsquo;s purpose.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Market&rsquo;s Normal State</strong>: Global situations and market turmoil are normal. Investors should remain calm and not be disturbed by short-term volatility, international affairs, market analysis, financial statements, or economic conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This channel is a pro bono sharing platform and does not constitute investment advice. There are no fees, no alternate accounts, and be wary of scams. Investing involves risk, which you must manage yourself. Relevant links are pinned in the YouTube comments section.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Path</strong>: Newcomers are advised to start with &ldquo;00451 The One-Dollar Investment Lecture,&rdquo; think independently, and find a method that suits them. Quiet study improves the quality of thought more than joining too many groups.</li>
<li><strong>Core Investment Vehicle</strong>: Focus on the Nasdaq 100 index fund (like QQQ). Page 10 of the handout provides a selection of related funds worldwide. The videos started in 2018, and there is a complete 2022 course playlist available.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Mentality</strong>: Always be extremely optimistic, always face the sun; the market will eventually go up. Investing requires patience (ignoring market fluctuations), and financial freedom is worth the wait. Please like, comment, and subscribe on all platforms.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stablecoins and Short-Term Treasuries</strong>: A student asked if the issuance of stablecoins would increase demand for short-term treasuries and lower their interest rates. Teacher James believes short-term treasury rates are tied to the central bank&rsquo;s rates and won&rsquo;t fall significantly because of this. Short-term treasuries are similar to money market funds with low volatility. The central bank&rsquo;s rate is the benchmark; no one would buy a bond with a lower rate.</li>
<li><strong>The Trap of Long-Term Bonds</strong>: Long-term bond interest is linked to inflation expectations for many years to come, and the interest is fixed.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: For a 30-year Treasury bond with a 5% coupon rate, if inflation is 3%, the real annualized rate of return (Real IRR) is only 1.94%. In contrast, if short-term rates are 4%, it is far superior to the real return of long-term bonds. The $5 in interest you receive after 30 years will have long been devalued.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: It is not recommended for individual investors to buy long-term government bonds. Issuing long-term bonds is advantageous for the U.S. Treasury because the long-term interest is close to zero for the issuer (after considering inflation). Even if the central bank&rsquo;s rate is below 2%, buying long-term bonds is not necessarily a good deal. The Treasury has its own issuance plan and won&rsquo;t easily change it due to shifts in the central bank&rsquo;s rates. The idea of issuing 100-year bonds is impractical and tantamount to default.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Awareness</strong>: The first priority in investing is risk control; the world is full of uncertainties (like the conflict in Israel).</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Asset Allocation</strong>: Good asset allocation is a &ldquo;master strategy&rdquo; (奇门遁甲), a powerful &ldquo;Army, Navy, and Air Force&rdquo; deployment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash</strong>: The &ldquo;food and air&rdquo; of asset allocation, the most important part. Sufficient cash prevents market panic.</li>
<li><strong>Index Fund</strong>: The &ldquo;aircraft carrier&rdquo; of asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraged Fund</strong>: Like the &ldquo;missile force.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging</strong>: The &ldquo;Transformer&rdquo; of asset allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Courage to Sell a House for Investment</strong>: Selling your primary residence to rent and investing the funds in an index is an excellent financial strategy, but it requires a strong mind and the courage to face social judgment (e.g., fear of being told you&rsquo;re &ldquo;not doing well&rdquo;). In reality, this is a sign of &ldquo;doing exceptionally well.&rdquo;</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Difficulty of Educating Family and Friends</strong>: Family and friends would rather trust the annuities and savings insurance (1% return) recommended by bank advisors than accept advice about index funds (10% long-term return), even when presented with spreadsheets. The main reason is the fear of &ldquo;what if it drops?&rdquo;
<ul>
<li><strong>Counter-strategy</strong>: First, become a &ldquo;big tree&rdquo; yourself and influence them with your own success. Your words carry little weight when you&rsquo;re insignificant; &ldquo;familiarity breeds contempt&rdquo; (近庙欺神). It&rsquo;s hard to distinguish &ldquo;saints&rdquo; from &ldquo;demons&rdquo; in society.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive Roots of the Wealth Gap</strong>: Poverty is often caused by a lack of awareness, not systemic issues. CLEC aims to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; this &ldquo;disease of poverty,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s very difficult; even family members may not accept it. Some people can&rsquo;t accept good medicine and instead buy things like long-term bonds.</li>
<li><strong>The Challenges of Individual Stock Investing</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: NVIDIA&rsquo;s stock price fluctuates wildly. It was once sold off due to poor sales and excess inventory, then soared because of AI. It&rsquo;s difficult for individual investors to grasp; even if you bought it, you might not have held on for the entire ride.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Individual stocks are volatile, information is asymmetric, and they can suddenly be cut in half or go to zero. ETFs provide a more stable way to share in market growth. It&rsquo;s also very hard to stick with a portfolio of mixed-quality individual stocks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Dangers of Short-Term Trading</strong>: Short-term trading is like &ldquo;gambling + drug addiction.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s addictive and leads not only to financial loss but also the loss of family, health, and self, potentially ruining one&rsquo;s entire life. There&rsquo;s no need to become a &ldquo;boy wonder trader.&rdquo;</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profit Motives of Banks and Insurance Companies</strong>: Criticizes post offices and banks for persuading depositors (especially the elderly) to buy annuity insurance, structured notes, and similar products. This is a failure of financial regulators.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Issues</strong>: Believes financial regulators should ensure the separation of savings, insurance, wealth management, and lending to avoid conflicts of interest. American commercial banks (like BofA) don&rsquo;t proactively sell insurance. Taiwan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Financial Holding Company&rdquo; model is described as an &ldquo;all-encompassing, one-stop-shop scam.&rdquo; Charles Schwab only mentions loan options when a client has a large funding need.</li>
<li><strong>The Goal of the Insurance Industry</strong>: To convert large amounts of fixed deposits into insurance policies, which is the main objective of the insurance industry, given the huge amount of fixed deposits in Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>The Risk of Mortgaging Property to Buy Insurance</strong>: There have been cases where the property mortgage remains, but the insurance policy&rsquo;s value drops to zero, leaving people homeless. These institutions &ldquo;will go as far as making people homeless.&rdquo;</li>

<h3 class="relative group">Responses to Chat Comments and Additional Remarks (Teacher James&rsquo;s collective response to student comments and personal reflections)

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>On Publishing a Book/Media Exposure</strong>: Teacher James frankly states that if he were to publicly promote his ideas like &ldquo;investing with loans&rdquo; and &ldquo;not buying a house,&rdquo; he could violate financial regulations (practicing without a license), offend powerful interest groups (real estate, insurance, finance), and even face cyberbullying and political pressure (being labeled &ldquo;pro-Taiwan independence&rdquo; or &ldquo;pro-CCP&rdquo;). He could be &ldquo;torn to shreds&rdquo; or even &ldquo;end up in jail.&rdquo; If he doesn&rsquo;t discuss many of these topics, the teaching loses its meaning. The very people you help might turn around and curse you.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance</strong>: An insurance policy with a 1.06% annual return is acceptable if it includes protection, but it&rsquo;s generally not recommended.</li>
<li><strong>Caring for Parents</strong>: Re-emphasizes the loneliness and health risks of elderly people living alone (not taking medicine on time, not measuring blood sugar/pressure, leading to complications like worsening COPD, minor strokes, brain atrophy, mental disorders). Advises children to pay attention and provide companionship early. Even if parents seem self-sufficient, consider arranging for a caregiver early to prevent accidents and ensure a regular routine (medication, diet, avoiding falls). Shares his regret of not returning to Taiwan in time to accompany his mother, who, despite having other children in Taiwan, was not adequately cared for while living alone. Emphasizes that parents&rsquo; health is the children&rsquo;s happiness.</li>
<li><strong>A Partner&rsquo;s Investment Philosophy</strong>: Accept individual differences. Due to different upbringings and personal experiences (like living through the dot-com and 2008 bubbles), security levels and cognitions vary. Lead by example and influence them gradually with long-term results; don&rsquo;t force it. It&rsquo;s normal for them not to listen to you, just as you may not listen to them.</li>
<li><strong>00662 (Taiwan ETF) Currency Impact</strong>: Short-term currency fluctuations are normal. For instance, when the Taiwan dollar depreciated in the previous two years, 00662 outperformed QQQ. In the long run, currency effects tend to cancel each other out.</li>
<li><strong>Credit Loans vs. Stock Pledges</strong>: Credit loans are relatively independent and safe. Stock pledges are high-risk; a sharp market downturn could trigger a margin call, making it like a &ldquo;loan shark&rdquo; — you have to pay back when they demand it, or you&rsquo;re &ldquo;shot dead with one bullet.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Brokerage Firms Raising Pledge Rates and Risks</strong>: Brokerages like Capital Securities in Taiwan might raise interest rates after a client has borrowed, or even restrict withdrawals (due to limited funding pools), &ldquo;luring you into a trap.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s advisable to prioritize more stable brokerages like Yuanta Securities.</li>
<li><strong>Apply for Credit Loans Early</strong>: Bank credit policies can change. When you qualify (e.g., with an interest rate below 2%), you should apply early. Seize the opportunity when a bank proactively offers you a loan.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging in Hong Kong</strong>: HSBC is a good choice, especially for VIP clients with large capital (e.g., over 1 million HKD). HSBC&rsquo;s pledge interest rates are currently low. Friends from Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, etc., who successfully open an account and get a pledge loan from HSBC are welcome to share their experiences.</li>
<li><strong>QQQ Compounding</strong>: The annualized rate of return (CAGR), according to Teacher James&rsquo;s research, is around 18% (including dividend reinvestment).</li>
<li><strong>Repayment of Investment Mortgage</strong>: Typically, it&rsquo;s a lump-sum repayment at maturity (10-15 years). By then, you can sell some stocks or use another pledged loan to repay it. You need more than 15 years to ensure profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Compound Frequency</strong>: Refers to capital gains and dividend reinvestment.</li>
<li><strong>Philosophy of Helping Others</strong>: There are different levels of helping others. The lowest is for others (hoping for their well-being). The next is for oneself (deriving happiness or meaning from it). The highest is selflessness (helping is a natural act, regardless of for whom, or whether it brings happiness, like the Buddha or Jesus; it&rsquo;s natural ethics). Using helping others to add meaning and happiness to one&rsquo;s own life is actually &ldquo;not right.&rdquo; The highest state is &ldquo;like water flowing without a trace&rdquo; (传过水无痕).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: An elderly friend, who was once very influential in the market, agrees with Teacher James&rsquo;s index investing philosophy. This elder confessed that his past outsized returns were due to information asymmetry and his influence (manipulating small-cap stocks), which is not replicable for ordinary investors. He believes it&rsquo;s not easy for ordinary people to make money in the market, and index investing is the most correct path.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Index investing not only makes you money but also gives you a &ldquo;life&rdquo; (improves quality of life). Even if you make money from short-term trading, you might lose your life due to constant anxiety (e.g., being unable to take a 15-day vacation with peace of mind).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sharing (Follow-up)</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Reflecting on her family life, she emphasizes love and companionship for her parents to avoid regrets. She sees Teacher James&rsquo;s actions as &ldquo;dedication&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;charity&rdquo; with a sense of superiority and feels for the misunderstandings he might face.</li>
<li>Shares her future plans: to establish a women&rsquo;s financial academy (focusing on female financial awareness, as Chinese women are relatively disadvantaged, and financial independence provides more confidence), volunteer in hospice care (to learn about &ldquo;fasting until death&rdquo; and euthanasia), travel, read, and set up scholarships, reflecting a desire for &ldquo;altruism&rdquo; (influenced by Kazuo Inamori&rsquo;s philosophy of &ldquo;altruism&rdquo;).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Commends Kacy&rsquo;s practice of accompanying her parents. Shares the joy of his own father, in his 90s, still planning a trip to Korea. Advises that for elderly parents, even if they appear healthy, one should consider arranging for a caregiver early to prevent accidents and ensure a regular routine (medication, diet). Parents&rsquo; health is the children&rsquo;s happiness. If parents have medical needs, like follow-up visits every three months or low-dose lung cancer screenings, they should be supported.</li>
<li>Greatly admires Kacy&rsquo;s &ldquo;altruistic&rdquo; plans, believing that from a women&rsquo;s financial academy to educating disadvantaged groups, it&rsquo;s all very meaningful. It&rsquo;s right to start planning now.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: His mother noticed his mood has become calmer and happier recently. He explained it&rsquo;s because through investing (practicing the teacher&rsquo;s teachings), he has found meaning in life and is confident about his future wealth, no longer worrying about finances. This has led to an internal change from external influences.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Shares his own longing and regrets regarding his mother, how in his youth he failed to fully grasp the loneliness and hardship of an elderly person living alone (e.g., his mother falling while going to the doctor alone, and his own failure to return to Taiwan to be with her). Reminds everyone to care for their parents, especially those living alone, after achieving financial freedom early, to avoid life&rsquo;s regrets. Advises young people to learn from wise elders (like Warren Buffett) to avoid many pitfalls and find a &ldquo;mental coach.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Following the teacher&rsquo;s guidance, he used an investment mortgage to invest in 00662. After using a portion of the funds from high-dividend ETFs to pay the monthly interest, there&rsquo;s still a surplus each month. Should he invest this in 00865 (short-term bond/cash-like ETF) or continue buying fractional shares of 00662?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: Continue buying 00662. The emergency fund (00865) only needs to be built up to a certain level (e.g., 2-3 years of living expenses for someone employed). Any excess funds should be invested in growth assets.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing 1</strong>: Recalls entering the market in 2018, with emotions fluctuating with the market, having once lost 50%. A wise friend enlightened her (&ldquo;Save money when you&rsquo;re making it, and just wait it out when it&rsquo;s down&rdquo;), teaching her to remain calm through ups and downs and become numb to the market. Mentions how wealthy people view money (a piece of clothing costs 500-600k; money is like trash to them). Grateful for the teacher&rsquo;s guidance that has &ldquo;filled her head.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Sharing 2</strong>: Has come to understand the teacher&rsquo;s mindset that &ldquo;all sharing is for self-fulfillment, not for rewards.&rdquo; When sharing investment ideas with others, she encounters different reactions: some (who have worked for 20-30 years and are set in their ways) cling to old concepts, while others, despite living in hardship (a single mother working two jobs), are willing to listen. Through sharing, she has also gained a sense of value by giving back the knowledge she has learned.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: (Regarding Sharing 2) Helping others can bring happiness, but the highest state is to be &ldquo;unaffected by helping,&rdquo; meaning helping others is a natural act, not for happiness, not for self. The lowest level is &ldquo;for others,&rdquo; i.e., for their benefit; the second level is &ldquo;for oneself,&rdquo; i.e., achieving self-actualization through helping (the teacher admits his own teaching is to find value in retirement); the highest is &ldquo;selflessness,&rdquo; where even the thought of &ldquo;for myself&rdquo; is gone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: After sharing investment concepts with friends, how can she determine if they truly understand? Are there any questions to ask to test them? (Friends listen and think it&rsquo;s logical but can&rsquo;t articulate it themselves.)
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: It&rsquo;s hard to judge with simple questions. True understanding is reflected in action (like opening an account to invest). A more effective way is like how Frank guided him back in the day (meeting for dinner every week, hand-holding him through opening an account, starting with a $200 Mutual Fund), guiding them step-by-step to open an account, make their first investment, and follow up continuously. This is a process of &ldquo;sowing seeds&rdquo;; whether and when they sprout is unknown. He himself was &ldquo;led by the hand&rdquo; by Frank to get started. Now, he is willing to be such a guide, with the Bodhisattva spirit of &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t descend into hell, who will?&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Gained insights from gardening.
<ol>
<li><strong>Individual Differences</strong>: The same seeds planted result in different flowers, just as people receive information differently. Their internal &ldquo;genes&rdquo; determine their level of acceptance and reaction (some &ldquo;get it,&rdquo; others &ldquo;laugh it off&rdquo;). The gardener (the sharer) cannot change the seed&rsquo;s nature.</li>
<li><strong>Patient Guidance</strong>: A good gardener will loosen the soil and water, helping it grow, just as a mentor guides students to open accounts and invest.</li>
<li><strong>Inner Joy</strong>: The pleasure derived from tilling the soil and weeding surpasses the rewards of all fame and fortune. This effort is not for a return but for self-actualization.</li>
<li><strong>Practical Example</strong>: She once guided a friend to buy QQQ. The friend sold during a dip and missed the subsequent 45% gain. She only sent a screenshot and said no more, believing it was also &ldquo;fate.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Translating for the Elderly at a Doctor&rsquo;s Visit</strong>: Shares her experience as a volunteer translator for the elderly, realizing their immense need in medical communication. Such small acts can bring great help and a ray of light into their lives.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment</strong>: Agrees with the views on &ldquo;destiny&rdquo; and intrinsic motivation. Shares his own experience of planting tomatoes, where three seeds grew very differently; one was a &ldquo;chosen seedling&rdquo; and very robust, while others were &ldquo;sickly.&rdquo; Cites Dr. Yang Ding-I&rsquo;s view to &ldquo;look inward.&rdquo; For people you can&rsquo;t change, don&rsquo;t force it. Be yourself, don&rsquo;t be discouraged by it; giving up is an option. Affirms the value of her volunteer work.</li>

<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Came into contact with CLEC in 2024 through a friend (who had mentioned it 5 years ago, but she was indifferent at the time). In her 50s, she has been interested in investing since graduating from college and has been exploring on her own for years. She was deeply moved after listening to the lectures and has invested a lot of time in studying (finished the 2021-2022 courses and is now re-listening). She shared it with a hundred people, and only two took action, but she still feels gratified.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Regarding the choice between a credit loan and a stock pledge in Taiwan. She leans towards using the stock pledge first (2.56% interest, no principal repayment, only interest), because of its convenience. She thinks she can use a credit loan (already approved for a 3 million TWD limit, but requires installment repayments) as a backup if the stock market crashes. She believes her job is stable (banks are always begging her to take out loans), so she&rsquo;s not afraid of unemployment and can access the credit loan anytime.
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Response</strong>: (In a firm tone, repeatedly emphasizing) <strong>Absolutely do not do this!</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Core Principle</strong>: Money borrowed from a stock pledge <strong>must not be reinvested in the stock market</strong>. It can only be used for living expenses or to repay other loans. This is &ldquo;the first thing.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Huge Risk</strong>: When the market crashes, banks may tighten credit (&ldquo;take away the umbrella in the rain&rdquo;), and you might not be able to borrow money then. If you lose your job at the same time, it&rsquo;s even more impossible. A credit loan is not something you can just &ldquo;hold there&rdquo; forever.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy All Troops (韩信点兵)</strong>: All available &ldquo;forces&rdquo; (including the credit loan) should be deployed to the &ldquo;battlefield&rdquo; (investment) as early as possible.</li>
<li><strong>The Correct Approach</strong>: You should first take out the credit loan (e.g., 3 million TWD) and invest it in the market. The monthly loan repayments can be paid using funds from a low-interest stock pledge. This way, the principal continues to work in the market, and your personal salary can also be invested. Don&rsquo;t take a huge risk just because you&rsquo;re &ldquo;too lazy to repay the principal&rdquo; or tempted by the short-term convenience of a pledge.</li>
<li><strong>Safety of Credit Loans</strong>: A credit loan is a relatively safe form of leverage, not directly linked to market fluctuations, and you won&rsquo;t get a margin call. With a stock pledge, even if you only borrow 10% (e.g., pledging 1 million from a 10 million asset portfolio—the teacher thinks 10% is already a huge risk, let alone the 2-3 million she wants to borrow), you could face risks in an extreme market downturn.</li>
<li><strong>Brokerage Risk</strong>: Some brokerages in Taiwan (like Capital Securities) may change their pledge interest rates, and their limited funding pools might prevent you from withdrawing funds as needed.
(Kacy and other students also chimed in, emphasizing the risk of banks &ldquo;taking away the umbrella in the rain&rdquo; and the fundamental difference between credit loans and pledges, and that pledged money cannot be used to buy more stocks).</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Market fluctuations have nothing to do with me, international affairs have nothing to do with me, market analysis has nothing to do with me, financial statements have nothing to do with us, and the economic situation doesn&rsquo;t matter at all. Don&rsquo;t pay attention to it. The more you pay attention, the more mistakes you&rsquo;ll make.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Teacher James emphasized at the beginning the composure investors should have, not letting external noise affect their investment decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investing requires patience, and financial freedom is worth the wait. What is patience? It is to be unconcerned with market fluctuations.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Explaining that the core of long-term investing lies in the psychological tolerance for market volatility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cash is the food and air of asset allocation.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Emphasizing the extreme importance of holding sufficient cash for risk management and psychological stability in asset allocation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are poor because of a lack of awareness, not because the system made you poor.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When discussing the difficulty of teaching family about investing, pointing out that the wealth gap often stems from cognitive differences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Short-term trading doesn&rsquo;t just want your money; it will want your life and your lifelong happiness.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>In investing, we first seek safety, then profit. First, seek safety; do what is foolproof first.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Emphasizing that the primary principle of investing is safety, in response to a student&rsquo;s question about credit loans versus stock pledges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are making money, you should also be humble and look at everything with humility. Just as Teacher James taught me, whether the market goes up or down, OK, be numb to it. It doesn&rsquo;t have a big impact on our daily lives.
&ndash; IM</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student IM sharing her transformation from anxiously watching the market to maintaining a calm composure towards market fluctuations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The things we invest in others, when we invest, it&rsquo;s not for a return. It&rsquo;s because you have to do this thing. You have to do what is meaningful to you; this is the value of your being.
&ndash; Man</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Man drawing an analogy from gardening to the intrinsic value of sharing knowledge and helping others, without seeking external rewards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life is really not just about money&hellip; Wealth is about having enough.
&ndash; Kacy</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: Student Kacy sharing her pursuit of quality of life, believing that more wealth is not necessarily better; having enough is sufficient.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The highest level is helping others without any sense of happiness, without feeling&hellip; Even the &lsquo;for myself&rsquo; is gone. This is what I have learned, that even the &lsquo;for myself&rsquo; is gone.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Background: When responding to IM&rsquo;s question about the motivation for sharing, he explains the three levels of helping behavior, the highest of which is selfless altruism, a natural act.</p>

<p>In this session, Teacher James systematically re-emphasized his core investment philosophy: consistently buy and hold the Nasdaq 100 index fund, fearless of short-term market volatility. He focused on analyzing the extreme importance of risk control, viewing reasonable asset allocation (especially an adequate cash reserve) as the cornerstone of investment success. Through specific examples, the teacher revealed the investment value trap of long-term bonds and severely criticized certain misleading and detrimental practices in the financial industry, especially warning investors against low-return products like annuities and savings insurance. At the same time, he pointed out the huge uncertainty of individual stock investing and the destructive nature of short-term trading. During the Q&amp;A session, students actively shared their insights and confusions from their investment practices, family communication, and personal growth. Teacher James not only provided specific investment advice (such as the correct use and risk perception of credit loans versus stock pledges) but also guided students from a life philosophy perspective to reflect on the meaning of wealth, work, family, and personal value, encouraging everyone on the path to financial freedom to continuously enhance their cognition, maintain a positive mindset, pay attention to family and social responsibilities, and ultimately give back to society.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Solid Returns with Beta 0.5</strong>: Even with just 50% in QQQ (Beta 0.5) and 50% in cash (e.g., a money market fund with a hypothetical 4% return), the long-term annualized return can be substantial (e.g., 0.5 * 4% + 0.5 * 14% = 9%).</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation for Retirees</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Retirees with sufficient funds should prioritize stability over maximum returns.</li>
<li>Suggested allocations: 70% QQQ + 30% cash; 60% QQQ + 40% cash; or 50% QQQ + 50% cash.</li>
<li>Keep at least 30% in cash as a stabilizing force.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rebalancing Considerations</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If you have sufficient cash flow and reserves, there&rsquo;s no need to actively rebalance. Let QQQ grow through compounding.</li>
<li>If reserves are insufficient, sell a portion of QQQ when it has significant gains to increase your cash reserves.</li>
<li>Retirees can set aside 15 years of living expenses in cash and invest the rest in QQQ. When the cash is used up, withdraw half of the QQQ holdings into cash, and repeat the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation for Young People</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Set aside a 1-2 year emergency fund and prepare for children&rsquo;s tuition.</li>
<li>The remaining funds can be fully invested in QQQ.</li>
<li>Start conservatively when first entering the market and gradually increase your risk tolerance.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Life is hard enough without feelings; feelings make life even harder&rdquo;</strong>: Replace &ldquo;feelings&rdquo; (情) with &ldquo;human nature&rdquo; (人性), and the saying becomes: &ldquo;Human nature makes the stock market even harder.&rdquo; To succeed in investing, you must train yourself to overcome the emotional weaknesses of human nature, achieving a state of &ldquo;indifference to the market and money,&rdquo; feeling nothing about gains or losses.</li>
<li><strong>Separation of Tasks</strong>: Distinguish between your own tasks and others&rsquo; tasks. For example, a child&rsquo;s education is the parents&rsquo; task and should not be overly interfered with by grandparents.</li>
<li><strong>Live in the Present, No Regrets</strong>: &ldquo;Looking back on life, there is neither wind, nor rain, nor clear skies.&rdquo; What matters is the present moment; have no regrets.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correct Mistakes Promptly</strong>: If an initial investment strategy was wrong and led to losses, change it immediately rather than waiting to break even. The latter is a gambler&rsquo;s mentality.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Direction</strong>: Effort is meaningful only when the direction is correct. The right direction is proper asset allocation, index investing, and maintaining sufficient cash.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Awareness and Control</strong>: First, understand the risks (e.g., the market could drop 85% and stay there for 10 years). Then, control the risk through asset allocation (cash is a critical line of defense, like the air force and supplies in a battle).</li>
<li><strong>Buying Strategy</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The best option is to buy immediately when you have the money.</li>
<li>If buying in installments, do so at predetermined times and at the market price, regardless of market ups and downs.</li>
<li>&ldquo;He who buys is an apprentice; he who holds on for dear life is the master.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Wisdom of Borrowing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Money is only yours when it&rsquo;s in your pocket.&rdquo;</li>
<li>In low-interest-rate regions (like Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China), borrow money to invest. Use leverage to let &ldquo;other people&rsquo;s chickens lay eggs for you&rdquo; (generate returns with borrowed money) while your own &ldquo;chickens&rdquo; (assets) continue to grow.</li>
<li>Social security benefits and the like should be claimed as early as possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Individualized Advice</strong>: Teacher James emphasizes that his investment advice is a &ldquo;unique&rdquo; prescription for each person, tailored to their individual circumstances. There is no one-size-fits-all &ldquo;standard answer.&rdquo; For example, buying immediately at market price is ideal but not suitable for those with low psychological tolerance. A Beta of 1.0 or a 442 strategy (40% cash, 40% index, 20% leveraged index) offers high returns but also high risk. A Beta above 0.5 is enough to become wealthy.</li>

<li>Successfully applied for a &ldquo;home equity line of credit&rdquo; in Taiwan with a limit of over NT$10 million, an interest rate of about 2.4%, and an interest-only period of 2 years, extendable once to 4 years. After 4 years, it can be converted to an &ldquo;overdraft account,&rdquo; where you only pay interest (rate around 2.5%) and can use the principal indefinitely.</li>
<li>Plans to start investing next week according to the teacher&rsquo;s 4-3-3 allocation (40% cash, 30% QQQ, 30% leveraged QQQ. Michel&rsquo;s understanding might differ slightly from the teacher&rsquo;s later clarification, which defined 433 as 40% cash, 30% index, 30% leveraged index).</li>
<li>Although he missed the lower entry points, he has come to realize that looking back 20 years from now, today&rsquo;s prices will all seem sweet.</li>
<li>Thanks the teacher for expanding his cognition and giving him the courage to use financial weapons. The bank&rsquo;s review process was strict, so getting the loan means the bank also considers the risk manageable. His wife being an employee of a listed company might have helped. He used to think he should never be in debt, but his perspective has now changed.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: The fact that the bank dared to lend to you means they have assessed the risk. The low interest rates in Taiwan are a great opportunity. The current price of QQQ (e.g., $70-80) makes little difference in the long run (e.g., when it reaches $80,000 in the future). He encourages buying as soon as possible. Investing with borrowed money is a capitalist awakening, not a rebellious act.</li>

<li>Question: The teacher recently discussed technical analysis on other platforms to guide people towards long-term investing. Could he briefly explain the differences, pros, and cons of short-term technical analysis versus long-term investing for new students?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: He respects short-term traders and their philosophies. He used to trade that way himself with good results (but emphasizes it&rsquo;s not for everyone). He compares short-term trading to being a race car driver, with its specific scenarios and risks. Sharing his technical analysis experience is a way to offer them some help or an alternative perspective (long-term investing), not to change them. He is practicing how to communicate with people of different viewpoints, as if talking to his 25-year-old self. He himself does not trade short-term now and does not recommend it to his students. The technical analysis he refers to is very short-term (determining long/short based on a single candlestick). He admires the focus and effort of short-term traders.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: Explained investing to a 14-year-old from a poor family. He used analogies (Is today better than five years ago? Is this generation better off than our parents&rsquo;? Will the future be even better? Farmland evolving from growing bananas to oil palms to durians to solar panels, constantly seeking higher returns) to illustrate that QQQ automatically weeds out the weak and keeps the strong, just like how the &ldquo;fertile field&rdquo; of American high-tech is constantly being optimized. The boy&rsquo;s eyes filled with hope when he saw how 50 Malaysian Ringgit could become tens of millions through decades of compounding. IAM feels that 80-90% of people around him don&rsquo;t understand QQQ and will persist in sharing one-on-one.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: (Mentioned later when answering IAM&rsquo;s question) Being able to plant the seed of wealth for a young person is to save a person, a family. It is a wonderful thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 1: Regarding asset allocation (e.g., 442, 433, 631), after doing his own homework, he found that risk tolerance is closely related to one&rsquo;s personal life situation (work, consumption). He asks the teacher to confirm if asset allocation should be strictly by percentage, or if the proportion of leveraged funds should not exceed the cash or original capital.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Strategies like 433 (40% cash, 30% index fund, 30% leveraged fund) or 442 (40% cash, 40% index, 20% leveraged index) aim to raise the Beta to 1.0 using leverage while maintaining the safety of cash, thereby hoping not to lose out on market returns. This is the highest-risk allocation that passed simulations, like a plane pulling up just after scraping the ground—highly efficient. But it&rsquo;s not the only option; for example, 50% QQQ + 50% cash used as collateral also works. For retirees, it&rsquo;s recommended to keep Beta below 0.8, have at least 30% cash, and the leveraged fund portion should not exceed the cash or original capital—the lower the better, or even none at all. Beta should not be lower than 0.5.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: How exactly does QQQ&rsquo;s mechanism of &ldquo;weeding out the weak&rdquo; work? Is it based on market capitalization comparison or a standard like outperforming the SPY?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: QQQ selects the top 100 non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq, ranked by market capitalization. Market Cap = Stock Price × Shares Outstanding. If a company performs poorly, its stock price falls, and its market cap drops out of the top 100, it gets removed. This has nothing to do with whether the company is profitable (e.g., Amazon and Tesla were included in their early, unprofitable days due to their large market caps). The S&amp;P 500, on the other hand, has other criteria like profitability. QQQ selects the top 100, while SPY selects the top 500; a more elite group (QQQ) will generally have better average performance. The Dow Jones 30 is an even older index construction method.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: He is confused about stablecoins (fiat-backed, commodity-backed, crypto-backed). The original purpose of cryptocurrency was decentralization, but stablecoins seem centralized, even managed by governments. What is their purpose? Why not just invest in fiat currencies, commodities, or the US dollar directly? Can stablecoins appreciate in value? What is their real use? Is there an arbitrage opportunity like the one between TSMC&rsquo;s ADR (TSM) and its Taiwan stock (2330)?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ul>
<li><strong>TSMC Price Difference</strong>: It&rsquo;s normal for the same asset to have different prices in different markets (US ADR vs. local Taiwan stock), just as the same product has different prices in different stores, determined by market supply and demand.</li>
<li><strong>Core Value of Stablecoins</strong>: It mainly lies in <strong>transaction efficiency</strong>. Digital currency transfers are nearly instantaneous and global, whereas cross-border fiat transfers take days.</li>
<li><strong>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC)</strong>: Europe, China, and others are developing CBDCs to improve the circulation efficiency of their own currencies. China is also promoting CIPS to bypass SWIFT.</li>
<li><strong>US Shift in Attitude Towards Stablecoins</strong>: The US initially suppressed digital currencies (e.g., dealing with Binance&rsquo;s CZ, certain crypto-related banks). However, after the Trump administration, it realized that the dollar&rsquo;s status could be challenged by highly efficient digital currencies. It then shifted to embracing and regulating existing private stablecoin issuers (like Circle), bringing them under supervision through measures like the &ldquo;Genius Act&rdquo; (likely a colloquial term for a stablecoin regulation bill) to maintain the dollar&rsquo;s dominance in the digital sphere.</li>
<li><strong>Stablecoins Do Not Appreciate</strong>: Stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) are pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Their reserves consist of equivalent amounts of short-term US Treasury bills and cash. Issuers profit by earning interest on these reserves, while the stablecoins themselves do not pay interest to holders.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Stablecoins</strong>: They are primarily used for rapid payments and settlements, especially in international trade or business-to-business transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Monetary Expansion Effect</strong>: When banks hold Treasuries and issue an equivalent amount of stablecoins, it effectively increases the money supply (the Treasuries still exist, and now stablecoins are also in circulation). This is a positive for the stock market because it increases the liquidity of money and boosts economic efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Us as Investors</strong>: The accelerated flow of money will stimulate the economy, which is good for the stock market. Banks gain a new source of interest income from issuing stablecoins, so bank stocks may benefit.</li>
<li><strong>Regulation and KYC</strong>: To prevent money laundering, etc., the issuance and trading of stablecoins will be strictly regulated, requiring KYC (Know Your Customer) identity verification.</li>

<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended YouTube Channels</strong>: &ldquo;宏观洞察&rdquo; (Macro-Insight, for mainstream US political and economic views), &ldquo;爱丽的无废话财经&rdquo; (Alice&rsquo;s No-Nonsense Finance, for relatively objective analysis of China&rsquo;s situation), &ldquo;Mr. Edwin财经&rdquo; (Mr. Edwin Finance). He absorbs information, thinks, researches, and connects the dots to form his own knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Daily Life</strong>: Responds to comments and emails, makes short videos, has lunch and a nap, makes fruit and vegetable smoothies, snacks, has dinner, listens to audiobooks at night (prepares for bed at 9 PM), grows tomatoes, cucumbers, and flowers, and walks and dines with his family. His life is plain and simple.</li>
<li><strong>Clarification</strong>: Denies being a &ldquo;Trump fan&rdquo; and does not comment on quarrels between political figures.</li>

<li>Question: Does the teacher use Zi Wei Dou Shu (Purple Star Astrology), metaphysics, or similar methods to look at stocks or investment directions?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: In theory, Zi Wei Dou Shu could be used for stocks, and some friends use the I Ching for divination, but he has never actually used them for investment decisions, only for understanding his personal birth chart. He emphasizes that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with these tools themselves, but if the user is not proficient or has ill intentions (like fortune-tellers who often exaggerate problems to sell solutions), they can be misleading or even harmful. One should not blindly trust them unless one has studied them deeply and knows how to apply them correctly. He has, however, practiced technical analysis in the past.</li>

<p>In investing, besides wealth, we should also pursue inner peace.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This points to a higher goal of investing: peace of mind.</p></blockquote>

&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This explains a key reason for choosing index funds: to maintain a peaceful life.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Life is hard enough without feelings; feelings make life even harder.&rdquo;&hellip; Human nature makes the stock market even harder. So what to do? Human nature is natural, but how do you train yourself to be devoid of human nature?
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This combines life philosophy with investment psychology, pointing out that overcoming emotional human nature is key to investment success.</p></blockquote>

<p>This vividly illustrates the essence of leveraged investing: skillfully using low-cost capital (other people&rsquo;s chickens) to create more wealth for oneself (one&rsquo;s own chickens laying eggs).</p></blockquote>

<p>The prescription I give to everyone is unique; it&rsquo;s different for each person&hellip; With a Beta above 0.5, you will become wealthy.

<blockquote>
<p>If you listen to something, and after the person has finished speaking, you don&rsquo;t understand what they&rsquo;re talking about, it&rsquo;s probably because they don&rsquo;t understand it, not because you don&rsquo;t.
&ndash; Teacher James (quoting and agreeing with Rosemary&rsquo;s viewpoint)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This offers a method for judging whether an information provider truly understands the content they are presenting.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this session, Teacher James once again emphasized the core strategy of long-term investment in high-quality index funds (like QQQ) and encouraged investors to remain optimistic in the current market environment. He focused on the personalized needs of asset allocation, particularly providing several robust allocation plans for retirees, aimed at balancing returns and risks to ultimately achieve financial freedom and inner peace. Furthermore, from the height of life philosophy, the teacher elaborated on the importance of an investor&rsquo;s mindset, reminding investors to overcome the weaknesses of human nature. In the Q&amp;A session, he provided detailed answers to hot-topic questions from students regarding Taiwan&rsquo;s credit lines, how to explain investing to young people, the use of leverage, the mechanism of stablecoins, and their profound impact on the future financial landscape (especially the status of the US dollar and the stock market). Overall, this session offered a comprehensive guide for investors, encompassing macroeconomic outlooks, micro-level operational advice, and deep philosophical insights.</p>
