<p>This session revolves around the optimistic outlook for the investment market, driven by advancements in high-tech development and corporate profitability. The core viewpoint is that investors should remain extremely optimistic, invest long-term in funds like the Nasdaq-100 Index Fund (QQQ), and implement a reasonable asset allocation based on their personal circumstances to achieve wealth growth and inner peace. Additionally, it delves into the connection between life philosophy and investment mentality, as well as the potential impact of emerging financial tools like stablecoins.</p>

<li><strong>Rational Approach</strong>: Both life and investing require a rational attitude. If your investments make you anxious, it may indicate a flaw in your strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Long-Term Investing</strong>: To achieve peace of mind, choose long-term index investing. This allows you to avoid constantly watching the market and prevents your life and family from being disrupted by market volatility.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Solid Returns with Beta 0.5</strong>: Even with just 50% in QQQ (Beta 0.5) and 50% in cash (e.g., a money market fund with a hypothetical 4% return), the long-term annualized return can be substantial (e.g., 0.5 * 4% + 0.5 * 14% = 9%).</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation for Retirees</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Retirees with sufficient funds should prioritize stability over maximum returns.</li>
<li>Suggested allocations: 70% QQQ + 30% cash; 60% QQQ + 40% cash; or 50% QQQ + 50% cash.</li>
<li>Keep at least 30% in cash as a stabilizing force.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rebalancing Considerations</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If you have sufficient cash flow and reserves, there&rsquo;s no need to actively rebalance. Let QQQ grow through compounding.</li>
<li>If reserves are insufficient, sell a portion of QQQ when it has significant gains to increase your cash reserves.</li>
<li>Retirees can set aside 15 years of living expenses in cash and invest the rest in QQQ. When the cash is used up, withdraw half of the QQQ holdings into cash, and repeat the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation for Young People</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Set aside a 1-2 year emergency fund and prepare for children&rsquo;s tuition.</li>
<li>The remaining funds can be fully invested in QQQ.</li>
<li>Start conservatively when first entering the market and gradually increase your risk tolerance.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>CLC Beef Noodle Soup Analogy</strong>: Investment strategies are like beef noodle soup: there&rsquo;s clear broth, mild, spicy, and extra spicy. Investors can choose based on their risk appetite, but the goal is to avoid &ldquo;getting an upset stomach&rdquo; (suffering unbearable losses).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Life is hard enough without feelings; feelings make life even harder&rdquo;</strong>: Replace &ldquo;feelings&rdquo; (情) with &ldquo;human nature&rdquo; (人性), and the saying becomes: &ldquo;Human nature makes the stock market even harder.&rdquo; To succeed in investing, you must train yourself to overcome the emotional weaknesses of human nature, achieving a state of &ldquo;indifference to the market and money,&rdquo; feeling nothing about gains or losses.</li>
<li><strong>Separation of Tasks</strong>: Distinguish between your own tasks and others&rsquo; tasks. For example, a child&rsquo;s education is the parents&rsquo; task and should not be overly interfered with by grandparents.</li>
<li><strong>Live in the Present, No Regrets</strong>: &ldquo;Looking back on life, there is neither wind, nor rain, nor clear skies.&rdquo; What matters is the present moment; have no regrets.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correct Mistakes Promptly</strong>: If an initial investment strategy was wrong and led to losses, change it immediately rather than waiting to break even. The latter is a gambler&rsquo;s mentality.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Direction</strong>: Effort is meaningful only when the direction is correct. The right direction is proper asset allocation, index investing, and maintaining sufficient cash.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Awareness and Control</strong>: First, understand the risks (e.g., the market could drop 85% and stay there for 10 years). Then, control the risk through asset allocation (cash is a critical line of defense, like the air force and supplies in a battle).</li>
<li><strong>Buying Strategy</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The best option is to buy immediately when you have the money.</li>
<li>If buying in installments, do so at predetermined times and at the market price, regardless of market ups and downs.</li>
<li>&ldquo;He who buys is an apprentice; he who holds on for dear life is the master.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Wisdom of Borrowing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Money is only yours when it&rsquo;s in your pocket.&rdquo;</li>
<li>In low-interest-rate regions (like Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China), borrow money to invest. Use leverage to let &ldquo;other people&rsquo;s chickens lay eggs for you&rdquo; (generate returns with borrowed money) while your own &ldquo;chickens&rdquo; (assets) continue to grow.</li>
<li>Social security benefits and the like should be claimed as early as possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Individualized Advice</strong>: Teacher James emphasizes that his investment advice is a &ldquo;unique&rdquo; prescription for each person, tailored to their individual circumstances. There is no one-size-fits-all &ldquo;standard answer.&rdquo; For example, buying immediately at market price is ideal but not suitable for those with low psychological tolerance. A Beta of 1.0 or a 442 strategy (40% cash, 40% index, 20% leveraged index) offers high returns but also high risk. A Beta above 0.5 is enough to become wealthy.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing:
<ol>
<li>Successfully applied for a &ldquo;home equity line of credit&rdquo; in Taiwan with a limit of over NT$10 million, an interest rate of about 2.4%, and an interest-only period of 2 years, extendable once to 4 years. After 4 years, it can be converted to an &ldquo;overdraft account,&rdquo; where you only pay interest (rate around 2.5%) and can use the principal indefinitely.</li>
<li>Plans to start investing next week according to the teacher&rsquo;s 4-3-3 allocation (40% cash, 30% QQQ, 30% leveraged QQQ. Michel&rsquo;s understanding might differ slightly from the teacher&rsquo;s later clarification, which defined 433 as 40% cash, 30% index, 30% leveraged index).</li>
<li>Although he missed the lower entry points, he has come to realize that looking back 20 years from now, today&rsquo;s prices will all seem sweet.</li>
<li>Thanks the teacher for expanding his cognition and giving him the courage to use financial weapons. The bank&rsquo;s review process was strict, so getting the loan means the bank also considers the risk manageable. His wife being an employee of a listed company might have helped. He used to think he should never be in debt, but his perspective has now changed.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: The fact that the bank dared to lend to you means they have assessed the risk. The low interest rates in Taiwan are a great opportunity. The current price of QQQ (e.g., $70-80) makes little difference in the long run (e.g., when it reaches $80,000 in the future). He encourages buying as soon as possible. Investing with borrowed money is a capitalist awakening, not a rebellious act.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: The teacher recently discussed technical analysis on other platforms to guide people towards long-term investing. Could he briefly explain the differences, pros, and cons of short-term technical analysis versus long-term investing for new students?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: He respects short-term traders and their philosophies. He used to trade that way himself with good results (but emphasizes it&rsquo;s not for everyone). He compares short-term trading to being a race car driver, with its specific scenarios and risks. Sharing his technical analysis experience is a way to offer them some help or an alternative perspective (long-term investing), not to change them. He is practicing how to communicate with people of different viewpoints, as if talking to his 25-year-old self. He himself does not trade short-term now and does not recommend it to his students. The technical analysis he refers to is very short-term (determining long/short based on a single candlestick). He admires the focus and effort of short-term traders.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: Explained investing to a 14-year-old from a poor family. He used analogies (Is today better than five years ago? Is this generation better off than our parents&rsquo;? Will the future be even better? Farmland evolving from growing bananas to oil palms to durians to solar panels, constantly seeking higher returns) to illustrate that QQQ automatically weeds out the weak and keeps the strong, just like how the &ldquo;fertile field&rdquo; of American high-tech is constantly being optimized. The boy&rsquo;s eyes filled with hope when he saw how 50 Malaysian Ringgit could become tens of millions through decades of compounding. IAM feels that 80-90% of people around him don&rsquo;t understand QQQ and will persist in sharing one-on-one.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: (Mentioned later when answering IAM&rsquo;s question) Being able to plant the seed of wealth for a young person is to save a person, a family. It is a wonderful thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 1: Regarding asset allocation (e.g., 442, 433, 631), after doing his own homework, he found that risk tolerance is closely related to one&rsquo;s personal life situation (work, consumption). He asks the teacher to confirm if asset allocation should be strictly by percentage, or if the proportion of leveraged funds should not exceed the cash or original capital.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Strategies like 433 (40% cash, 30% index fund, 30% leveraged fund) or 442 (40% cash, 40% index, 20% leveraged index) aim to raise the Beta to 1.0 using leverage while maintaining the safety of cash, thereby hoping not to lose out on market returns. This is the highest-risk allocation that passed simulations, like a plane pulling up just after scraping the ground—highly efficient. But it&rsquo;s not the only option; for example, 50% QQQ + 50% cash used as collateral also works. For retirees, it&rsquo;s recommended to keep Beta below 0.8, have at least 30% cash, and the leveraged fund portion should not exceed the cash or original capital—the lower the better, or even none at all. Beta should not be lower than 0.5.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: How exactly does QQQ&rsquo;s mechanism of &ldquo;weeding out the weak&rdquo; work? Is it based on market capitalization comparison or a standard like outperforming the SPY?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: QQQ selects the top 100 non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq, ranked by market capitalization. Market Cap = Stock Price × Shares Outstanding. If a company performs poorly, its stock price falls, and its market cap drops out of the top 100, it gets removed. This has nothing to do with whether the company is profitable (e.g., Amazon and Tesla were included in their early, unprofitable days due to their large market caps). The S&amp;P 500, on the other hand, has other criteria like profitability. QQQ selects the top 100, while SPY selects the top 500; a more elite group (QQQ) will generally have better average performance. The Dow Jones 30 is an even older index construction method.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: He is confused about stablecoins (fiat-backed, commodity-backed, crypto-backed). The original purpose of cryptocurrency was decentralization, but stablecoins seem centralized, even managed by governments. What is their purpose? Why not just invest in fiat currencies, commodities, or the US dollar directly? Can stablecoins appreciate in value? What is their real use? Is there an arbitrage opportunity like the one between TSMC&rsquo;s ADR (TSM) and its Taiwan stock (2330)?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply:
<ul>
<li><strong>TSMC Price Difference</strong>: It&rsquo;s normal for the same asset to have different prices in different markets (US ADR vs. local Taiwan stock), just as the same product has different prices in different stores, determined by market supply and demand.</li>
<li><strong>Core Value of Stablecoins</strong>: It mainly lies in <strong>transaction efficiency</strong>. Digital currency transfers are nearly instantaneous and global, whereas cross-border fiat transfers take days.</li>
<li><strong>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC)</strong>: Europe, China, and others are developing CBDCs to improve the circulation efficiency of their own currencies. China is also promoting CIPS to bypass SWIFT.</li>
<li><strong>US Shift in Attitude Towards Stablecoins</strong>: The US initially suppressed digital currencies (e.g., dealing with Binance&rsquo;s CZ, certain crypto-related banks). However, after the Trump administration, it realized that the dollar&rsquo;s status could be challenged by highly efficient digital currencies. It then shifted to embracing and regulating existing private stablecoin issuers (like Circle), bringing them under supervision through measures like the &ldquo;Genius Act&rdquo; (likely a colloquial term for a stablecoin regulation bill) to maintain the dollar&rsquo;s dominance in the digital sphere.</li>
<li><strong>Stablecoins Do Not Appreciate</strong>: Stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) are pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Their reserves consist of equivalent amounts of short-term US Treasury bills and cash. Issuers profit by earning interest on these reserves, while the stablecoins themselves do not pay interest to holders.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Stablecoins</strong>: They are primarily used for rapid payments and settlements, especially in international trade or business-to-business transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Monetary Expansion Effect</strong>: When banks hold Treasuries and issue an equivalent amount of stablecoins, it effectively increases the money supply (the Treasuries still exist, and now stablecoins are also in circulation). This is a positive for the stock market because it increases the liquidity of money and boosts economic efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Us as Investors</strong>: The accelerated flow of money will stimulate the economy, which is good for the stock market. Banks gain a new source of interest income from issuing stablecoins, so bank stocks may benefit.</li>
<li><strong>Regulation and KYC</strong>: To prevent money laundering, etc., the issuance and trading of stablecoins will be strictly regulated, requiring KYC (Know Your Customer) identity verification.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: Does the teacher use Zi Wei Dou Shu (Purple Star Astrology), metaphysics, or similar methods to look at stocks or investment directions?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: In theory, Zi Wei Dou Shu could be used for stocks, and some friends use the I Ching for divination, but he has never actually used them for investment decisions, only for understanding his personal birth chart. He emphasizes that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with these tools themselves, but if the user is not proficient or has ill intentions (like fortune-tellers who often exaggerate problems to sell solutions), they can be misleading or even harmful. One should not blindly trust them unless one has studied them deeply and knows how to apply them correctly. He has, however, practiced technical analysis in the past.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>00670L (Yuanta S&amp;P 500 Futures ETF - USD Hedged)</strong>: It is currency-hedged. Holding both 00662 (Yuanta S&amp;P 500 ETF, unhedged) and 00670L can hedge against exchange rate risk.</li>
<li><strong>Taiwan Real Estate</strong>: The rental yield is low; he suggests selling it to invest in QQQ.</li>
<li><strong>TQQQ (3x Leveraged QQQ ETF)</strong>: Too volatile, not suitable for those seeking stability.</li>
<li><strong>Origin of Financial Products</strong>: Many will eventually integrate with Wall Street; it&rsquo;s hard to succeed without entering Wall Street.</li>
<li><strong>Bitcoin</strong>: Not recommended for ordinary investors. Stablecoins will be more widely used in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Alipay</strong>: It&rsquo;s backed by the Renminbi or credit cards, a different mechanism from digital stablecoins.</li>
<li><strong>Judging the Veracity of Information (Rosemary&rsquo;s view)</strong>: If you listen to someone talk for a long time and still don&rsquo;t understand what they&rsquo;re saying, it&rsquo;s likely they don&rsquo;t understand it themselves. Someone who truly understands can explain complex things clearly.</li>
<li><strong>Binance&rsquo;s Profitability</strong>: Earns in the tens of billions of US dollars per year, which is why banks are eager to enter the stablecoin market.</li>
<li><strong>Gold</strong>: It&rsquo;s impossible for it to outperform the S&amp;P 500; its main function is to hedge against inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Past Individual Stock Picking</strong>: He once achieved annualized returns of 19%-24%, but now chooses index investing (QQQ&rsquo;s annualized return is 14%; his return is lower than the index itself because Beta&lt;1, but his ROE is still high due to borrowing), placing a higher value on inner peace.</li>
<li><strong>Attitude Towards Life</strong>: &ldquo;Whatever, it&rsquo;s all good, no problem.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t argue with people, isn&rsquo;t affected by emotions, and focuses on his own affairs.</li>

<p>The market is about to hit a new high very soon, this is probably something that we investors&hellip; we really don&rsquo;t need to worry so much.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This viewpoint emphasizes confidence in the long-term market trend, encouraging investors to ignore short-term fluctuations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In investing, besides wealth, we should also pursue inner peace.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This points to a higher goal of investing: peace of mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do I use index funds? It&rsquo;s because I always want to solve one problem: I want to be able to not watch the market, I don&rsquo;t want to wake up nervous every day.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This explains a key reason for choosing index funds: to maintain a peaceful life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Life is hard enough without feelings; feelings make life even harder.&rdquo;&hellip; Human nature makes the stock market even harder. So what to do? Human nature is natural, but how do you train yourself to be devoid of human nature?
&ndash; Teacher James</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This combines life philosophy with investment psychology, pointing out that overcoming emotional human nature is key to investment success.</p>

<p>He who buys is an apprentice; he who holds on for dear life is the master.

<p>The prescription I give to everyone is unique; it&rsquo;s different for each person&hellip; With a Beta above 0.5, you will become wealthy.

<blockquote>
<p>Once stablecoins are in play, the US dollar&rsquo;s hegemony will gain the upper hand yet again.
&ndash; Teacher James</p>

<p>This analyzes how the US, by regulating and absorbing stablecoins, could further consolidate the hegemony of the US dollar.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you listen to something, and after the person has finished speaking, you don&rsquo;t understand what they&rsquo;re talking about, it&rsquo;s probably because they don&rsquo;t understand it, not because you don&rsquo;t.

<p>In this session, Teacher James once again emphasized the core strategy of long-term investment in high-quality index funds (like QQQ) and encouraged investors to remain optimistic in the current market environment. He focused on the personalized needs of asset allocation, particularly providing several robust allocation plans for retirees, aimed at balancing returns and risks to ultimately achieve financial freedom and inner peace. Furthermore, from the height of life philosophy, the teacher elaborated on the importance of an investor&rsquo;s mindset, reminding investors to overcome the weaknesses of human nature. In the Q&amp;A session, he provided detailed answers to hot-topic questions from students regarding Taiwan&rsquo;s credit lines, how to explain investing to young people, the use of leverage, the mechanism of stablecoins, and their profound impact on the future financial landscape (especially the status of the US dollar and the stock market). Overall, this session offered a comprehensive guide for investors, encompassing macroeconomic outlooks, micro-level operational advice, and deep philosophical insights.</p>

      <description>In this session, Mr. James emphasizes the core philosophy of long-term investing, which is to ignore short-term market fluctuations and focus on quality assets (like the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund). He delves into strategies for personal wealth accumulation within the capitalist system, including correctly understanding risk, rationally using leverage (advising conservatism for most), and balancing wealth inheritance with life&amp;#39;s meaning. The core message is that through the right investment mindset and methods, ordinary people can achieve financial freedom and live a fulfilling life, rather than merely chasing money.</description>

<p>Mr. James&rsquo;s core viewpoints in this session revolve around <strong>long-term investing, ignoring market noise, understanding the essence of capitalism, and balancing wealth with life</strong>. He emphasizes that investors should focus on quality passive ETFs like the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQQ) and possess the patience and optimism for long-term holding. Simultaneously, he deeply analyzes the impact of the capitalist system on different social classes, how to utilize capital markets to achieve personal and family financial freedom, and explores profound topics such as the relationship between wealth accumulation and life happiness, family relationships, children&rsquo;s education, elderly care for parents, and wealth inheritance.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No need to pay attention to market signals</strong>: Market disturbances (like tariffs, wars) are irrelevant to long-term investing; the market will eventually rise, and approaching or even setting new highs is normal. Investors need not worry about short-term signals.
<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> The current market is full of turmoil, yet it&rsquo;s close to setting new highs, proving that short-term signals are inconsequential.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Learn from history, understand the present</strong>: The century-long history of the U.S. stock market shows that while it doesn&rsquo;t repeat, it rhymes astonishingly. Understanding history helps solidify long-term investment beliefs. Mr. James shares insights based on his 40 years of market experience and understanding of 200 years of U.S. market history.</li>
<li><strong>Optimism and patience</strong>: Investors should always be extremely optimistic and unaffected by external pessimism and fear-mongering. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t listen or look, it doesn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo; Wealth is worth waiting for; investing requires patience.</li>
<li><strong>Technical analysis is ineffective</strong>: Those who believe technical analysis is effective haven&rsquo;t truly grasped investing. Market fluctuations can sometimes be like &ldquo;madness&rdquo;; no need to dance to its tune.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQQ)</strong>: This is currently the fastest-growing passive ETF globally, suitable for young investors to accelerate asset appreciation. Mr. James provides links to resources for investing in Nasdaq 100 Index Funds worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Learning resources</strong>: Recommends watching a series of videos (e.g., 00451 &ldquo;Value Investing Lecture&rdquo; as a compulsory course for newcomers, as well as 398, 399, 400, etc.), learning them in conjunction with the market conditions at the time to achieve a solid grasp.</li>
<li><strong>Getting started for young professionals/small investors</strong>: It&rsquo;s advised to set aside an emergency fund for six months to a year before starting to invest in QQQ or 00662 (a Taiwanese ETF tracking Nasdaq 100). Buy whenever you have money, don&rsquo;t try to time the market, buy at market price.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systemic traps of capitalism</strong>: Mr. James quotes and agrees with a YouTuber&rsquo;s perspective that capitalism is designed to favor the rich, reflected in:
<ul>
<li><strong>Tax mechanisms</strong>: Investment income (e.g., U.S. Long-term Capital Gains, tax-free for singles up to $40k/couples up to $80k, with rates of 15%-20% above that) is taxed at much lower rates than labor income (up to 37%), benefiting long-term investors. Taiwan doesn&rsquo;t even have capital gains tax.</li>
<li><strong>Triple risks for the middle class</strong>: Job, company stock, and property near the company are highly intertwined. If the company has problems, one might lose their job, stock value, and property (or face mortgage pressure) simultaneously. Advice: Sell company stock promptly and reinvest in QQQ; buy a house only after achieving financial freedom (&ldquo;buying a house should be like buying slippers&rdquo;).</li>
<li><strong>Differences in borrowing</strong>: The rich borrow money to get richer (investment), while the middle class borrows money to become poorer (consumption).</li>
<li><strong>Differences in income growth</strong>: Income from physical labor struggles to keep pace with inflation and asset appreciation.</li>
<li><strong>Differences in offspring development</strong>: Middle-class children rely on &ldquo;involution&rdquo; (cram schools, prestigious universities, spending hundreds of thousands to get into private schools), while wealthy children can pursue their interests and grow up happily.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of financial bubbles</strong>: The middle class is forced to sell assets at low prices when bubbles burst because they can&rsquo;t hold on, while the rich have the money and opportunity to buy the dip.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Utilizing capitalism</strong>: Despite its pitfalls, the capital market is an important way for ordinary people to bridge the wealth gap and share the dividends of social progress.
<ul>
<li><strong>At the national level</strong>: If citizens all become capitalists, holding shares in globally competitive companies (like TSMC, Apple), they can enjoy the benefits of globalization while &ldquo;transferring&rdquo; negative externalities of production (like pollution). Citizens should ponder: Is it better to be proud of owning a factory, or proud of owning shares in that factory?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Borrow 100 Million&rdquo; thought experiment</strong>: If someone were willing to lend you 100 million (any currency) at 5% interest, to be repaid in 40 years, would you dare to borrow it? Those who dare and know how to use it possess a rich mindset, because this money, through investment, can generate returns far exceeding the interest, potentially allowing for immediate retirement. The key is whether you have the credit or assets to borrow this sum.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration from Trump&rsquo;s proposed &ldquo;Great Child America Act&rdquo;</strong>: Investing $1,000 annually for newborns from a young age cultivates financial literacy and long-term compound interest awareness, reflecting a nation&rsquo;s soft power. This is more meaningful than direct subsidies.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beyond &ldquo;cost&rdquo; thinking</strong>: Falling in love, getting married, and having children should not be calculated as &ldquo;costs.&rdquo; With a long-term wealth perspective (e.g., 1 million becoming 1 billion in 40 years), money is meant to be spent, and family is for sharing love.
<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> If you only think about the immediate 1 million not being enough, you miss the possibility of becoming a billionaire enjoying life in the future. By 60-70, even with money, you might not be able to make up for regrets from youth (like having children).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Die with Zero&rdquo; philosophy</strong>: Life should be fully experienced, rather than dying with a huge fortune, which is the tragedy of &ldquo;having nothing but money.&rdquo; Money should be spent wisely to create beautiful memories.</li>
<li><strong>Financial wisdom for couples</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic security</strong>: The higher-earning spouse should proactively transfer a portion of their funds (e.g., 50k from a 150k salary) to the other&rsquo;s account, giving them financial freedom and security, avoiding the need to &ldquo;report everything&rdquo; or &ldquo;ask for money.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Common goals</strong>: Couples should have aligned financial views, invest together, and not bicker over money (like who does the dishes or takes out the trash). A home needs love.</li>
<li><strong>Improve oneself first</strong>: In a family, first make yourself &ldquo;worthy of being loved.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Becoming the &ldquo;big tree&rdquo; of the family</strong>: Through long-term investment, everyone has the potential (hundreds of thousands becoming hundreds of millions, millions becoming billions) to become the family&rsquo;s economic pillar, providing shelter for loved ones.</li>
<li><strong>Elderly care for parents</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Health is the biggest money-saver</strong>: Instead of worrying if pensions are sufficient, care more about parents&rsquo; health, manage their blood pressure and blood sugar, ensure they take medication on time, and have regular check-ups (e.g., for macular degeneration, joints, carotid artery stents). Healthy parents mean a lighter burden for children.</li>
<li><strong>Cost estimation</strong>: If parents are completely dependent, a caregiver plus basic expenses might cost NT$80,000-100,000 per month. Mr. James&rsquo;s mother cost about NT$10 million over 10 years.</li>
<li><strong>Plan early</strong>: When children are 30, parents are around 60. Significant expenses might arise after age 80. Regularly investing NT$1,000-2,000 per month for parents can accumulate a considerable pension fund after 20 years.</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplify investing</strong>: Once asset allocation is done, you can set it to &ldquo;autopilot,&rdquo; no need to watch the market daily or analyze asset performance. Spending 5 minutes once a year for rebalancing is sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>Risk awareness</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Market goes to zero&rdquo; test</strong>: Before any investment decision, ask yourself, &ldquo;If this investment goes to zero tomorrow, can I handle it? Even if I can&rsquo;t sell stocks for three years, can I survive?&rdquo; If not, the risk is too high.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity risk</strong>: Some markets or specific situations (like some mainland China ETFs in 2022) may experience situations where you want to sell but cannot.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage risk</strong>: Margin loans (e.g., from a brokerage account) are extremely risky. A market downturn can lead to margin calls or even negative equity (e.g., stocks drop to $800k, but you borrowed $1 million, owing $200k). Personal loans (with stable income, used for investment) are relatively manageable because they are not directly tied to stock market value for forced liquidation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The essence of learning</strong>: It&rsquo;s not just about learning what works, but more importantly, learning that &ldquo;these things are useless&rdquo; (like technical analysis, economic analysis, business cycle indicators). This conclusion is reached after understanding these tools.</li>

Advised such individuals not to borrow easily; they should first build a solid foundation with their own funds and become mentally strong enough before considering advanced operations.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: Strongly agree. Investors first need to experience market volatility (e.g., a 10-15% correction) with their own funds to confirm they can tolerate it before considering borrowing. For retirees:
<ul>
<li>Personal loans: If there&rsquo;s no stable income for repayment, a market downturn will force selling stocks to repay debt, which is not recommended.</li>
<li>Mortgages: A home equity line of credit (HELOC, interest-only payments, like in the US) might be considered; however, mortgages requiring principal and interest payments are not recommended due to the large amounts involved.</li>
<li>Core principle: For any leveraged investment, consider, &ldquo;If the stock drops to zero, the loan still needs to be repaid. Can I handle it?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Sharing 1: As a listener for over two years, he gradually shifted personal funds, private equity, trusts, and insurance products into QQQ and domestic Nasdaq ETFs. Due to excessive optimism, he used margin (brokerage account overdraft to buy) from late 2023 to early 2024, almost at 1:1 leverage. He then encountered the &ldquo;tariff war&rdquo; and liquidity issues in the domestic ETF market (e.g., 513100), where some ETFs hit their limit down and couldn&rsquo;t be sold. He was forced to significantly deleverage the next day, wiping out much of the previous year&rsquo;s profits. His father&rsquo;s account, with no leverage and regular investments, hit an all-time high. Profound realization: Don&rsquo;t rush to make money; slow is fast, and safety is more important. Personal cash flow and future income expectations are crucial when using leverage. Also, in panic, he cleared out QLD from his Hong Kong account, missing the subsequent rally. This experience reminded him of the 2015 A-share market crash, also involving margin calls and being unable to sell for three consecutive days.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: Sams&rsquo; experience is very typical. Markets have liquidity risks, and margin risks are enormous, potentially leading to margin calls or even owing the brokerage money. Repeatedly emphasized the importance of the &ldquo;market goes to zero test.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t test human nature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Investing allows one to control their own destiny. He experienced his company being acquired, then another company he co-founded being acquired (sold to Evergrande, which later defaulted, and got entangled in lawsuits), and personally shutting down an underperforming branch (decided to close the Chongqing branch after a three-hour walk with his boss; employees were given N+1 severance the next day). Because he had investments as a backup, he was more composed when facing these changes. Colleagues without investments (like some branch managers) felt lost about their future. Insight: Whether in good times or bad, hold on to good assets.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: All things have unexpected events (companies go bankrupt, properties get damaged). When investing, first think about risk. Jobs and individual stocks carry high risks. QQQ will also drop significantly. Only invest money you won&rsquo;t need for 15-20-30 years. Retirees need to set aside about 15 years of cash for living expenses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: Mr. James once suggested 70% QQQ / 30% cash, and allocating 2% to leveraged funds (like QLD) in down years. He wanted to confirm:
<ol>
<li>Can mainland China and Hong Kong accounts be treated as one, with a synchronized 70/30 allocation?</li>
<li>Since transferring funds out of mainland China is troublesome, should more leveraged funds be allocated in Hong Kong?</li>
<li>If the market falls at year-end, is the 2% allocation to leveraged funds based on 2% of total assets or only 2% of Hong Kong assets?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s reply:
<ol>
<li>For beginners or those sensitive to volatility, 70/30 (QQQ/cash) or even 60/40 is a safe starting point. No need to rush into leveraged funds. Because even if the overall drop isn&rsquo;t large, the violent fluctuations of leveraged funds themselves can cause anxiety (e.g., only focusing on QLD dropping 5%, not seeing that cash doesn&rsquo;t drop).</li>
<li>Beta can start at a lower level (e.g., 0.6-0.8) and gradually increase with experience and asset growth.</li>
<li>Regarding the 2% QLD allocation: It can be calculated based on Hong Kong assets or total assets. However, note that leveraged funds usually cannot be used as collateral for bank loans (e.g., at HSBC). If QLD proportion is too high, it might affect future collateralized financing plans.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Listening to Mr. James&rsquo;s class is like learning life philosophy; investing is a battle against human nature. Experienced the recent market correction (what the teacher called a &ldquo;slap in the face&rdquo; market). Although he wanted to hold on, he was scared and sold half of his holdings, including some individual stocks like Nvidia.</li>
<li>Question: His Roth IRA account is small, and he&rsquo;s nearing retirement. He wants to know if an allocation of 60% QQQ + 10% TQQQ + 30% cash, or 70% QQQ + 20% TQQQ + 10% cash, resulting in an overall Beta of around 0.8, is robust enough while also providing growth.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s reply: A 60/10/30 (QQQ/TQQQ/cash) configuration, with a Beta around 0.8, is very good. Beta will increase as the leveraged portion grows. For those afraid of volatility, an initial Beta of 0.6-0.8 is sufficient.</li>

Investing slowly and waiting for the compounding effect is a good choice.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: Slow is fast. Don&rsquo;t use money you need to earn money you don&rsquo;t need. Life should be about reducing regrets, not chasing empty fame and fortune. Enjoy the fruits of enterprises (like Nvidia) through tools like QQQ, without bearing the immense pressure of the operators.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Introduced to Mr. James&rsquo;s philosophy by a friend in 2018/2019. As a stock market novice, he was deeply inspired and immediately adjusted his strategy, investing borrowed funds and continuing with regular contributions. He once participated in short-term trading studies (joined a stock reading club) but found it arduous and the ROE (Return on Equity) not high. He had to watch the market daily, research US stocks, Taiwan stocks, margin changes, aiming for a 10-20% annualized return, and only dared to invest a portion of his capital (e.g., 10-30%). So he gave up, focused on his main job and long-term investing, and now lives a peaceful and prosperous life (meditating morning and evening). When sharing his philosophy with friends and colleagues, he found they hesitated to invest for their own long-term (feeling 20-30 years is too long), but were more receptive to investing for their children, which might then lead them to participate themselves. Having experienced 00662 (a Taiwanese Nasdaq 100 ETF) dropping from over 50 to the 40s and persisting in buying, he is now calm about current market fluctuations.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s comments: Many short-term traders only look at the ROI (Return on Investment) of individual trades, ignoring the ROE (Return on Equity) on their total assets. They might achieve a high ROI with a small amount of capital, but it contributes little to overall wealth growth. For example, with 1 million in capital, using 30,000 to make 30,000 is a 100% ROI, but only a 3% ROE. Whereas we aim for a 10% return on the entire 1 million, which is 100,000.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Noticed Mr. James recently emphasizing conservatism more, suggesting a 30% cash position (earlier it was 10-20%). Is this due to varying student experience levels or other considerations? He himself targets a Beta of 1.0, holds leveraged funds, has little cash, and would need to reduce leveraged funds to reach 30% cash.
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s reply: Yes, this is because students come from diverse backgrounds; many are novices or cannot withstand significant volatility. A 30% (or even 40%) cash position is a &ldquo;plain beef noodle soup&rdquo; style basic version, suitable for everyone to start with. Experienced investors who can tolerate risk can adjust it themselves, choosing a &ldquo;mildly spicy&rdquo; or &ldquo;extra spicy&rdquo; allocation. Asset allocation is very personal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Regarding wealth inheritance. Warren Buffett&rsquo;s testamentary portfolio (90% S&amp;P 500 + 10% short-term bonds) is suitable due to his vast assets. For ordinary people whose descendants have no interest in investing, how should a &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; trust asset allocation plan be established? (Citing Anita Mui&rsquo;s trust case)
<ul>
<li>Mr. James&rsquo;s reply:
<ul>
<li>Firstly, children&rsquo;s moral character and values education (quoting Lin Zexu: &ldquo;If my descendants are like me, what&rsquo;s the use of leaving them money? If my descendants are not like me, what&rsquo;s the use of leaving them money?&rdquo;) is more important than wealth inheritance. Wealth should be the icing on the cake.</li>
<li>One can start considering gifting when their assets exceed 50 times their annual expenses.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not advisable to easily set up a private non-profit foundation unless the children are genuinely committed, otherwise, it might become a burden or a management problem.</li>
<li>Trust selection: Trust services from large financial institutions (like HSBC, Charles Schwab) are generally more stable than private family offices (even if the institution fails, assets are protected, like Credit Suisse being taken over by UBS), but offer less flexibility. One can set up a portfolio like 70% QQQ / 30% cash (or short-term bonds/money market funds), with a rule to withdraw 2% annually, achieving perpetuity. The key is simplicity and low management fees. Private family offices might offer comprehensive services, but institutional trusts focus more on asset management and distribution.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Market fluctuations have nothing to do with me anymore. The market might be full of turmoil, tariffs coming and going, wars still ongoing, but the market is already close to new highs. So this is why you don&rsquo;t need to care about market signals; they are not important, not important at all.
&ndash; Mr. James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view emphasizes that investors should ignore short-term market noise and focus on long-term trends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This capitalism is a systemic trap&hellip; it&rsquo;s advantageous to the rich, to wealthy people.
&ndash; Mr. James (quoting and agreeing with a YouTuber&rsquo;s perspective)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view reveals the inherent mechanisms of wealth distribution under the capitalist system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earning money through physical labor will never keep up with inflation, let alone the speed of asset appreciation.
&ndash; Mr. James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view highlights the fundamental difference between labor income and capital appreciation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you calculate falling in love, getting married, and having children in terms of cost, then you&rsquo;re being too meticulous&hellip; We are rich people; money is meant to be spent. We&rsquo;ll have more money than we can spend in a lifetime, so if we get married and have children, let&rsquo;s have a few more to spend it together.
&ndash; Mr. James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view reminds people to look beyond utilitarian calculations in important life choices, focus on emotions and experiences, and view them from a long-term wealth perspective.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slowly is fast. You will all become a big tree for your family.
&ndash; Mr. James (combining the &ldquo;slow is fast&rdquo; and &ldquo;become a big tree&rdquo; concepts)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view encourages long-term patient investing, believing in the power of compounding to enable individuals to become the economic pillars of their families.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For any asset allocation, just ask yourself: what if the market goes to zero tomorrow, how would you fare? Ah, if you find out it&rsquo;s not okay, if I&rsquo;m finished if it goes to zero, then you should quickly adjust your asset allocation.
&ndash; Mr. James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view provides an ultimate test for measuring risk tolerance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone needs to know that in investing, all things can have unexpected outcomes. Your company can go bankrupt in an instant&hellip; So for any investment, the first thing to think about is what if this investment is destroyed, goes to zero, what will you do?
&ndash; Mr. James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view emphasizes risk awareness, that any investment should first consider the worst-case scenario.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think about making this money too quickly; a bit slower and safer might be better.
&ndash; Sams</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sams, after a severe setback with leverage, gained a profound understanding of prudent investing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s the biggest advantage of investing well? It&rsquo;s that you can control your own destiny.
&ndash; Sams</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sams shared how investing gave him more agency and security amidst career and life changes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spending five minutes a year is enough. There&rsquo;s absolutely no need to care about market fluctuations; it&rsquo;s completely meaningless&hellip; Living a good life is the purpose of life.

<p>In this CLEC sharing session, Mr. James once again emphasized the importance of long-term holding of quality assets (especially the Nasdaq 100 Index Fund) and reminded investors to ignore market noise and focus on their own investment discipline. He deeply analyzed the operational mechanisms of capitalism, pointing out that ordinary people can achieve wealth growth through capital markets and escape the &ldquo;laborer mindset.&rdquo; The discussion covered several important topics, including risk management (especially a cautious attitude towards using leverage, advising most to start with a conservative cash ratio, and conducting the &ldquo;market goes to zero&rdquo; test), the wisdom of wealth inheritance (emphasizing children&rsquo;s moral education first and suggesting simple, sustainable trust solutions through financial institutions), elderly care for parents (prioritizing health management over financial worries), and balancing investment with life happiness (avoiding excessive calculation of &ldquo;costs&rdquo; in life, living in the present, and achieving the state of &ldquo;Die with Zero&rdquo;). Participants&rsquo; sharing also provided valuable practical experiences and lessons, particularly regarding leverage risks, market liquidity, and the profound impact of investment on personal control over one&rsquo;s destiny. Overall, this session aimed to help investors establish the correct investment mindset and methodology to achieve long-term financial health and a fulfilling life.</p>

      <description>In this episode, James first announced the upcoming two-week Clubhouse hiatus and then emphasized that market volatility is normal and there&amp;#39;s no need to over-analyze the reasons behind it. The core arguments revolved around the importance of long-term investing and index funds (especially the Nasdaq 100), and discussed the selection of specific ETFs (such as 00864B/00865B, BRK, HXQ). He also shared his fantasies about the future development of AI, exploring its potential impact on social structures, work, and the meaning of life. The Q&amp;amp;A session covered a range of practical issues, including market predictions, asset allocation ratios (70/30 rule, Beta value), ETF selection in different countries, digital currency risks, differences in investment philosophies between spouses, and retirement cash reserves.</description>

<li><strong>Historical Experience</strong>: Watching videos since 2018 can provide insights into investor sentiment and responses during market fluctuations, giving a sense of the long-term perspective.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stay Optimistic</strong>: Investors need to be extremely optimistic, always facing the sunlight, believing that the market will be good in the long run, even if there is a world war, the market still exists and continues to rise (only rises, never falls).</li>
<li><strong>Investment Target Selection</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>00864B vs 00865B (Taiwan Bond ETF)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>00864B: Pays dividends, generating National Health Insurance Supplementary Premium (2.11%), requires manual reinvestment (with handling fees, easy to forget resulting in no compounding), dividends are considered overseas income (requires declaration if it exceeds the limit, but usually not a problem with annual income below NT$1 million; according to student feedback, it is exempt from the second-generation health insurance supplementary premium).</li>
<li>00865B: Does not pay dividends, avoiding the above problems, simpler and more effective in the long run. Low trading volume is not a problem (market makers provide liquidity), initial performance differences will shrink as scale increases. <strong>Strongly recommend switching to 00865B; convenience is a value.</strong> Conversion will incur a one-time transaction cost, but worth it in the long run.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/B)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Not recommended for investment</strong>. Reason: Actively managed fund, more volatile than the index; times are changing, performance has lagged behind the S&amp;P 500; uncertainty after Buffett (&ldquo;the devil will come out&rdquo;); learning Buffett should be about learning his long-term investment spirit, investment discourse (such as the definition of investment), rather than stock picking. Investing in the S&amp;P 500 may be better than investing in BRK.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation (Beta)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic Principle</strong>: It is recommended that most people allocate an investment portfolio with a Beta value of less than 1, such as 70% index funds + 30% cash/money market funds (Beta is approximately 0.7).</li>
<li><strong>Risk Tolerance</strong>: The recent 20% drop has made many people uncomfortable (even those with a Beta of 1.2 configured at 4:4:2), indicating that actual risk tolerance may be lower than expected. Do not sacrifice the comfort of holding enough cash (&ldquo;don&rsquo;t gamble with the money you need for the money you don&rsquo;t need&rdquo;) for an extra 1-2% of return.</li>
<li><strong>Adjustment</strong>: If the initial Beta is high (such as 1.2), it is recommended to review it at the end of each year. If the market rises, you can sell part of the leveraged/index position and supplement the cash to more than 30%, gradually reducing the Beta to below 1.0. Consider smart rebalancing after the Beta is below 1.0.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>AI Optimized Future</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Productivity greatly improved, most output is completed by AI (robots), and the cost of goods approaches zero.</li>
<li>Total social wealth accelerates, basic living needs (food, clothing, housing, transportation) may be free, uniformly supplied by the state/society (AI robots complete production, construction, and maintenance).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Social Structure Changes</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Classes Still Exist</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Capitalists</strong>: Earn profits by investing in and holding the means of production (AI systems) without labor; the wealthiest. Everyone can become a capitalist (just need to know how to invest).</li>
<li><strong>High-Tech Workers</strong>: Personnel who maintain and manage AI systems, with excellent income, can enjoy entertainment beyond basic needs (such as space travel), but may fall into the &ldquo;cared-for&rdquo; class if they stop working and do not become capitalists.</li>
<li><strong>Cared-For Class (approximately 80%)</strong>: No need to work, basic life is guaranteed (food, clothing, housing, transportation, medical care), but cannot enjoy additional entertainment or resources. The standard of living may be similar to the current upper-middle class, but without work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Philosophical Challenges</strong>:
<ul>
<li>When most people do not need to contribute for livelihood (&ldquo;nothing to serve&rdquo;), what is the meaning and purpose of life? (Analogous to being idle after retirement). May lead to widespread depression or social problems.</li>
<li>Human development may enter a stage of eternal life, facing greater philosophical and existential questions.</li>
<li>The focus should shift from &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; to &ldquo;the meaning of life.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Implications for Investors</strong>:
<ul>
<li>As capitalists, there is no need to worry about job loss due to AI development; on the contrary, they will become wealthier.</li>
<li>Start investing now to become part of the capitalist class.</li>

<li>Question: SPY and QQQ have risen for three days, will they continue to rise or fall next week?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Short-term market cannot be predicted, like flipping a coin. We invest for the long term (20+ years), focusing on long-term trends. Buy when you have money, never sell. Don&rsquo;t try to predict next week&rsquo;s market; ask the temple or the &ldquo;stock god&rdquo; in Clubhouse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing: Just started learning from the teacher&rsquo;s course two months ago, introduced by a friend in the United States. Currently in the learning stage, and has invested in some QQQ (cost between 515-530). After returning to Taiwan, considering investing in 00662. In the process of canceling previous insurance and converting individual stocks to 00662.</li>
<li>Question: Should I invest in US stocks (Firstrade account, worried about political risks in Taiwan for the child) or Taiwan stocks 00662? How to allocate at the beginning?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Recommend investing in 00662 in Taiwan, no need to use a US broker (Firstrade). It&rsquo;s better for the child to rely on themselves rather than worry about politics. When starting to learn, it is recommended to divide the total funds into three parts: 1/3 buy 00662 immediately, 1/3 buy in batches over the next 3-6 months, and 1/3 hold in cash. The ultimate goal is 70% 00662 + 30% cash. Then slowly learn whether and how to allocate leveraged funds (adjust the Beta value to 0.8-0.9).</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Who are QQQ and SPHD suitable for in terms of capital size?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: (Points out that students should watch the videos for repeated questions) This is a consideration for retirees. Need to calculate annual expenses after retirement. If 50 times the expenses equals your total assets, you can invest in QQQ (equivalent to a 2% annual withdrawal rate). If 2% is not enough, you need 3%, you may consider the S&amp;P 500. Only consider SPHD if you need even higher (~3.5-4%). Non-retirees should prioritize the high-growth QQQ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Explain Beta value. Beta=1 is synchronized with the market? Beta=1.2 is 1.2 times the volatility? Is the Beta of an 80% QQQ + 20% SGOV portfolio 0.8?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Basic understanding is correct. Beta measures the volatility of an asset relative to the market. The Beta of an 80/20 portfolio is approximately 0.8. (Reminds again that the videos explain it)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: Will the principal of SGOV (Short-Term US Treasury ETF) fall and lose money?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: The principal risk is extremely low, almost no losses (except for minor fluctuations before and after dividend payments). SGOV invests in short-term Treasury bills (T-Bills) issued by the US Treasury Department with a maturity of 0-3 months (or within one year), backed by the credit of the United States.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Joined for more than a month and reviewed the market decline in 2022 and the teacher&rsquo;s videos (especially #398 graduation episode, learned investment psychology).</li>
<li>Question 1: In January 2023 (#401), the teacher used technical indicators (50/100-day moving average crossover) to judge the market bottom and predict that 2023 would be a bull market, which was also verified afterwards. However, in later videos (#491), he emphasized not to predict market cycles and not to look at macroeconomic indicators (prosperity signals, macroeconomics, inventory cycles, etc.). Why this change? Are these indicators really useless in the long run? What was the basis for judging the bottom (just because of being optimistic about the stock market)? Should we just follow discipline and rebalance once a year?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: QQQ includes many industries (semiconductors, software, AI, biotechnology, retail such as Costco, Pepsico, Amazon, Google, Apple, etc.), and indicators for a single industry or country (such as Taiwan semiconductor economy, Taiwan prosperity signals, US prosperity signals) cannot reflect the overall index. Looking at all indicators is the same as looking at the index itself, so it is better to just focus on QQQ. The judgment in early 2023 was based on 40 years of experience (calculated that the 6-month moving average would cross upward), which is difficult to convey (&ldquo;unspeakable&rdquo;), and teaching technical analysis may cause students to misuse it and be harmed (&ldquo;go crazy&rdquo;), so it is not taught. Adhering to long-term investment discipline and holding enough cash buffer (such as 30%) is a more reliable method. Even if judging the bottom at that time, all cash would not be invested (such as still maintaining Beta 0.7), still maintaining a margin of safety. No need to take too much risk for small potential gains (referring to Buffett&rsquo;s philosophy).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: About the currency hedging of 00670L (Taiwan Leveraged QQQ ETF). Is the impact of exchange rate fluctuations significant in the long run? If the US dollar falls sharply (such as 1:13 against the Taiwan dollar), how will 00670L perform? (The teacher mentioned before that 00670L performs poorly when the US dollar rises)
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: 00670L is usually paired with 00865B (cash/short-term bonds). Exchange rate fluctuations have a hedging effect on both (when the US dollar rises, the hedging cost of 00670L increases, but the value of US dollar assets increases; the opposite is true when the US dollar falls). In the long run, exchange rate fluctuations are normal (such as the Taiwan dollar fluctuating between 28-32), but there is no fixed trend, and the expected value is zero. Currency hedging itself has a cost (wasting funds), which may not be necessary in the long run (it is recommended that fund companies consider canceling it), but the ETF is designed that way, and it does not hurt. The key is whether 00670L can achieve approximately twice the return of 00662 in the long run.</li>

<li>Sharing: Trump mentioned that 5.6 trillion in foreign investment may be invested in the United States in the future (may be exaggerated, even if halved, 2.8 trillion is also considerable), but the direction is beneficial to AI and QQQ. Observed that QQQ rebounded more strongly than SPY, DIA, and BRK recently, confirming the teacher&rsquo;s point of view (such as Katy Wood investing in AI-related companies when she saw mobile internet access). Compare the leadership styles of Chinese and American leaders (leader vs. manager) and the direction of attracting foreign investment (Saudi Arabia/Dubai vs. Myanmar/Vietnam/Malaysia).</li>
<li>Question: Please explain the difference between CIPS (Chinese RMB Cross-Border Payment System) and SWIFT. Why is CIPS faster (completed in 6 seconds)? Why does SWIFT take days? Can SWIFT be improved? Will this affect the status of the US dollar (AI replied that the two will coexist)?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: SWIFT is based on the traditional telegram transmission model (like a relay station), and information needs to be transferred through multiple layers (local bank -&gt; regional major bank -&gt; central bank -&gt; SWIFT center (Switzerland) -&gt; the other party&rsquo;s central bank -&gt; the other party&rsquo;s head office -&gt; the other party&rsquo;s branch), involving compliance checks (anti-money laundering), time difference, manual processing, etc., so it takes a long time (2+ days). CIPS is a modern real-time gross settlement system, similar to domestic payment systems in various countries, point-to-point or directly cleared through the central bank, and the speed is fast. CIPS uses RMB and is an alternative developed to deal with SWIFT being weaponized (such as sanctions against Russia), making people distrust the US dollar system. US sanctions opened a Pandora&rsquo;s box. Currently, CIPS is small (such as shipbuilding transactions between Malaysia and China), but it represents the trend of &ldquo;currency wars&rdquo; (such as Saudi Arabia and China being linked). Trump&rsquo;s visit to Saudi Arabia may be related to maintaining the status of the US dollar. Just watch the show.</li>

The latest link (showing content updated on April 26, such as 70/30 allocation recommendations) has been shared in the chat area. New links will be provided regularly (such as weekly or monthly) in the future. The teacher himself uses a more advanced personal &ldquo;Super AI&rdquo; account (possibly GPT-4o or higher, with memory function) to process and extract information, and then &ldquo;feeds&rdquo; the essence to this publicly shared GPTs version (similar to DIPS extraction).

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Because of recent trade tensions, I re-listened to the 2022 recordings. Two points are profound: 1. The biggest risk is missing the market (leaving the market). 2. Focus on long-term returns, not short-term fluctuations/shocks. The market is full of contradictory information (repeated presidential statements, pessimistic commentators) and bad news, but it often rebounds unintentionally. Friends who wait for a clear trend (such as buying after the big trend comes back) miss the rise. No one can accurately time the market. It is extremely difficult to obtain stable and high returns in the long term (such as an annualized return of 10% or more), like the sustained performance of top athletes (such as playing ball for 20 years); it is easy to have a good shot occasionally, but difficult to be stable in the long term. It is essential to stay in the market for a long time and focus on long-term growth.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Strongly agree. Investing is like a long-distance race, continuing to stay in the front (such as 3rd or 4th place) will eventually win, because the leaders often make mistakes. This is how index funds are, not the best in a single year, but leading in the long term. Need an investment horizon of 15+ years. The key to persistence is having sufficient cash reserves (especially for retirees, it is recommended to have living expenses for 15+ years) or a continuous work income.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: Started following the teacher last year, investing on my own and encouraging elders (sold insurance and invested). Recently, I have experienced a market decline and am at peace, but the elders are experiencing large fluctuations for the first time (they adopted a Beta 1.2 allocation). Through repeatedly watching videos and communicating, the elders&rsquo; confidence is still stable.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Selling a house has been tortuous: difficulty communicating with my husband (disagreed at first, had disputes), cold market (the central bank fought housing speculation in September, difficult to get loans), price reduction (applied the teacher&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;there is no house that cannot be sold, only a price that cannot be sold&rdquo;) to complete the sale (in February this year). The process was painful (communication, management, market changes, funds stuck, high taxes), and I learned a lesson that I don&rsquo;t want to experience again.</li>
<li>Sharing 3: Currently, half of the investment portfolio is QQQ-like, half is TSMC, and there is also a mortgage line of credit (financial mortgage). My husband wants to use this line of credit to increase positions when the market falls (TSMC?), but hesitates and is afraid in the middle of the actual fall (soft-handed, unable to do it). This decline allowed him to experience his true risk tolerance. My husband did not accept the full QQQ allocation before, but now he has some experience. It verifies the stability of the teacher&rsquo;s asset allocation method.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Appreciate Monmon&rsquo;s peaceful state of mind (a good quality for investors, &ldquo;destiny&rdquo; + &ldquo;luck&rdquo; to meet the teacher). Communicating with family requires patience (it is a 15-30 year undertaking, no rush). The funds from the financial mortgage should be invested as soon as possible (such as 00662), buy blindly, and don&rsquo;t time the market. When investing, consider the overall asset allocation, include the loan amount in the total asset calculation, and ensure that the total Beta value is within the desired range (such as about 0.7, that is, maintaining an overall ratio of about 70/30), rather than investing all the borrowed money in high-risk assets. It is recommended to keep at least 30% cash (can be 4:1:5 or 5:1:4, Beta 0.6 or 0.7). This decline is a touchstone for risk tolerance, proving the necessity of conservative allocation. Even if young and have a job, 30% cash is also recommended.</li>

<li>Sharing: The situation is similar to Monmon&rsquo;s. Both myself and the elders invested in 00662/00670L, using Beta 1.2 (4:4:2, that is, 40% 00662, 40% 00670L, 20% cash/00865B) allocation. I can bear the recent fluctuations (the government is quite amazing), but I am not sure whether the elders (who have not watched YouTube, have no financial common sense, but believe and invest) can bear greater future declines (such as 40-80%). Continuously accompany the elders and give them confidence. The elders have a good mentality so far.</li>
<li>Question: If I want to reduce the Beta for the elders, when and how should I operate?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: It is generally recommended now that the Beta should not exceed 1.0 (such as 70/30). For an existing allocation of 1.2, it is recommended to evaluate it at the end of each year: if the market rises (such as 00662 returning to the level at the beginning of the year or higher), you can sell part of the leveraged position (00670L) and transfer the funds to cash (00865B), so that the cash ratio is adjusted to 30% or higher. If the market is down at the end of the year, then do not move. The goal is to gradually reduce the Beta to below 1.0. Before that, there is no need to consider complicated rebalancing strategies. Don&rsquo;t operate too frequently (once a year) to avoid increasing the elders&rsquo; anxiety (they may secretly look at the APP).</li>

<li>Question 1: Investing in QQQ in Canada, the teacher recommends QQC, etc., and mentions avoiding Hedged funds? It seems that most Canadian versions are Hedged? Which one should I choose? (Previously confused HXQ/HSQ).
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Recommend HXQ.t because it does not pay dividends, making tax treatment simpler. If you already hold QQC.to or ZQQ, there is no need to sell it, and new investments can be bought in HXQ.t. It is also acceptable if only Hedged versions are available locally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Please explain the asset allocation ratio (such as 70/30, 4:4:2). Time is limited (working, back problems requiring exercise, blood sugar problems), it is difficult to find specific content in videos, and listening to Clubhouse is also time-consuming.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: (Emphasizing the importance of learning, earning money from work only accounts for a small part of a lifetime of wealth, so you should spend time learning about investment) For ordinary investors working in Canada, the simplest allocation is: 70% HXQ.t + 30% cash/money market fund (Money Market). Check and adjust annually (sell the ones that have risen more to supplement cash, or use cash to buy the ones that have fallen more) to maintain this ratio.</li>
<li>(Nibalao Supplement): Canadian local stock dividends have tax advantages, while US-sourced dividends (such as QQC) are taxed (I don&rsquo;t know how much, but higher than Canadian stock taxes). I agree with the teacher&rsquo;s point of view: focus on investment returns is higher than focusing on work.</li>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Reiterating the advantage of HXQ.t not paying dividends. Canadian funds seem to be performing well, possibly because better compounding due to not paying dividends.</li>

<li>Sharing: Detailed comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin/cryptocurrencies and QQQ, based on his personal experience in the blockchain industry (entered the industry in 2017, experienced the blockchain/cryptocurrency community, ICO explosion, 2018 bear market):
<ul>
<li>Storage Security: BTC requires self-management of private keys/hardware wallets (cold wallets), which are easy to lose or damage, high risk; QQQ is托管ed by brokers, which is safe.</li>
<li>Transaction Security: BTC is vulnerable to hacker attacks, phishing, and platform crashes; QQQ is protected by regulations.</li>
<li>Staking/Liquidity: BTC lacks standardized and safe staking channels (DeFi is high risk); QQQ can be easily staked and borrowed (pledged) through brokers without selling.</li>
<li>Taxes: Selling BTC requires capital gains tax; holding QQQ for a long time and using pledges can avoid/defer taxes.</li>
<li>Legality: BTC has legal risks in China (trading and mining are illegal), and cashing out may be frozen; QQQ (and QDII 513100/513300) are legal and compliant.</li>
<li>Volatility/Risk: BTC is extremely volatile (short-term drops of 50-80% are common, such as an 85% drop in 2018), and ordinary people cannot withstand the mental stress; QQQ has a much lower frequency of large fluctuations.</li>
<li>Liquidity: The actual circulating volume of BTC is limited (locked by large holders, lost coins), which is not as high as the global liquidity of QQQ.</li>
<li>Practicality: Not detailed.</li>
<li>Future Returns: BTC has a high market value (nearly 2 trillion US dollars, comparable to top technology companies), and the possibility of super high multiple growth in the future is reduced (even if it rises to 200,000 US dollars/coin, it is only 2-3 times), and the rate of return may tend to be stable, lower than QQQ.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Cryptocurrencies are &ldquo;demons and ghosts,&rdquo; not suitable for ordinary investors, highly tempting but extremely risky.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>James&rsquo; Comment: Completely agree, cryptocurrencies should not be touched. Shared cases of others losing huge amounts of Bitcoin (equivalent to 15 million US dollars) due to unfamiliarity with cross-chain transfer rules (such as transferring between different chains or exchanges that do not support the target chain), emphasizing its complexity and risk (may be a technical problem or fraud).</li>

<li><strong>File Access</strong>: In areas with limited Google service, you can download the files and open them with local software (such as Excel).</li>
<li><strong>00864B Taxes</strong>: According to Angela&rsquo;s feedback, it is overseas income, which is tax-free if it is less than 1 million Taiwan dollars (or other high limit such as 7.5 million) per year, and is exempt from the second-generation supplementary health insurance premium. The main problem becomes the trouble of manual reinvestment. You need a principal of 25 million to possibly exceed 1 million in interest.</li>
<li><strong>AI Link</strong>: Confirmed that the latest link has been provided.</li>
<li><strong>Buying QQQ in China</strong>: Through QDII funds, such as 513100, 513300. See page 10 of the lecture notes.</li>
<li><strong>Conflicting Ideas Between Spouses</strong>: Patience, use your own controllable funds to set an example. Sometimes even if you prove it, the other person does not recognize it (&ldquo;past performance does not represent the future&rdquo;), it depends on fate (destiny).</li>
<li><strong>Technical Analysis/Prediction</strong>: The teacher does not make predictions (when will it bottom out, will there be a recession or crash).</li>
<li><strong>Robert Kiyosaki</strong>: The teacher is critical of him (&ldquo;he will go bankrupt&rdquo;).</li>
<li><strong>Trump Policy</strong>: No need to pay attention, high uncertainty, just &ldquo;drizzle,&rdquo; impossible to have zero income tax. In the long run, US taxes may increase to deal with the deficit. Do not make decisions based on unconfirmed conclusions.</li>
<li><strong>Mean Reversion</strong>: There is no simple mean reversion in the stock market. The growth of high-tech companies (such as TSMC) will not revert to traditional industries (such as China Steel, Formosa Plastics). Those who think it will revert are &ldquo;bookworms.&rdquo; Value stocks (such as Starbucks, McDonald&rsquo;s) also perform differently.</li>
<li><strong>442 Allocation</strong>: Not recommended for office workers, it is too risky. Those who have already used it should handle it according to the MM case.</li>
<li><strong>Investment vs Speculation</strong>: The teacher does not agree with the statement that &ldquo;all investments are speculation.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>12-Year Certificates of Deposit vs Compounding</strong>: 00865B/VOO etc. are compounded.</li>
<li><strong>AI Asset Allocation Advice</strong>: May be &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; due to questioning methods or AI model understanding deviations.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The market is always fluctuating, the constant in the market is fluctuation, so fluctuation is certain to happen in the market, so you don&rsquo;t need to analyze where the fluctuation comes from&hellip; You see everyone talking so eloquently, in fact, he doesn&rsquo;t even know what he is talking about&hellip;
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: James emphasized the normality and unpredictability of market fluctuations, advising investors not to waste time analyzing the causes of short-term fluctuations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investment is buying with the intention of never selling, this is investment. Buying with the intention of selling at a high point is called speculation.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: James clearly distinguished the core criteria of investment and speculation: whether the purpose is to hold for the long term.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Making a decision about all investment and financial life is very simple, which is long-term, simple and effective&hellip; Convenience is a value. No trouble is a value.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: When comparing 00864B and 00865B, James emphasized that choosing an investment method that is simpler and less troublesome in the long run has value in itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to risk the money you need for the money you don&rsquo;t need.
&ndash; James (quoting/paraphrasing Buffett&rsquo;s idea)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: Explained why even if it is judged that the market may rise, you should keep enough cash buffer (the money you need) and should not take too much risk for additional, potentially unnecessary returns (the money you don&rsquo;t need).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Later you will find that when humans develop to the extreme, food, clothing, housing, and transportation are all free, all free&hellip; Then what does it mean to be alive?&hellip; But what is the meaning of a dog? This may be the question that the last 80% of people have to think about.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: When fantasizing about the future when AI is extremely developed, James raised the question of the profound crisis of existential meaning that humans (especially the majority who do not need to work) will face after material needs are completely satisfied.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest risk comes from [missing] the market&hellip; Focus on long-term returns, not this short-term [fluctuation].
&ndash; Yao</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: Sharing the profound experience after reviewing the teacher&rsquo;s teachings when the market information is chaotic, emphasizing the importance of being in the market for a long time and focusing on long-term goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to be the first every time, we only want to be the third or fourth every time&hellip; Over the long term, we will be the first.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: Using the analogy of racing to explain the logic of index investing: not pursuing short-term leadership, relying on continuous and steady performance, and ultimately winning in the long cycle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no house that cannot be sold, only a price that cannot be sold.
&ndash; Monmon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: Sharing the experience of selling a house, mentioning that applying this point of view ultimately successfully sold the property.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should put your focus on investing, and the return is definitely much higher than if you put your focus on working.
&ndash; Nibalao</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: When discussing that students do not have time to learn about investment, this student emphasized that based on their own experience, the long-term return of putting energy into investment learning far exceeds that of putting it into work itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Cryptocurrencies] are one of the demons and ghosts&hellip; The future return of Bitcoin may tend to be stable, and the teacher also mentioned this issue before.
&ndash; Jason</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context: Based on industry experience and risk analysis, the student qualified cryptocurrencies as a high-risk category unsuitable for ordinary investors, and pointed out that its future return may not be as good as index funds.</p>

<p>This Clubhouse episode was rich and insightful, ranging from the macro market philosophy (fluctuation is normal, long-term perspective, optimistic mentality), AI&rsquo;s disruptive vision of the future (productivity, social structure, meaning of life), to the micro investment practice (ETF selection such as 00865B vs 00864B, Canadian HXQ.t, asset allocation principles such as 70/30, Beta management, risk awareness), all detailed explanations and discussions were provided. The core information is still focused on: adhering to long-term holding of high-quality index funds (especially the Nasdaq 100), understanding and accepting market fluctuations, maintaining rationality and patience, using time compounding, and conducting sound asset allocation according to personal risk tolerance (emphasizing the importance of at least 30% cash), and being vigilant about market noise and high-risk speculative products (such as cryptocurrencies). The Q&amp;A session answered in detail the specific questions encountered by students in different countries, different stages, and different product selections, and emphasized the importance of continuous learning of investment knowledge. Finally, it was reminded again that the Clubhouse will be suspended for the next two weeks.</p>

<p>This episode focuses on the mindset and strategies that investors should adopt in the context of current market volatility and volatile international situations. James emphasizes that for long-term investors, short-term market fluctuations, macroeconomic conditions, and even wars should not be of excessive concern. The core strategy should be to insist on buying high-quality index funds (such as Nasdaq 100 QQQ) and holding them for the long term, never selling. At the same time, he shares an updated Excel financial simulation tool, discusses pre-retirement withdrawal strategies, leverage management, the significant advantages of early Roth conversion, and how to build a strong investment psychology to cope with external pressure and complex information.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore the Noise, Keep Buying:</strong> Macro factors such as market volatility, international situations, tariff wars, trade wars, hot wars, and cold wars have little to do with long-term investing. Investors cannot and do not need to predict or respond to them. Just keep buying index funds (QQQ) and holding them for the long term.</li>
<li><strong>Halving is Inevitable:</strong> In the long-term investment process, a 50% or even greater reduction in assets is an inevitable event, not a matter of probability, but a certainty. Investors need to be psychologically prepared and ensure that they can still &ldquo;survive&rdquo; in this situation. Ask yourself every day: &ldquo;If the market halves again, can I still hold on?&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Long-Termism and Optimistic Mindset:</strong> Investing requires patience, and wealth is worth waiting for. The market always goes up in the long run. Investors should always be extremely optimistic, even if the market drops 80%, because the decline is part of the investment process, and the future is always bright. Buying is for future gains, not for leaving the market out of fear of future declines.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Origin and Background of the Problem:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some students reported problems with the old Excel version: 1) Increasing the spending ratio may actually reduce the final assets; 2) After a significant increase in assets (such as from 1 million to 4 million), spending directly at 2% of the new assets (i.e., 80,000) failed the stress test when simulating the 2000 tech bubble burst.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Main Updates and Usage Suggestions:</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Separating Spending and Rebalancing Ratios:</strong> Corrected the error of linking the spending ratio with the smart rebalancing ratio. The new version allows independent settings. It is recommended that the smart rebalancing ratio remain at 2% or be adjusted according to individual risk tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>New Strategy for Increasing Spending After Asset Growth (0.8% Rule):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simulation Conclusion:</strong> If assets increase significantly (such as from 1 million to 4.6 million, net worth 3.8 million, and borrowing 780,000 accounting for 17% of total assets), spending directly at 2% of the new assets (80,000/year) is too risky.</li>
<li><strong>Safety Recommendation:</strong> When assets have increased by more than <strong>2.5 times</strong> and the pledged loan ratio is controlled within <strong>20%</strong>, consider increasing the annual spending to <strong>0.7% or 0.8% of the new total assets</strong>. For example, assets of 4.6 million can spend about 36,800/year (4.6 million * 0.8%). After this adjustment, even if you encounter a market shock similar to 2000, you can maintain a sufficient margin of safety. This means that if assets grow 2.5 times, the annual spending can safely increase by about 2.2 times.</li>
<li><strong>Operation Guide (Using the &ldquo;Practice Version&rdquo; Excel):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Enter &ldquo;Scenario Nine&rdquo; (applicable to situations where you have started pledged borrowing and spending).</li>
<li>Modify the &ldquo;Amount Already Borrowed&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo; or &ldquo;Scenario Eight Nine Information&rdquo; area in the front of the table (<strong>do not directly change the S2 cell inside Excel, go to the overview page in front to change it</strong>).</li>
<li>Return to the scenario nine simulation page and modify the initial asset allocation ratio (such as QQQ 33%, QLD/Leverage 45%, Cash 22%).</li>
<li>Adjust the &ldquo;Borrowing Expenses&rdquo; percentage (located in column T, such as changing to 0.8 or 0.7).</li>
<li>Adjust the &ldquo;Borrowing Interest&rdquo; according to the actual situation (cell S5, such as setting it to 3% for Taiwan).</li>
<li>Observe the &ldquo;Minimum Maintenance Rate&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Minimum Equity Ratio&rdquo;) in the results and ensure that it is higher than your set safety threshold (such as 150% or 160%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cash Interest Assumption:</strong> When calculating the compound interest on the Cash portion in Excel, the interest rate used is half of the borrowing rate (S5) (i.e., <code>S5/2/12</code> calculated monthly). This is based on the conservative assumption that the deposit rate is usually lower than the borrowing rate and does not need to be modified.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Version Description:</strong> Provides &ldquo;Easy Version&rdquo; (only needs to fill in the initial total assets, smart rebalancing %, and annual spending %) and &ldquo;Practice Version&rdquo; (allows you to modify more detailed parameters inside Excel, such as initial allocation ratio, profit transfer ratio, initial borrowing ratio/amount, withholding cash ratio, etc.). To perform detailed simulations and parameter adjustments, you need to use the &ldquo;Practice Version.&rdquo;</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario Analysis:</strong> Compare a couple aged 50 with 2 million in Traditional IRA, expected return of 14%, and tax rate of 24%, under three different Roth conversion strategies for the long term (to age 100).
<ul>
<li>Scenario 1: No conversion, relying on RMD. The final assets are approximately <strong>330 million</strong>.</li>
<li>Scenario 2: Work until age 56 and then start converting. The final assets are approximately <strong>350 million</strong>.</li>
<li>Scenario 3: Retire immediately at age 50 and start converting. The final assets are as high as <strong>780 million</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Core Conclusion:</strong> Retiring 6 years early to perform Roth conversion, utilizing the low tax bracket window in the early stage of retirement, can bring more than <strong>300 million USD</strong> in additional wealth. Even for high-income earners (assuming a conversion tax rate of 40%), it takes an additional 9-10 years of work to make up for the huge opportunity cost of not converting early. <strong>It is strongly recommended that those who meet the conditions plan and execute Roth conversion as soon as possible.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Make Good Use of Financial Tools (Transmissive Power):</strong> Specifically pointed out that Taiwan&rsquo;s low interest rate environment provides investors with favorable conditions to use borrowing (pledged loans, etc.) to amplify investment returns (transmissive power).</li>
<li><strong>Bank Perspective and Customer Relationships:</strong> Banks view deposits as liabilities and loans as assets. They are happy to see customers borrow and pay interest on time. Large borrowing customers are VIPs of the bank and enjoy preferential treatment; ordinary depositors need to go through regular procedures.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth Circulation Mechanism:</strong> Commercial banks play an intermediary role in the capitalist system, transferring the idle funds (deposits) of risk-averse/non-investors to investors (borrowers) who are willing to take risks and know how to use funds, and earn interest spreads from them. Understanding this mechanism helps investors use leverage more confidently.</li>

<li><strong>Self-Belief:</strong> First of all, you must be firm in your investment philosophy and understand that volatility is a normal process.</li>
<li><strong>Shielding and Transcendence:</strong> Practice from the realm of &ldquo;not listening, not seeing, does not exist&rdquo; to &ldquo;both seeing and listening but also does not exist,&rdquo; that is, the inner self is not disturbed by external words.</li>
<li><strong>Positive Attitude:</strong> Show confidence and a good state to the outside world (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, no problem, the market will rise&rdquo;).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decluttering and Value Ordering (Refer to Video 00351 &ldquo;Enlightenment&rdquo;):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Life should be simplified, and clarifying what you &ldquo;don&rsquo;t want&rdquo; is more important than what you &ldquo;want.&rdquo; Reducing unnecessary material pursuits and social relationships can bring more freedom and focus.</li>
<li>Reflect on the core values of life, such as &ldquo;relationships,&rdquo; &ldquo;sense of contribution,&rdquo; &ldquo;health,&rdquo; and &ldquo;soul&rdquo; shared by students, and work is only a part of it.</li>
<li>Get rid of the shackles of seeking external recognition (refer to &ldquo;The Courage to be Disliked&rdquo;).</li>

<li><strong>Share:</strong> Taiwanese firefighter, 40 years old, new investor (started in February), adopting a 442 allocation (40% QQQ, 40% leverage, 20% cash), investing approximately 6 million. Recently experienced a large single-day drop of 28% in the leveraged portion, but stated that they could withstand it. Few friends shared the same philosophy. Believes that never selling can achieve financial freedom.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Comments:</strong> Thank you for sharing. The 442 allocation is more aggressive, and this decline is a good stress test. Reminded that firefighting work is physically demanding, and investment should focus more on stability. Suggested adjusting the allocation according to their own comfort level, such as 433 or more conservative 424 or even 505. The primary goal of asset allocation is to make yourself &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; and able to hold it for the long term. Cash is the key to &ldquo;surviving.&rdquo; When facing external doubts, maintaining a strong inner self and confidence is the most important.</li>

<li><strong>Life Reflections:</strong> Reviewing last week&rsquo;s homework, combined with &ldquo;How Will You Measure Your Life?&rdquo; and Brian Dyson&rsquo;s five-ball theory, clarified that the second value of life is &ldquo;relationships,&rdquo; &ldquo;sense of contribution,&rdquo; and &ldquo;treating nature well&rdquo;; emphasized the irreplaceability of health, family, friendship, and soul; the current most wanted to get rid of is &ldquo;seeking recognition from others&rdquo;; believed that life regrets often stem from &ldquo;things not done.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Origin of Excel Questions:</strong> Deeply studied Excel and discovered problems due to concerns about smart rebalancing causing Beta to continue to rise (such as &gt;1.2) and wanting to increase living expenses (at 2% of new assets) after asset growth.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Can leveraged ETFs (such as 00670L) commonly used by Taiwanese investors be included in the Excel model to calculate the maintenance rate (market value)? If included, even with a higher Beta (such as 1.24), it seems that a 433 allocation can pass the test.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Philosophy of Life:</strong> Appreciated the in-depth thinking. Emphasized the importance of &ldquo;decluttering&rdquo; and clarifying &ldquo;what not to want.&rdquo; Agreed that there is no need for others to recognize, and shared that they value their relationship with their children the most. Recommended video 00351 &ldquo;Enlightenment.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Excel and Taiwan Applications:</strong> Theoretically, the market value of leveraged ETFs can be included in the maintenance rate calculation. The existing model is based on the US situation and is conservative (high interest rate assumptions, not explicitly including the market value of leverage), aimed at being universal and safe. Taiwanese investors can take advantage of the no capital gains tax (easy to reduce leverage) and lower interest rates, and modify Excel themselves (such as changing the interest rate and adjusting the maintenance rate formula) to better fit reality. If the model can pass, it is usually easier in Taiwan. Thanked them for their question, which prompted the optimization of the &ldquo;how to increase spending after asset growth&rdquo; strategy (0.7%-0.8% rule or reducing leverage).</li>

<li><strong>Question:</strong> Observed that the recovery time of historical bear markets seems to be shortening. Combined with the evolution of US financial policies (QE, pandemic response, etc.), does it mean that the government&rsquo;s control efficiency has improved and the market recovery is accelerating?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Agreed with the observation. With the accumulation of financial theory and practical experience, policy tools are more effective, and the ability to respond to known crises has indeed increased, shortening the recovery period. But the real risk lies in <strong>unknown, unprecedented crises</strong>. There is no need to worry too much about known patterns, and be optimistic about the future but have risk awareness.</li>

<li><strong>Share:</strong> 433 allocation is already All in. Although they thought they were prepared, when actually facing the decline, it was difficult to bear the pressure from their parents&rsquo; &ldquo;caring&rdquo; worries, and they were even afraid to tell them about the losses. Glad that this decline occurred when the invested proportion was not yet high.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How to cope with this kind of caring pressure from relatives and friends (especially parents)? (Especially for office workers who cannot physically avoid it like retirees).
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Cannot control others, only cultivate the inner self. From shielding information (&ldquo;not listening, not seeing, does not exist&rdquo;) to the inner self not being disturbed (&ldquo;both seeing and listening but also does not exist&rdquo;). The key is to have firm self-belief, understand the current situation, and show confidence to the outside world (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine&rdquo;). The decline is the norm for investing, or a good opportunity to rebalance. When the inner self is strong enough to realize a certain illusion of the external world, its influence can be reduced.</li>

<li><strong>Question:</strong> Expressed concerns about the US&rsquo;s leading position in technology, listed multiple negative information (loss of scientists, tightening of visas, damage to funding/independence of research institutions, anti-vaccine stance of the Minister of Health and public health incidents), and asked about the impact of the US losing its position as a technology center on QQQ investment and whether it is necessary to adjust the strategy.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Macro Level:</strong> Refer to video 00430C. Admitted that global competition is intensifying, but the US has not declined, and the foundation of technological strength remains. The US democratic system has resilience and self-correcting ability, and there is no need to be overly pessimistic due to short-term policies or personnel changes.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Indicators:</strong> The criteria for judgment is the composition of the top ten technology companies in the world by market value. If it is still dominated by the United States, then there is no need to change the strategy. If the future pattern changes significantly (such as non-US companies accounting for more than half), consider adjusting the proportion accordingly. Unlikely to happen within 50 years.</li>
<li><strong>Specific Concerns:</strong> Much information may be amplified or biased (information cocoon effect). Believe in the basic integrity system and institutional resilience of American society. Individual incidents (such as anti-vaccine rhetoric, measles outbreaks), while worrying, are unlikely to subvert the entire system. Stay focused, but don&rsquo;t panic, and focus on verifiable facts.</li>

<li><strong>Question:</strong> Why is the annual borrowing rate (S5) divided by 2 in the monthly compound interest calculation of the cash portion in the Excel practice version?
<ul>
<li><strong>James/慶 (Qing) Response:</strong> This is the design assumption of the model: The <strong>deposit rate</strong> (cash yield) is set to half of the <strong>borrowing rate</strong>. This is a simplified, conservative estimate that reflects the reality of the bank&rsquo;s deposit and loan interest rate spread. The formula <code>principal * (1 + S5/2/12)</code> is correct, reflecting this safety margin, and does not need to be modified.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Market volatility, international situations, trade wars, hot and cold wars&hellip; have nothing to do with our investment, just buy, don&rsquo;t sell. Long-term is investment.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Emphasizes that long-term investment should focus on holding high-quality assets, ignoring short-term market noise and macro events.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will definitely encounter several opportunities for asset depreciation of 50% in the market, this is not a probability problem, this is a certainty.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Reminds investors that a significant market correction is an inevitable part of long-term investment and that they need to be psychologically and financially prepared for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asset allocation is not done for performance, asset allocation is done for your comfort.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Explains that the primary goal of asset allocation (especially the proportion of cash holdings) is to ensure that investors can hold it with peace of mind and get through the cycle, rather than simply pursuing the highest returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commercial banks are intermediaries that transfer the money of the poor to the rich for use, and this revolving door takes place in banks. This is the reason why the capitalist system makes the poor poorer and the rich richer.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Reveals the core role of the modern banking system in capital flow and its impact on the wealth distribution pattern.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who borrow money are VIPs&hellip; those who don&rsquo;t have much money and don&rsquo;t borrow money, please go to the counter to draw a number and line up.
&ndash; James (quoting student Benson&rsquo;s observation)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Vividly compares the vast difference in the way banks treat large borrowing customers and ordinary depositors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You push out all the things you don&rsquo;t want first&hellip; then what are the things you have left that you want? It&rsquo;s very little&hellip; the less you want, the less homework you have.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Applies the concept of &ldquo;decluttering&rdquo; to life planning, advocating that by reducing desires and unnecessary pursuits, inner freedom and focus can be achieved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are besieged by the network and locked in an information prison, you can&rsquo;t break out&hellip; all our thoughts are not our thoughts&hellip; we are all parrots.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Deeply warns of the erosion of individual cognition and independent thinking ability by &ldquo;information cocoons,&rdquo; calling for vigilance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both seeing and listening but also does not exist.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Describes an advanced state of psychological practice, where even when exposed to negative or disturbing information, the inner self can remain calm and unaffected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things that have happened in the past are less worried about, we are worried about things that have never happened before.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Distinguishes between known and unknown risks, pointing out that historical experience helps to deal with recurring crises, but the real challenge lies in dealing with new, unknown shocks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you retire six years early (to perform Roth conversion), you will be short of 300 million (USD).
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Based on simulation calculation results, strongly emphasizes the huge long-term wealth effect that can be brought about by using the low tax rate window to convert Roth IRA/401k as early as possible.</p>

<p>This lecture, against the background of increased market volatility, strengthened the core concept of long-term investment: ignore the noise and insist on holding high-quality index funds (QQQ). James not only updated and explained in detail the important financial planning tool Excel model (especially the adjustment of withdrawal strategies after asset growth), but also persuasively demonstrated the amazing value of doing Roth conversion as early as possible. At a deeper level, the course focused on the construction of investment psychology, discussed how to understand and use financial system rules, how to cope with external pressure (worries from relatives and friends, social information) with a strong inner self, and especially emphasized the extreme importance of maintaining independent thinking and being wary of &ldquo;information cocoons&rdquo; in the era of information explosion. The ultimate goal is to help investors cultivate both their inner skills and achieve a double improvement in cognition and mindset on the road to pursuing financial freedom.</p>

      <description>In this episode, James emphasizes that in any market environment, the primary consideration for investing is having sufficient cash reserves, followed by holding index funds for the long term. He discusses risk tolerance, asset allocation models (such as 433 and 424), the principles for using leveraged funds, and caution regarding paid groups and conflicts of interest. Students share their experiences and questions regarding market volatility, tax planning, retirement preparation, and more.</description>

<p>The core viewpoint of this episode emphasizes that investment decisions should be <strong>independent of market volatility</strong>, with <strong>sufficient cash reserves</strong> serving as the first step and cornerstone of investment planning. After determining the cash level based on individual risk tolerance and living needs, then proceed with long-term (15+ years) investment in index funds (especially the Nasdaq 100). Beta is a result of asset allocation, not the starting point. At the same time, be wary of various risks in investment, especially cognitive risks and behavioral biases, and remain vigilant about conflicts of interest in financial services.</p>

<li><strong>Focus on Doing the Right Things:</strong> The core is &ldquo;Han Xin Counts Soldiers&rdquo; (i.e., using affordable and safe borrowing, such as mortgages and credit lines, for investment), putting borrowed money into the market, but with sufficient cash reserves.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Targets:</strong> Only invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (such as QQQ, 00662, 513100, etc.), as it represents human growth and innovation and has a self-evolving mechanism of survival of the fittest. Related materials are linked on page 10 of the handout. It is mentioned that HXQ and other Nasdaq 100-based funds may outperform QQQ in certain periods.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Holding:</strong> Holding for 15+ years after purchase is key, &ldquo;never selling.&rdquo; Only inaction can lead to wealth, not frequent trading.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Optimistic:</strong> Investment is based on confidence in the long-term development of humanity.</li>

<li><strong>433 (Beta 1.0):</strong> 40% Index + 30% Leverage + 30% Cash. Requires 30% Cash &gt; Emergency Fund (e.g., NT$400,000), requiring total assets of NT$1.33 million to implement.</li>
<li><strong>424 (Beta 0.8):</strong> 40% Index + 20% Leverage + 40% Cash. Requires 40% Cash &gt; Emergency Fund (e.g., NT$400,000), requiring total assets of NT$1 million to implement. Illustrates that reducing Beta can lower the funding threshold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>High-Net-Worth Individuals:</strong> The principle is the same, determine the cash ratio according to personal comfort (potentially millions of RMB or hundreds of thousands of USD).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Beta is the Result, Not the Goal:</strong> First determine cash needs and risk tolerance, naturally forming the allocation ratio, and finally calculate the Beta value as a measurement tool. Don&rsquo;t set a target Beta from the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Allocation Irrelevant Factors:</strong> Asset allocation is <strong>unrelated</strong> to age, fund size, or market level, only related to how to prevent accidents and how much accident can be tolerated.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Tolerance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Young people have less experience, so risk tolerance may not be high, and should not blindly pursue high Beta (e.g., 442).</li>
<li>Wealthy people are usually more conservative, pursuing stability rather than extreme returns (Beta 0.5 may be sufficient).</li>
<li>Conclusion: Taking risks beyond your tolerance is foolish. Investment is like eating spicy food, do what you can handle.</li>
<li>Recommendation: Start conservatively. If you believe you can tolerate Beta 1.2, start with 1.0; if you believe you can tolerate 1.0, start with 0.8.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Leveraged Fund Usage Principles:</strong> The ratio of leveraged funds should not exceed the ratio of cash or the ratio of the original fund. This suggests that a 442 allocation (40% Index + 40% Leverage + 20% Cash) is not suitable for most people.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral Biases:</strong> Retail investors often feel sad when the market falls (regret buying early) and also sad when the market rises (regret not going all-in). The correct allocation should achieve &ldquo;happy when it rises, comfortable when it falls,&rdquo; maintaining &ldquo;immovability.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Individual Stock Risk:</strong> No company lasts forever (examples: Intel, Kodak, Blackberry), individual stock risk is high. Index funds mitigate individual stock risk through a mechanism of survival of the fittest.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing Risk:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safe Borrowing:</strong> Mortgages, credit lines (Han Xin Counts Soldiers), assuming income can cover monthly payments, unrelated to market fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Dangerous Borrowing:</strong> Margin trading, stock-pledged reinvestment. Market declines can lead to forced liquidation or even bankruptcy. <strong>These operations are strictly prohibited.</strong></li>
<li>James&rsquo;s pledge loan: Based on holding cash far exceeding debt, ensuring absolute security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Specific Funds Use Risk:</strong> Money earmarked for short-term use (e.g., down payment on a house) within a short period (e.g., 3 years) <strong>absolutely cannot</strong> be invested in the stock market. Someone recently defaulted because of this.</li>
<li><strong>Tax Risk:</strong> Tax planning is very important and can affect significant wealth. Rules need to be carefully studied (e.g., the application of the U.S. Wash Sale Rule across accounts).</li>
<li><strong>Spending Ability Mindset:</strong> True &ldquo;affordability&rdquo; means being able to easily repurchase an item if it breaks down, as in James&rsquo;s example of replacing a juicer. Large expenditures (e.g., buying a house) should also have this mindset, otherwise the risk is too high.</li>

<ol>
<li>Observed that regardless of wealth, some people are keen on short-term trading, possibly due to addictive pleasure or a sense of accomplishment. Poor people may say they need quick returns, while rich people may enjoy the process.</li>
<li>Emphasized the strict prohibition of margin trading or stock-pledged reinvestment. Recently, with the market decline, someone was forced to liquidate and even became indebted because of it. Compared this to his own use of credit lines/mortgages for investment, stating that as long as he can afford the monthly payments, the market decline does not affect his survival.</li>

<li>Has reached the retirement goal (50x annual expenses), but his current salary is equivalent to 6% of total assets.

Between 433 (30% cash + 2% withdrawal) and 442 (20% cash + no withdrawal), how to further think about the choice from the perspective of safety and applicability?</li>
<li>(Implicit question) Should he continue working for a sense of accomplishment, or retire early?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Regarding Purchasing the Car:</strong> Praised his use of &ldquo;non-own funds&rdquo; for consumption, pointing out that being able to borrow money is itself a manifestation of wealth, the key is controllable risk (sufficient cash).</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Retirement Choices:</strong> This is a classic question. Cited another case to illustrate that early retirement may bring huge benefits due to tax planning (such as Roth conversions). Suggested that Rui reflect: if work had no salary or recognition, would he still want to go? The value of work may change with stage, and there may be new pursuits in the future. Looking back from age 90, would he regret working several more decades? With financial freedom, the work mentality can be more relaxed.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding 433 vs 442 Safety:</strong> Assuming the market goes to zero, which is safer? The answer is the one with a higher cash ratio (433 has 30% cash, 442 has only 20%).</li>

<li>Question: Regarding whether the interest on the U.S. Pledged Asset Line (PAL, pledge loan) can be tax-deductible, and how to operate? Feels that the rules are complex and there are many restrictions.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: The money borrowed from PAL is mainly used for consumption, not reinvestment. The issue of interest tax deduction is complicated and may require adjusting the type of capital gains (e.g., converting long-term to short-term), relying on accountant operations. James himself does not pay attention to this operation because his strategy is to hold a lot of cash, making interest income far exceed PAL interest expenses, and PAL interest is close to zero. The more fundamental strategy is to achieve &ldquo;zero income, zero capital gains,&rdquo; so there is no need to consider tax deduction.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Revealed an American tax trap: the Wash Sale Rule may apply to all accounts (including 401k/IRA and other retirement accounts). If you sell a loss-making asset (such as QQQ) in a taxable account for Tax Loss Harvesting (TLH) and automatically buy a similar asset (such as an SP500 index fund) in a retirement account at the same time, the loss in the taxable account may be permanently disallowed (because retirement accounts are taxed at ordinary income rates when withdrawn, with no capital gains concept). This is especially important for high-tech employees, as they often hold a large number of RSUs and perform TLH.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: Tax issues are extremely important. Pointed out that TLH itself also has risks, such as the market rebounding after selling, making it impossible to buy back the original asset (QQQ) at an ideal price, or generating new capital gains when buying back. If James himself has no need (such as no capital gains without selling stocks), he tends to let the loss carry forward and deduct $3,000 of ordinary income each year, rather than use it to offset capital gains. However, for Julia, who needs to offset a large amount of RSU capital gains, TLH is a reasonable strategy and needs to be operated carefully. Discussed the problem of high tax rates in California. Re-emphasized the ultimate goal of pursuing a zero-tax state, and the value of tax planning far exceeds the salary itself.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: Asked about the risk of the Pacific War two years ago, at that time the teacher suggested reducing 50% of QQQ. Now that he has adopted the strategy of holding a large amount of cash (such as 433/424), can he withstand this type of risk, insist on holding it and rebalancing at the end of the year, without selling in the middle?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: The evolution of the strategy is because the introduction of leveraged instruments allows holding a large amount of cash more effectively. The core risk management issue is not specific events (wars, disasters, etc.), but <strong>whether it is possible to survive in extreme market conditions (such as closure/deep decline for 10-15 years)</strong>. If cash reserves are sufficient to support such a long time, there is no need to make predictive operations for specific events. Comparing risks: for young people, the risk of carrying a mortgage and facing unemployment + market decline may be more realistic and fatal than the risk of war. Buying a house should be as easy and stress-free as buying slippers to be considered affordable.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Summarized two major investment risks:
<ol>
<li><strong>Choosing the wrong asset:</strong> The market is full of various temptations, choosing a high-quality asset for the long term (such as QQQ) is the foundation. Thanks to the teacher for continuing to emphasize this.</li>
<li><strong>Missing the upside:</strong> Statistics show that missing the 10 days with the biggest market gains (in the past 20 years) will cut total returns in half. These big rally days often occur during periods of extreme panic (such as 2008, 2020). This confirms the importance of the &ldquo;never sell&rdquo; strategy to avoid timing the market.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Comment: Highly Agreed. Defined <strong>the real, permanent loss</strong> as <strong>the returns that should have been earned but were not</strong> (such as missing a 12% rally). Book losses caused by market declines are temporary and will recover. Compared buying QQQ at a high point (540) with buying at a low point (440), the difference in annualized returns after holding for 40 years is extremely small (11.98% vs 12.5%), indicating that the timing of the purchase is not important, but long-term holding is key. Use a long-term perspective (40 years later) to review current decisions.</li>

<li>Question: Approaching retirement, but savings have not reached the 30-50x target. There is a stable high income in the next 5 years, and Pension/Social Security will cover most expenses after retirement. Does not use pledging due to concerns about risk. Can I not retain 20% cash and take a 100% stock holding strategy, relying on future income, emergency fund, and future pledgeable options to accelerate asset growth?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s Response: <strong>No.</strong> Risk tolerance decreases as retirement approaches, the time window is short, and you should be more conservative. Since the Pension already covers most of the expenses, the urgency for asset growth should be reduced. <strong>The most aggressive allocation for retirement or near retirement, without using pledges and without holding leveraged funds, is 80% QQQ + 20% cash.</strong> Pension should be regarded as a stable source of income, and when calculating the total amount of retirement funds required, the <strong>Pension portion should be deducted</strong> from annual expenses first, and then the remaining net expenditure needs should be multiplied by a multiple (such as 30 or 50 times). If you hold leveraged funds, you must sell them and deal with tax issues before retirement.</li>

<li>James&rsquo;s Response: Not recommended. The U.S. market is optimal in terms of innovation, transparency, and long-term risk-reward ratio. Other markets have higher risks and relatively low return potential. Investing in U.S. index funds is sufficient.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The first step in investing is not to say, ah, I come in and start, what should the teacher buy, how much leveraged funds should I buy&hellip; No&hellip; The first thing to invest in is how much cash you need, how much cash you need to keep, this is more important than anything.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Emphasizes the primacy of cash reserves in investment planning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our strategy has nothing to do with market volatility&hellip; What are investment plans or investments supposed to do? It is to be based on your own risk tolerance&hellip; How much cash is appropriate to keep, this is the first step in investing.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Explains the core concept of his investment strategy, which is not affected by short-term market sentiment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beta is naturally formed in the end, not set at the beginning&hellip; So you have to ask the first few questions, how much cash do you keep to feel comfortable&hellip; An accident may come in the next second.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Explains the role of Beta in asset allocation, which is a result, not a goal, emphasizing safety first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Young people should not take risks, because they lack experience, and rich people do not take risks much&hellip; Coming back to the point, taking risks is not very worthwhile, taking risks beyond what you can afford is just very stupid.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Refutes traditional concepts, pointing out that excessive risk-taking is not advisable, regardless of whether you are young or wealthy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t turn your tactics into a strategy&hellip; It seems that the emergency fund should have been so much, but you, ah, it&rsquo;s dropped so much, quickly buy it all in. That turns tactics into a strategy, you can&rsquo;t do that.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: When commenting on student sharing, distinguishes the boundaries between strategic determination and tactical flexibility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What you should look at is not your single stock (referring to leveraged ETFs)&hellip; Drops a lot, you should look at the range of fluctuations in your entire asset&hellip; Don&rsquo;t pay too much attention to the part that is dropping the most.
&ndash; CAD (Student)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Reminds that when holding leveraged ETFs, you should pay attention to the volatility of the overall investment portfolio rather than a single product, to stabilize your mentality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the real risk of the market? The real risk of the market is your investment return, the real risk is the returns that you should have earned but didn&rsquo;t, that you will never earn&hellip; A drop in losses is not a loss.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Redefines investment risk, emphasizing that opportunity cost (missing the upside) is the real permanent loss.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The risk of buying a house is higher than the risk of war&hellip; If you treat buying a house like buying slippers, then you can buy a house.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Responding to questions about geopolitical risks, compared and pointed out that for ordinary people, financial leverage (such as mortgages) may bring more direct and serious risks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t manage your finances and taxes well, you may pay 85% of your assets in taxes in this life, and you actually only get 15%&hellip; Saving taxes can save tens of billions.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: When discussing tax planning, emphasizes its huge impact on long-term wealth accumulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because being poor is also right to do speculation&hellip; So it&rsquo;s also right that most people who speculate are poor&hellip; Many people who speculate don&rsquo;t even know it, they don&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know, which is very strange.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: When discussing speculative psychology with his daughter, reflected on the relationship between poverty and greed, and that speculators often lack self-awareness.</p>

<p>This lecture once again consolidates James&rsquo;s core investment philosophy: <strong>taking sufficient cash reserves as a prerequisite for ultra-long-term (15+ years) holding of the Nasdaq 100 index fund.</strong> It emphasizes the priority of risk management, especially determining the cash ratio based on individual circumstances and building asset allocation based on this, rather than pursuing a specific Beta value or being driven by market sentiment. The differences in risk perception at different life stages and wealth levels were discussed, and the use of high-risk leverage (such as margin trading) for investment was strongly opposed. In addition, practical advice and warnings were shared on tax planning, retirement preparation, financial service selection, and consumption mentality. The Q&amp;A session delved into the specific problems encountered by students in practice, further clarifying strategy details and risk considerations, such as retirement fund calculation, the view on global diversification, and psychological management techniques (focus on overall portfolio rather than local volatility). Overall, this content revolves around the two words <strong>&ldquo;determination&rdquo;</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;safety,&rdquo;</strong> that is, maintaining strategic determination and financial security in a volatile market, and adhering to the correct principles.</p>

<p>The market is always fluctuating; this is normal. Investors should have a long-term perspective, ignoring short-term volatility and market noise (such as international situations, economic analysis, financial reports, etc.). The core strategy is to hold high-quality index funds (such as QQQ) for the long term, and to make reasonable asset allocation (including cash reserves) based on individual risk tolerance, while overcoming the greed and fear of human nature. Learning and building a firm belief are essential.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market volatility is normal</strong>: A 10% market drop is normal, 20% happens about every two or three years, and 50% may happen every five to ten years. This is like the tides, wind, rain, and earthquakes in nature; it&rsquo;s an inevitable natural phenomenon. Don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;this year is different&rdquo;; every year is the same.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of a long-term perspective</strong>: As long as you stay in the market long enough, you will understand that there is nothing new in the market. The core laws of the market are &ldquo;always rising&rdquo; and &ldquo;always fluctuating.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Ignore the noise</strong>: Market fluctuations, international situations, market analysis, financial reports, and economic situations are all irrelevant to the decisions of long-term investors.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended strategy</strong>: Hold the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ) for the long term; it can be bought worldwide. This is the simplest and most effective strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive request</strong>: Hope everyone likes, leaves comments, and most importantly, subscribes on various platforms (Podcast, Bilibili, YouTube).</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning to build belief</strong>: Investing is simple (buy index funds), but there are many external distractions (monsters and ghosts). You need to build firm belief and willpower through learning, so that you will not be easily swayed by other people&rsquo;s opinions.</li>
<li><strong>Overcoming human weaknesses</strong>: Greed and fear are the biggest enemies of investment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Manifestations of greed</strong>: Chasing high when the market rises, thinking that the opportunity to &ldquo;buy the dip&rdquo; has come when the market falls, and using up all cash too early (e.g., constantly adding positions when the market has just fallen 5%-13%).</li>
<li><strong>Manifestations of fear</strong>: Not daring to buy when the market rises, only FOMOing (fear of missing out) All-in when it has risen too much; panicking when the market falls and selling at a loss at the bottom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Importance of cash</strong>: Ample cash is a magic weapon to overcome human nature (especially fear), as important as air. It makes you feel comfortable and secure when the market falls. Don&rsquo;t exhaust your cash when the market just starts to fall.</li>
<li><strong>Living in the present</strong>: Don&rsquo;t dwell on past mistakes (such as losses in real estate investment), don&rsquo;t worry too much about future uncertainties, focus on the present, and do your current investment and learning well.</li>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finding the comfort zone</strong>: Everyone has a different risk tolerance. You need to find your comfortable asset allocation ratio through market fluctuations (such as 442, 433, 523, 514, 505, etc.), and the cash ratio is very important. If you feel uncomfortable when the market falls, you should adjust to a configuration that you can hold with peace of mind during rebounds.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage risk</strong>: Few people can withstand fluctuations of more than 1.2 times Beta. When the market falls, many people will not be able to stand it and reduce leverage. Don&rsquo;t be overconfident in adding leverage when the market is good.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Some people went from 442 to 0.9x leverage or even lower.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rebalancing</strong>: It is recommended to do rebalancing once a year. Only use a small amount of cash (e.g., 2% per year) to buy if the market is down at the end of the year. Don&rsquo;t operate frequently or exhaust your cash due to monthly or short-term declines.</li>
<li><strong>About full-position leverage</strong>: It is not recommended for young people to use &ldquo;full-position two-times leverage,&rdquo; because there will always be a big bubble in life. High leverage may lead to a significant asset drawdown (e.g., falling to 0.1), which is difficult to recover, and you may reach your goal later than with a stable investment.</li>
<li><strong>Tortoise and hare</strong>: A stable configuration (tortoise) will outperform an aggressive high-leverage strategy (hare) in the long run. Even if the Beta is lower than 1, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose of secured borrowing</strong>: The purpose of secured borrowing is not to pursue extreme returns, but to meet living needs or make better configurations while holding high-quality assets for the long term. The risk lies in the ability to repay the principal, not the interest burden.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>US Debt Clock Update</strong>: The website has been updated, adding data such as DoJ Waste Recovery of federal wasted funds and U.S. Hidden Wealth Assets (including gold, minerals, real estate, land, stocks, Recaptured Assets, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>U.S. Balance Sheet</strong> (as of March 27, 2025, approximate numbers):
<ul>
<li>Total Assets: Approximately 168 Trillion (T)</li>
<li>Federal Government Debt (in bond form): Approximately 36 T</li>
<li>Total Liabilities (including credit represented by cash M1/M2, etc.): Approximately 102 T</li>
<li>Annual Income (GDP): Approximately 28 T</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interpretation</strong>: It&rsquo;s like a person having 1.68 million in assets (and the assets are growing at a rate of about 10%), 1.02 million in debt (of which 360,000 is core debt), and an annual salary of 280,000 (which is also growing). The debt is controllable, and the risk of bankruptcy is very low. U.S. dollar cash itself is also a liability, but it will depreciate with inflation, reducing the actual repayment pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Interest problem</strong>: Federal debt interest expenditure is about 1T, which is controllable relative to federal tax revenue (about 4.9T + state tax) and GDP (28T). There is no need to worry too much about the so-called interest exceeding defense spending (about 0.9T), as this comparison is not meaningful.</li>
<li><strong>Clarification of Musk&rsquo;s views</strong>: Musk mainly criticized the <strong>inefficiency and waste</strong> of the U.S. government&rsquo;s spending, rather than the debt itself being unsustainable.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of tariffs</strong>: Raising tariffs essentially shifts costs to consumers, leading to rising prices, which is equivalent to a disguised tax. This is just a different form from directly collecting federal taxes (paying in installments in daily consumption vs. paying once a year). The impact on the overall economy is complex, but for individuals, it may just be &ldquo;shifting from the left pocket to the right pocket.&rdquo;</li>

<li><strong>HSBC Hong Kong Account Opening Experience (Student Sharing)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Threshold: May require assets equivalent to HK$1 million to avoid monthly fees (approximately HK$380).</li>
<li>Transaction fee: Relatively high, but has little impact on long-term holders.</li>
<li>Stock pledge interest rate: HIBOR + 1.2%, currently about 4.92%, which is acceptable.</li>
<li>Suggestion: It is more convenient to sell stocks in other brokerages for cash and transfer them in than to perform complex cross-system transfers. Don&rsquo;t delay important matters for small fees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Canadian Real Estate Investment Issues (Student Sharing)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Non-tax residents face high withholding tax on selling property (35% of the selling price, not the profit), and transaction costs are high (brokerage fees, prepayment penalties, lawyer and accounting fees).</li>
<li>Conclusion: Houses are &ldquo;invisible cages&rdquo; and tools for governments, the financial industry, and capitalism to bind labor. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to sell the house; past investments are sunk costs. James also shared his experience of losing money selling a house in Longtan, Taiwan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Retirement Planning Case (Student Question)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>NT$15 million in funds + NT$5 million in financial-type mortgage.</li>
<li>Suggestion: For the part that needs cash flow, consider buying ETFs such as 0050/0056 that provide dividends, but be aware that their dividends may include principal (selling component stocks).</li>
<li>Investment of NT$15 million: If you don&rsquo;t need to withdraw money from it, you can consider leveraged allocation (such as 433); if you need to withdraw money, you cannot use leverage. Choose the allocation based on the withdrawal rate (the amount needed after deducting Social Security benefits) (e.g., 2% withdrawal with 80/20 QQQ/cash; 3% withdrawal with SPY). The withdrawal rate is key, not the traditional 4% rule.</li>
<li>Core: Any configuration must consider whether you can withstand a 50% market drop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tesla FSD Experience (Student and Teacher Sharing)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>FSD V12 is amazing, close to fully autonomous driving, able to handle complex road conditions (such as San Francisco), and significantly reduces driving stress and fatigue.</li>
<li>FSD has a certain &ldquo;perception&rdquo; ability and can judge the intentions of other vehicles/pedestrians and make intelligent reactions.</li>
<li>Value: The teacher believes that FSD is worth the money (willing to spend $100,000 to buy it), improves safety (saves lives), improves the driving experience (reduces family quarrels), and may even reduce insurance premiums (using Tesla Insurance). Strongly recommends buying a Tesla car with FSD (the new Model Y comes standard). Use the teacher&rsquo;s referral code for discounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Consumption Concepts and Family (Student Question)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Problem: Family members (such as spouses, parents) continue to demand new car replacements and other consumption due to &ldquo;laborer thinking&rdquo; or material needs, which conflicts with their own goals of accumulating wealth, and they feel annoyed.</li>
<li>Teacher&rsquo;s suggestion:
<ul>
<li>Understand the needs and feelings of family members (love what they love).</li>
<li>Learn to &ldquo;consume smartly,&rdquo; using financial tools (such as secured loans, adjusting allocation ratios) to meet some reasonable needs without excessively affecting the growth of core investments. For example, sell 100,000 QQQ, exchange it for 50,000 QLD (keeping some exposure) + 50,000 cash to buy a car.</li>
<li>The goal of capitalists is to make money generate money and ultimately use it to improve the quality of life, not just to save money. Find a balance between accumulation and consumption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Technology Product Consumption</strong>: The teacher shared that buying high-quality displays (Nano-texture display) and AirPods Pro 2 (with hearing aid function, about $249) is to protect health and improve the quality of life. These investments are worthwhile, and financial operations (such as secured loans, credit card rebates reinvestment) can be used to make them feel like &ldquo;no money is spent.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Defining Purchasing Power</strong>: True purchasing power means that when the purchased items (such as houses and cars) are accidentally damaged, you have the ability to easily buy another one without feeling financial pressure or heartache. Otherwise, you are exceeding your consumption capacity.</li>

<li>Sharing: Reviewed his 16-year investment journey: early purchases of 0050/0056 -&gt; chasing biotech stocks (heavy losses) -&gt; starting to invest in U.S. stocks (VOO/VTI/bonds, diversified) after the pandemic -&gt; epiphany after listening to the course, and is now concentrating assets into QQQ. Realized that dividends (0056) are not as good as total return (0050), paying off the mortgage too early was a wrong decision, and the cost of time is terrible.</li>
<li>Question 1: Should asset allocation (such as 442/433) be achieved on all accounts (Taiwan, US Brokerage, IRA, Roth 401k, etc.) as a whole, or should each account follow?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: All accounts should be regarded as a whole for allocation. Leveraged funds (such as QLD) can only be placed in tax-free growth Roth accounts. Cash can be placed in Brokerage or Traditional IRA/401k (doing so can slow down the growth of pre-tax accounts, which is beneficial for future taxes). The final Beta value will be limited by the size of the Roth account. Even if the Beta is lower than 1, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Stability (tortoise) may outperform aggression (hare).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: There are historical contributions in Traditional 401k (mutual funds have been converted to QQQ), and now it is a mix of Roth and Traditional. Should the Traditional portion be converted to Roth?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Whether to convert depends on the amount and current tax rate. If the amount is not large, you can convert it all at once. If the amount is large (e.g., 500,000), in order to avoid high tax burdens, it should be converted over many years. You can use the Investment Calculator to calculate how much amount to convert each year to reduce the Traditional balance to zero within a set period (e.g., 10 years) while controlling the annual tax burden. Fidelity clearly distinguishes the shares of Roth and Traditional internally.</li>

<li>Sharing: Experienced Tesla FSD V12 and felt it was very good. 99% of the journey can be driven automatically, including handling cut-ins, traffic jams, and complex slopes in San Francisco, which greatly improves driving efficiency and comfort. Admired Tesla&rsquo;s technology and efficiency (the AI ​​department has few people but significant results).
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Very much agree. FSD is not just mechanical execution, but can also &ldquo;feel&rdquo; the intentions of other vehicles and pedestrians and make intelligent judgments. FSD greatly reduces driving pressure and improves safety (saves lives). Using FSD also helps reduce the insurance premium for Tesla Insurance. Strongly recommends buying a Tesla with FSD, and stocks can be held through QQQ.</li>

<li>Sharing: Encountered a brokerage that promoted an IPO and realized that it was an interference from &ldquo;monsters and ghosts.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Question: How to deal with close people (parents, spouses, children) who continue to hold &ldquo;laborer thinking&rdquo; and constantly demand material consumption (such as changing to a new car), which conflicts with their own wealth accumulation philosophy and feels annoyed and pressured? Is there a good way to deal with it?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Understanding and love</strong>: Understand the needs of family members and love them (love what they love). Meeting reasonable needs is part of maintaining family harmony.</li>
<li><strong>Smart consumption</strong>: Capitalists don&rsquo;t not consume, but consume smartly. Use financial tools (secured loans, adjusting investment portfolios such as selling QQQ for QLD + cash) to meet consumption needs as much as possible without affecting the compound growth of core assets.</li>
<li><strong>Balance</strong>: Find a balance between wealth accumulation and enjoyment of life. It is not necessary to meet all requirements, but it is not possible to completely reject them. It is necessary to meet one or two needs that family members value every year or every few years.</li>
<li><strong>No need to explain too much</strong>: Actions speak louder than words. Express love through practical actions (such as buying a car), but there is no need to argue too much about concepts.</li>

<li>Sharing: Describes a complex arbitrage strategy: Using secured borrowing (leverage may exceed 1.5 times), puts some funds into a digital account in Taiwan (about 2% interest), and buys 00864B (USD money market fund) to try to cover the 2.8% borrowing cost. Also shared how to use credit card payments to get 0% interest installments and then use the money to buy 00864B for arbitrage.</li>
<li>Question: Is this operation feasible? Does it conform to the 442 configuration idea?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply:
<ol>
<li><strong>Not 442</strong>: What you described is an arbitrage strategy, not the 442 asset allocation based on long-term growth that we discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Arbitrage efficiency</strong>: Putting borrowed money (cost 2.8%) into a NTD account with 2% interest is losing money. All of it should be put into 00864B with higher returns (about 4.5%) and matching currencies (USD) for arbitrage. Exchange rate fluctuations are not important.</li>
<li><strong>Credit card arbitrage</strong>: It is feasible to use 0% interest installments for arbitrage, but it is a &ldquo;sesame green bean&rdquo; small trick and should not be distracted too much.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Experienced the 2008 financial crisis, assets were halved, and since then has attached importance to cash, maintaining 30-40% cash all year round. Dared to buy in when the market fell sharply in 2022 and made a profit at the end of the year.</li>
<li>Question 1: Made considerable profits last year and early this year and wanted to sell some at a high level to avoid a callback, but her husband prevented it because of concerns about high taxes (believing that it would push the tax bracket to 50%). How to deal with it?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Her husband&rsquo;s understanding of tax law is wrong. Long-term Capital Gain Tax is calculated separately from ordinary income tax. Its tax rate is tiered (usually 0%, 15%, 20%), and the highest is 20% (plus a possible 3.8% NIIT). Selling capital gains will not push ordinary income to an extremely high tax bracket (such as 50%). The tax rate for selling a lot of LTCG is basically fixed (it is 20% after reaching a certain amount). However, it is not recommended to time the market to sell. If you really want to operate, you should prioritize doing so in retirement accounts (such as IRA/401k). Selling has no immediate tax impact, and you can even buy reverse ETFs (such as SQQQ) for hedging in retirement accounts (advanced operation, not recommended).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Is it better to buy dividend-paying stocks or other things with the cash (Money Market) held? Worried about the tax on dividend-paying stocks.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Don&rsquo;t use dividend-paying stocks to hold cash, the tax efficiency is low. You should use money market funds. If you want to avoid both federal and state taxes, you can consider municipal bond funds (Muni Bond Fund, such as Vanguard&rsquo;s VOOX). If you only consider federal tax, you can use U.S. Treasury money market funds (such as SGOV, BIL). There is a capital gains tax problem only when selling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: I want to anonymously sponsor a talented child (a friend&rsquo;s child, with decent family conditions), but I don&rsquo;t want the other party to know now, how to operate? Worried about tax issues.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: Anonymous operation is difficult, especially involving opening an account. And the other party&rsquo;s family may not need sponsorship. A safer way is to write this child (providing name, address, and other information) into your own trust file as a beneficiary of future inheritance. This operation is simple and usually tax-free.</li>

<li>Question 1: In the United States, in addition to mortgage loans and stock pledges, what other similar low-cost sources of funds can be used like &ldquo;Han Xin counting soldiers&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: The U.S. financial market is highly efficient and has a lot of &ldquo;smart money,&rdquo; so the interest rate on unsecured personal loans is usually higher (such as 8% +). Unlike Taiwan, which has a large amount of low-cost funds (due to export-oriented currency abundance), there are indeed not many other low-cost, flexible sources of funds besides stock pledges (Pledge Loan). If you have channels in Taiwan to borrow low-interest NTD funds, you can consider it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Regarding children&rsquo;s college tuition fees, is it better for them to apply for student loans themselves (and we will use the pledged money to pay them back after graduation), or to pay directly with the pledged money? Which is better?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: There is no absolute right or wrong, it depends on the child&rsquo;s personality and feelings. If the child feels stressed about debt, pay directly. If the child understands financial leverage and the student loan conditions are favorable (such as interest only after graduation), you can let them take out the loan and the parents will pay it back later. The key is to communicate well with the child. The teacher shared his experience of paying his daughter&rsquo;s tuition fees directly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing: Fortunate to have followed the teacher&rsquo;s advice to sell the expensive house in Los Angeles and exchange it for a cheaper one and use a pledge loan. Now I feel relaxed, unlike some friends who are trapped in expensive houses and facing difficulties under the wave of layoffs.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comment: Yes, real estate has poor liquidity, especially when bought at a high price, which easily limits life choices and financial flexibility. Young people should be especially cautious.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: Concerns about U.S. Treasury bonds (such as the debt-to-GDP ratio, interest burden), is it possible that the world will stop buying U.S. bonds?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: U.S. assets (168T) far exceed debt (federal debt 36T). The interest burden is controllable relative to fiscal revenue and GDP. Countries around the world hold a large amount of USD reserves and must purchase USD assets (government bonds, treasury bills, money market funds, etc.) to store them. There are no other large-scale options to replace them. Therefore, the world will not stop buying U.S. bonds. A strong U.S. dollar is in the best interest of the United States.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: The price of SGOV (short-term treasury bond ETF) is rising slightly every day, while the price of TLT (long-term treasury bond ETF) has been falling recently, why?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: SGOV tracks short-term interest rates. Its mechanism is to accrue interest accumulation daily and the net value returns after dividends, showing a step-like slight oscillation. TLT represents long-term treasury bonds, and its price (yield) mainly reflects the market&rsquo;s <strong>expectations for future long-term inflation</strong>. If the market expects inflation to rise in the future (for example, worrying about tariffs leading to inflation), the yield on long-term treasury bonds will rise and the price of TLT will fall. This has little to do with the Fed&rsquo;s current short-term interest rate policy.</li>

<p>In this CLEC investment and financial management sharing session, James reiterated the core philosophy of long-term investment: embrace market volatility, adhere to holding index funds represented by QQQ, and build firm belief through continuous learning. The teacher analyzed the real situation of U.S. Treasury bonds in detail, believing that there is no need to worry too much, and clarified the misunderstanding about its interest burden and Musk&rsquo;s criticism. At the same time, it discussed the rational use of leverage, the importance of cash reserves (like air and magic weapons), and how to overcome psychological biases in investment. The Q&amp;A session involved asset allocation across accounts, Roth conversion, real estate processing (including Canadian non-resident tax issues and personal experience), children&rsquo;s education funding planning, the excellent value and experience of Tesla FSD, consumption concept balance (smart consumption vs. laborer thinking), the limited sources of low-cost funds in the United States, the driving factor differences between long-term and short-term treasury bond ETFs, and the correct understanding of U.S. long-term capital gains tax and other practical issues, providing specific operational suggestions and thinking frameworks. The core message is to maintain a long-term perspective, make rational decisions, use financial tools to achieve a balance between wealth growth and quality of life, while understanding and respecting the needs of the people around you.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Importance of Rebalancing:</strong> James stresses the importance of rebalancing at the end or beginning of the year. He recommends passive rebalancing, which means rebalancing when the market is performing well, to avoid panic selling during market downturns. He points out that many investors are reluctant to rebalance during market rallies, hoping to earn more, but end up succumbing to losses during declines and selling at the bottom, resulting in greater losses.</li>
<li><strong>Pledging Stocks for Tax Payment:</strong> He advises individuals with pledged stocks to borrow money for tax payments instead of selling the stocks to avoid increasing capital gains tax and to better utilize their funds. He emphasizes that under the premise of sound asset allocation and risk management, the borrowed money can be used flexibly.</li>
<li><strong>Real Estate Investment:</strong>  James advises against buying real estate, believing it restricts personal freedom. He uses the example of a friend in the Bay Area selling their property to support this viewpoint, pointing out the high holding costs of real estate, including property taxes, maintenance fees, and insurance, which can put significant financial pressure on individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Children&rsquo;s Education and Wealth Perspective:</strong> He suggests parents support their children&rsquo;s choices, believing that happiness is more important than wealth. Children shouldn&rsquo;t live for the sake of glorifying their family but should pursue happiness, serve others, and do what they love.</li>
<li><strong>433 Asset Allocation Plan:</strong> James recommends the 433 asset allocation plan (40% QQQ, 30% TQQQ, 30% Cash) for the general public, adjustable based on individual circumstances. For retirees who are not pledging stocks, he suggests an 80/20 allocation (80% index funds, 20% cash). For investors unfamiliar with or averse to leveraged ETFs, he recommends 100% investment in QQQ or 00662.</li>
<li><strong>Taiwan&rsquo;s Investment Environment Advantage:</strong> James highly praises Taiwan&rsquo;s investment environment, believing it possesses cutting-edge financial tools, tax-free policies, and low interest rates, making it an ideal place for investment. He encourages Taiwanese investors to leverage this advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Mid-Life Investment Strategy:</strong> He advises middle-aged individuals, even with modest incomes, to persist in monthly investments, accumulating wealth gradually for retirement. He illustrates the returns of monthly investments of 5,000 and 10,000 at retirement with specific examples.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of Nasdaq 100 Index Funds:</strong> James explains the rationale for investing in QQQ, stating that its constituent companies have strong profitability, focus on technology and innovation, and align with long-term human development trends. He also points out that the constituent companies of the Nasdaq 100 index have stronger profitability compared to the S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong>  He advocates for the &ldquo;buy whenever you have money, never sell&rdquo; strategy, ignoring short-term fluctuations and believing in the long-term upward trajectory of the market. He emphasizes that the purpose of investment is wealth appreciation, not short-term gains, and criticizes the drawbacks of short-term trading.</li>
<li><strong>The Difference Between the Rich and the Poor:</strong> James points out that the rich possess assets and credit, which they can use to &ldquo;print money&rdquo; through leverage for rapid wealth growth.  The poor, lacking investment knowledge, keep their money in banks, missing out on wealth growth opportunities. He uses the example of Warren Buffett issuing bonds to illustrate how the rich utilize credit for investment.</li>
<li><strong>Three Contributions of Investors:</strong>  First, allocating capital to the most efficient companies, promoting technological advancement; second, helping the government invest idle foreign exchange reserves; third, helping the poor activate their funds, maximizing their social value.</li>

<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s comments: Suggests focusing on long-term performance rather than short-term fluctuations and explains that QQQ&rsquo;s smaller market cap is due to the relatively low number of people who understand and invest in it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 1:  The impact of QQQ component adjustments and rebalancing mechanisms on investments, and whether one should invest in the smaller 90 companies.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply:  Advises focusing on long-term performance and volatility, not short-term component adjustments. QQQ&rsquo;s adjustment mechanism ensures the inclusion of the best companies, illustrated by the performance of Mega 7 and MAGS.

<ul>
<li>Question 1:  FNGS has performed better than QQQ. Can FNGS replace QQQ?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: No, because FNGS has excessive volatility and higher risk, illustrated by the 2000 tech bubble.  Emphasizes that asset allocation should consider volatility and maximum drawdown, not just performance. In the long run, QQQ offers better stability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: XLG has lower volatility than QQQ and decent returns.  Is it suitable for allocation?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo;s reply: No, because XLG&rsquo;s long-term performance is inferior to QQQ. He provides a performance comparison of QQQ and XLG from 2006 to the present, showing QQQ&rsquo;s significantly higher returns. Emphasizes focusing on long-term performance and avoiding investments with poor long-term track records despite low short-term volatility.

We are currently in the early stages of this growth.  Morris Chang (TSMC Chairman)&rsquo;s perspective and TSMC&rsquo;s investments in AI corroborate this judgment. The long bull market has begun, seize the opportunity to join the wealth train.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility and Long-Term Investment:</strong> Market fluctuations are inherent to investing.  Downswings are followed by even greater upswings. Using historical data from the Taiwan Weighted Index, Nikkei Index, and the US stock market as examples, the session illustrates the long-term market development pattern: an initial period of rapid growth followed by a period of stagnation (e.g., 32 years in Taiwan, 35 years in Japan, 24 years in the US), before entering a phase of stable growth.  Therefore, overcoming panic caused by market volatility and adhering to a long-term investment strategy is crucial for ultimate success.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalism and Investment:</strong>  The side effects of capitalism are wealth disparity and the exploitation of labor. Learn to operate like a capitalist and profit from investment.  Hard work and saving money to buy government bonds will ultimately result in wealth erosion due to inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits of Quantitative Easing:</strong> Quantitative easing is beneficial for investors, fostering a low-interest-rate environment and driving asset price appreciation.  Those who fail to understand quantitative easing and complain about government money printing are often victims of capitalism, missing out on the benefits of asset appreciation.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics of a Mature Market:</strong> Mature markets are characterized by fair, just, and transparent regulatory mechanisms, companies focused on their core businesses, and a high proportion of long-term investors and institutional holdings. The Taiwanese market is gradually maturing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Investment Strategies and Recommendations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invest in Nasdaq 100:</strong>  The session recommends investing in Nasdaq 100 index funds (QQQ), with the option to allocate to S&amp;P 500 or high-dividend ETFs based on individual circumstances.  References to Nasdaq 100 index funds globally are provided for the convenience of investors worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Penny Stocks:</strong>  Refrain from investing in penny stocks, as they generally offer low long-term returns.  Real investment opportunities lie in companies that demonstrate sustained growth and lead technological advancements.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of Stock Pledging:</strong> Stock pledging offers advantages over real estate mortgages, as stocks, unlike real estate, do not depreciate and can be held long-term, potentially allowing for &ldquo;borrowing without repayment or interest&rdquo; (specific instructions are available in related videos).</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Flawed Rebalancing Strategies:</strong> Avoid a 50% principal + 50% leveraged ETF rebalancing strategy, as it carries high risk and can easily deplete cash reserves during market downturns.</li>
<li><strong>Estate Planning and Stock Pledging:</strong> When engaging in stock pledging, it is advisable to diversify assets across multiple brokerage firms, pledging a portion and keeping the rest as cash to facilitate estate handling for inheritors.  Cat supplemented this with a detailed explanation of the stock pledging inheritance process, emphasizing the importance of advance planning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Other Important Matters:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Warning and Disclaimer:</strong>  The content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.  Do not remit funds to unknown accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Program Format Adjustment:</strong>  The presentation content will be expanded to include material previously covered in short videos.</li>
<li><strong>QQQ Stock Selection Mechanism:</strong>  Addresses audience questions regarding the QQQ stock selection mechanism, explaining the advantages of the Nasdaq exchange and why technology companies prefer listing on Nasdaq.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Pledging for Non-US Residents:</strong> Explains the regulations for non-US residents engaging in stock pledging with US brokers.</li>
<li><strong>Learning to Spend:</strong> Shares the philosophy of spending after achieving investment success, emphasizing the importance of focusing on future wealth growth and utilizing financial leverage for consumption.  Don&rsquo;t let wealth sit idle; learn how to use it.  This point is illustrated with the example of a listener who has $4 million but doesn&rsquo;t know how to spend it, calculating their potential wealth growth over 40 years and a reasonable spending level.</li>

</h2>
<p><strong>IAM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Expressed confusion about different types of economic crises and how the 2020-2023 pandemic period compares to previous bubbles after reading a book about economic crises.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  Which historical economic crisis is most similar to the economic downturn during the 2020-2023 pandemic?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The 2020-2023 pandemic was an economic shock caused by an external event, distinct from previous bubble economies. The 2000 dot-com bubble was an industry bubble with limited impact; the 2008 financial crisis resembled the 1929 Great Depression, both being asset bubble bursts, but the 2008 crisis recovered faster due to quantitative easing. The 2022 market decline was not a bubble burst, but a revaluation caused by central bank interest rate hikes.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> What did the US do to stimulate the economy that other countries couldn&rsquo;t replicate?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The US is less constrained by fiscal discipline and is willing to borrow and issue debt, allocating funds to social welfare programs for the elderly, children, and healthcare, while guiding domestic capital towards overseas investment to mitigate inflation.  Taiwan&rsquo;s government was advised to learn from the US&rsquo;s fiscal spending approach and guide capital towards investment, while also focusing on efficient capital utilization and building a social safety net.</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> Why are Chinese people so keen on buying houses?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> This is a vestige of the agrarian &ldquo;land is wealth&rdquo; mentality, which is no longer applicable today.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eason (Doctor):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Points to consider for Chinese investors buying Nasdaq ETFs:
<ul>
<li>Different brokerage firms have different fee policies and financing rates; careful comparison is necessary.</li>
<li>Domestic Nasdaq ETFs have premiums; buying during periods of low or negative premiums is recommended.  There are no limits for buying ETFs on the exchange, but there are limits for off-exchange subscriptions.</li>
<li>Recommends allocating a portion of assets to USD-denominated investments like QQQ, which can be purchased by opening brokerage accounts in Singapore or Hong Kong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Added:</strong>  Chinese residents have a $50,000 annual foreign exchange quota for overseas investments.  Hong Kong and mainland China identities have different withholding tax rates on US stock investments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dave:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Will the Nasdaq 100 index become stagnant like the Dow Jones index?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Currently, the Nasdaq 100 is the most competitive; excessive worry about the future is unnecessary.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> Is it feasible to only buy the top 10 companies in the Nasdaq 100 index?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The top ten companies change frequently; individual stock selection and portfolio adjustments are too cumbersome, and returns may not be higher.  Investing directly in index funds is more efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> How do VGT and XLK compare to QQQ?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> VGT and XLK track different indices than QQQ, with different constituent stocks and concentration. QQQ is more robust and has broader coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jiawen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Can an 80% leveraged ETF + 10% cash + 10% bond portfolio be directly pledged? How is this done?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, but a small-scale trial is recommended, for instance, borrowing $200,000 against $5 million in principal, or borrowing within $1 million against $10 million. Long-term borrowing strategies should be adjusted according to circumstances. It&rsquo;s possible to pledge only a portion of the stocks, leaving the remainder for additional purchases or other uses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Personal investment journey, transitioning from real estate to stocks, learning about stock pledging and asset allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Is there synergy between real estate and stock investment? How can real estate cash flow be used for stock investment?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  Buying a house is not recommended for young people. Real estate investment returns are lower than stocks and come with various risks (e.g., natural disasters, property taxes).  Even with positive cash flow, opportunity costs should be considered; investing that capital in stocks might yield higher returns.  Used Texas real estate as an example to illustrate the drawbacks of real estate investment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Qiu Xiao:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  What are the Canadian equivalents of US retirement accounts like IRA, Roth IRA, and 401k? Which account should cash be held in?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Roth IRA corresponds to Canada&rsquo;s TFSA, Traditional IRA to RRSP, and 401k to DCPP. The choice of retirement account for cash depends on the individual&rsquo;s balance between taxable and tax-free accounts and their asset allocation strategy.  One should choose to place cash in either a tax-free or taxable account based on their specific circumstances for tax optimization.</li>
<li><strong>Question 2 (Related to Eason&rsquo;s question):</strong> How can one invest in Nasdaq ETFs in China, and how can quota limitations be addressed?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Off-exchange subscriptions have quota limits, while on-exchange ETF purchases do not, but premiums should be considered.  Opening multiple brokerage accounts or opening an account in Hong Kong for US stock investment can be considered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Haoqing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Used the example of SpaceX launching rockets with a small team to highlight concerns about AI replacing human labor and the difficulties young people face in finding employment.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How can we address the challenge of youth unemployment in the AI era?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>  Young people need to acquire AI skills to adapt to the future job market.  Recommends that schools incorporate AI courses into their core curriculum, cultivating AI talent from a young age. Philosophy is an important foundational subject but should not be a primary career focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jimmy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Discussed the changing times and the need for young people to adapt, sharing observations about the youthful demographics of Xiamen. Mentioned the importance of aligning investments with the times and shared some common misunderstandings about investing he had encountered.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What are your views on index fund investing? Is the long-term return of 0050 sufficient? What are your thoughts on individual stock investing (e.g., TSMC)?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Index fund investing is a method accessible to the general public, but many don&rsquo;t understand it and require time and experience to appreciate it. In the long run, QQQ and SPY offer higher returns and are more suitable for long-term investment. Individual stock picking demands specialized knowledge and skills and carries higher risks; it is difficult for average investors to select and hold high-quality stocks like TSMC for the long term.  The key to investing is finding investment targets that can be held long-term and sticking with them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Q&amp;A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TQQQ Pledging:</strong>  Learn about stock pledging and how to achieve interest-free borrowing through the recommended videos.</li>
<li><strong>Top 10 QQQ Holdings:</strong>  Frequent trading is discouraged; holding the index fund long-term is sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>BOX vs. SWVXX:</strong>  BOX is recommended for brokerage accounts to avoid dividend taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Conservative Investing:</strong>  Conservative investing can involve holding cash or holding index funds long-term.</li>
<li><strong>How to Spend Money:</strong>  Focus on future wealth growth and utilize financial leverage for consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Investing in US Stocks from within China:</strong>  Coming to the US to invest or remitting funds to the US for investment is recommended.  Consider opening an account in Hong Kong or using other compliant channels for investment.</li>

<p>The most important thing in investing is <strong>maximizing the probability of success</strong>, not maximizing returns. Investors should <strong>control risks</strong>, <strong>avoid being forced to interrupt compounding due to market fluctuations</strong>, and choose investment portfolios that can be <strong>held for the long term</strong>. James emphasizes the importance of asset allocation, especially the role of cash, and the need to choose appropriate investment strategies based on different individuals (retired/not retired, different asset sizes).</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The Most Important Thing in Investing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The goal of investing is to maximize the probability of success, not to maximize the rate of return.</li>
<li>Risk management is to maximize the success of the investment portfolio and avoid interrupting compound growth due to being forced to sell because of market fluctuations.</li>
<li>Good investment assets must be able to withstand fear and panic. The best investment strategies are those that do not create fear and panic.</li>
<li>Sufficient cash is the best asset to help you sleep well and survive a sharp market decline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Stock Pledging:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Stock pledging can easily lead to bankruptcy if asset allocation is not done properly.</li>
<li>Do not try stock pledging lightly if you do not understand the operating principles of stock pledging, otherwise, you will most likely go bankrupt.</li>
<li>Most people do not need to do stock pledging. Good asset allocation can make you rich without pledging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation for Different Individuals:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individuals who are not retired and have salary income:</strong> Refer to the article &ldquo;Asset Allocation for Those Who Are Still Some Time Away from Retirement&rdquo;, with QQQ as the main investment.</li>
<li><strong>Individuals who are retired and have no income:</strong> Refer to the article &ldquo;Asset Allocation for Those Who Are Retired and Have No Income&rdquo;, and choose QQQ, SPY, or high-dividend ETFs for allocation based on asset size, and consider the withdrawal rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Investment and Life Philosophy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Investing is like life. It requires continuous learning and experiencing different stages to find an investment strategy that suits you.</li>
<li>Resist temptation, avoid chasing short-term hotspots, and adhere to long-term investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>A-share Market Volatility:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The A-share market has recently experienced a surge and a plunge, with many investors being trapped due to chasing hotspots.</li>
<li>Market fluctuations are normal, especially in emerging markets. Investors need to be rational and adhere to long-term investment strategies.</li>
<li>The Chinese government&rsquo;s cooling measures are aimed at preventing further expansion of the bubble and protecting the interests of investors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Beware of Pump and Dump Schemes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some online groups and &ldquo;teachers&rdquo; use market forecasts and insider information to induce investors to make trades and profit from them. Be wary of these pump and dump schemes.</li>
<li>The futures market, due to its smaller scale, is more susceptible to manipulation. Be wary of pump and dump schemes in the futures market as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CLEC Investment and Financial Management Channel Update Plan:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Due to the time-consuming nature of producing short videos and the low viewership, we plan to stop updating short videos.</li>
<li>The content of the produced short videos will be condensed into a briefing format and shared with you on Saturdays for discussion.</li>
<li>It is recommended that you listen to long videos several times or listen to them in segments to achieve the same learning effect.</li>

<p><strong>Ethan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong> In China, a similar effect to stock pledging can be achieved through the margin financing function of securities firms.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong> The A-share market has recently experienced drastic fluctuations, and many investors have been influenced by the media to chase hotspots, resulting in heavy losses.</li>
<li><strong>Viewpoint:</strong> If you don&rsquo;t have the right understanding of the stock market, you are the victim.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jackie:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>  Her personal journey of investing in the Nasdaq, from skepticism to firm holding, and finally overcoming psychological barriers to achieve &ldquo;buy whenever you have money&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>H:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>  Followed recommendations for meme stocks in 2021, resulting in heavy losses. Started gradually transferring funds to QQQ in 2023 and using leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  The current proportions of QQQ, QLD, and SGOV have deviated from the initial 70%, 20%, and 10%. Is rebalancing needed? How should it be rebalanced?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  It is recommended to adopt a smart rebalancing strategy. Transfer 30% of the QLD profits to SGOV. When the market falls, transfer 2% of the total assets in cash to QLD.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Im:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>  Uses the mural story of Journey to the West as an analogy for the different stages of investment, reminding investors not to chase short-term gains and to adhere to long-term investment and continuous learning.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to persuade people who spend extravagantly to develop the habit of saving?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  You can introduce them to the concept of long-term investment in index funds and the power of compound growth. Provide help within your means.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  If you also have the habit of spending extravagantly, how do you control it?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  Live within your means. As your wealth grows, it is normal for your living standards to gradually improve within the scope of risk control, but avoid excessive consumption and spending beyond your means.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sunny:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>  The CLEC course not only teaches investment knowledge but also conveys life philosophy, helping everyone maintain a stable mindset in life and work.</li>
<li><strong>Viewpoint:</strong>  People with stable emotions are the most valuable. Investing in QQQ also brings peace of mind.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Beisen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background:</strong>  Assets of 70 million, monthly mortgage payment of 125,000.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to allocate assets to achieve early retirement?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  Based on the current assets and expenses, immediate retirement is not possible. It is recommended to try the SPY asset allocation strategy, or use part of the funds to invest in high-dividend ETFs, and control the withdrawal rate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Why has Tesla fallen so much?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  Investing in individual stocks requires understanding the company better than the CEO to grasp the ups and downs of the stock price. If you don&rsquo;t understand Tesla&rsquo;s business model, you shouldn&rsquo;t invest in it.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  If you are very confident in Tesla, can you hold it for the long term?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  If you truly understand and are optimistic about Tesla, you can hold it for the long term, but you must manage risks well.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Does the teacher think the stock market will fall to zero?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  &ldquo;Falling to zero&rdquo; is a figure of speech, which means that even if the stock does not completely fall to zero, it will not be able to be realized if it falls to a certain level, and cash is needed to maintain life.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ming:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>  I have invested in individual stocks before, and they all ended up going to zero in the end, so now I want to learn how to invest in index ETFs.</li>
<li><strong>Background:</strong>  Total assets of 3.3 million, of which 2 million are in a brokerage account, 300,000 are in a Roth account, and 1 million are in a traditional IRA account.  About to retire.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to allocate cash and index ETFs?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  It is recommended to fully invest the brokerage account in SPY, the Roth account in TQQQ, and 60% of the traditional IRA account in money market funds and 40% in SPY.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to withdraw funds after retirement? Do you sell even in a loss state?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  After retirement, you can withdraw 3% of your total assets for living expenses. You can sell SPY or obtain funds through stock pledging loans. You have to sell even in a loss state because you need cash to maintain your life.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Is the risk of investing in TQQQ in a Roth account too high?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  It is to maintain a certain cash ratio while obtaining relatively high returns. In extreme cases, you can transfer cash from the traditional IRA to the brokerage account or sell TQQQ to supplement cash.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to transfer funds from a traditional IRA to a Roth account?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  Transfer out a portion of the money every year and use loans or salary to pay taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Why is the borrowing interest rate 5% and the cash interest rate only 2.5% when calculating interest in SPACE?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  This is just a conservative estimate. The yield of money market funds is usually lower than the borrowing interest rate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sara:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>  I have been investing in QQQ for three years and recently also invested in meme stocks.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  I plan to borrow money to invest. Should I buy QLD? How should cash be allocated?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  Based on Sara&rsquo;s questions, it can be seen that she does not understand the concepts of stock pledging, leveraged ETFs, and asset allocation. Borrowing money to invest is not recommended. It is recommended to continue holding the 80% QQQ + 20% cash portfolio, and cash can be invested in BOXS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to maintain the cash ratio and avoid excessive tax rates in the case of long-term borrowing to live?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Leveraged ETFs and cash should be placed in retirement accounts as much as possible.</li>
<li>Borrowing from a brokerage account should not exceed 70% of the account assets.</li>
<li>Invest Roth IRA in TQQQ and hold cash in a traditional IRA.</li>
<li>In extreme cases, the cash in the traditional IRA can be transferred to the brokerage account or TQQQ can be sold to supplement cash.</li>
<li>The borrowing amount should be controlled within a certain range, for example, not exceeding 2% of the total assets per year.</li>
<li>Taxes incurred by transferring a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA can be paid with loans or salary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Why is the borrowing interest rate 5% while the cash interest rate is only calculated as 2.5% in SPACE?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  This is just a conservative estimate. Money market fund yields are usually lower than borrowing rates.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to handle it if funds in the Brokerage account need to be used before retirement?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  You can use the funds in the Brokerage account for a pledge loan, but you need sufficient cash as a guarantee.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  What if the cash in the Brokerage account is insufficient to cover the loan in the event of an extreme stock market decline?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  In extreme cases, you can transfer the cash in the Roth or Traditional IRA account to the Brokerage account, but this is an emergency measure and will incur penalties.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  Is investing TQQQ in a Roth IRA too risky?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  Investing Roth IRA in TQQQ is to obtain higher returns while ensuring a certain cash ratio. If you are concerned about risks, you can appropriately reduce the proportion of TQQQ and increase the proportion of money market funds.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  In the long run, will borrowing from a Brokerage account lead to paying high taxes?</li>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Reply:</strong>  Borrowing itself does not increase the tax burden, but it can avoid the tax burden caused by selling stocks. However, if you transfer funds from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, it will increase your taxable income for the year and you will need to pay additional taxes.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The most important thing in investing is maximizing the probability of success, not maximizing the rate of return.</strong>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To achieve long-term stable returns, control risks, avoid being forced to interrupt compound growth due to market fluctuations, and choose investment portfolios that can be held for the long term.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t try stock pledging lightly if you don&rsquo;t understand it.</strong>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stock pledging is very risky if not done properly and can lead to bankruptcy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Most people don&rsquo;t need to do stock pledging and can still become wealthy without it.</strong>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good asset allocation and long-term investment can lead to financial freedom even without stock pledging.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If you don&rsquo;t have the right understanding of the stock market, you are the victim.</strong>
&ndash; Ethan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learn investment knowledge, understand market rules, and avoid becoming a韭菜 (leek, a metaphor for someone easily exploited in the stock market).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Investing is like life. You need to keep learning to find an investment strategy that suits you.</strong>
&ndash; Im</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Investing is a continuous learning process. You need to constantly improve your cognitive level to succeed in the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>People with stable emotions are the most valuable. Investing in QQQ also brings peace of mind.</strong>
&ndash; Sunny</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Investing requires rationality and avoiding emotional trading to succeed in market volatility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rotten apples don&rsquo;t get better, and broken elevators don&rsquo;t fix themselves.</strong>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the individual stocks you hold are not performing well, cut your losses in time and switch to more potential investment targets.</p>
