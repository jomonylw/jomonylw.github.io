<p>This session&rsquo;s theme revolves around &ldquo;The market always goes up, live for yourself.&rdquo; The core idea is that the essence of investing is very simple: believe in the market&rsquo;s long-term upward trend and hold on. The real challenge is psychological. Therefore, we should not be disturbed by short-term market fluctuations, financial news, world events, or other external information. Instead, we should shift our focus back to life itself—concentrating on health, happiness, family, and personal values, viewing money as a tool to achieve freedom and abundance in life, not as the ultimate goal.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth and Happiness</strong>: Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right, and health is the foundation. Money is just a tool to achieve a free, abundant, and happy life; investing itself is not the purpose of life.</li>
<li><strong>Children&rsquo;s Education</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Focus on cultivating the right values in children (not stealing, robbing, breaking the law, or taking drugs) and appreciating their talents, rather than just focusing on academic performance.</li>
<li>Parents should not impose their own expectations or unfulfilled dreams on their children, such as forcing them to study abroad. This puts immense pressure on the children.</li>
<li>A true home is where the parents are. Children should be encouraged to pursue their own ideals, not to satisfy their parents&rsquo; expectations.</li>
<li>Compared to buying a house for a child, it&rsquo;s better to have and raise the child first, because wealth can be created, but childbirth has a time window.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Live in the Present, Focus on Yourself</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In life, focus on your own goals. Don&rsquo;t get sidetracked by trivial matters (like fussing over exchange rates or searching for better investments), as this will only delay the process of achieving financial freedom.</li>
<li>Teacher James uses his own management experience as an example: At the company, he focused on only the three most important tasks each day. Once completed, he could go home. This approach is efficient and goal-oriented. Conversely, trying to do everything results in being busy all day with nothing accomplished.</li>
<li>Live your own life, not one led by the media and online information. Cutting off useless external information will not result in any loss.</li>
<li>True living is about &ldquo;presence&rdquo;—living in the moment. Whether eating, gardening, or traveling, you should be fully engaged and feel the beauty of life itself. External distractions, like what Trump said, have no bearing on our lives or investments.</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do the Right Thing and Persist</strong>: The secret to successful investing is to &ldquo;do the right thing and stick with it for the long term.&rdquo; For example, invest whenever you have money, regardless of the exchange rate, without timing the market. Once you have identified the right path (like investing in QQQ), you should forge ahead without looking back.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Mortgage</strong>:
<ul>
<li>This is an excellent tool for &ldquo;activating assets&rdquo; and is not just for people short on cash.</li>
<li>It provides a steady cash flow, as if the house is working for you. This money can be used for investment, thus increasing your assets while retaining the property.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a great option for parents with insufficient retirement funds, allowing them to live better lives without their children needing to provide financial support.</li>
<li>For elderly individuals with weak financial management skills and only one house left, a reverse mortgage is more stable than selling the house to invest, avoiding the risk of losing their last home.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Borrowing to Invest</strong>:
<ul>
<li>An example: If you use your own $30,000 to buy a car, the potential value of that money in 50 years (about $32 million) is lost. But if you take a pledged loan of $30,000 to buy the car and invest your own $30,000, in 50 years you will have $32 million in assets, while the debt is only $340,000.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Make good use of financial leverage. Borrow for consumption or investment, and let your own money continue to grow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example of Leveraged Asset Allocation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Teacher James shares his asset allocation model: 40% QQQ (1x), 15% QLD (2x), 10% TQQQ (3x), and 35% cash.</li>
<li>The Beta value of this portfolio is calculated as: (40% * 1) + (15% * 2) + (10% * 3) = 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.3 = 1.0.</li>
<li>This allocation, while having an overall risk comparable to holding 100% QQQ (Beta=1.0), retains a large amount of cash (35%) for risk control and rebalancing during market downturns.</li>
<li><strong>Key Point</strong>: Any asset allocation that includes leveraged funds <strong>must</strong> implement a smart rebalancing strategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Sharing: She once went against everyone&rsquo;s advice to support her sister&rsquo;s dream of a working holiday in Australia. Now, her sister is living very happily in Germany. She has come to realize that since her child doesn&rsquo;t want to study abroad, she&rsquo;ll save the money for her own study tours in retirement. She is practicing not imposing her expectations on her child.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: That&rsquo;s excellent. One must live for oneself, not for others. Don&rsquo;t impose your expectations on people. For children, parents only have the duty to agree, not the right to disagree. Your child&rsquo;s life is not under your jurisdiction.</li>

<li>He has compiled his years of learning from the teacher into the &ldquo;Great Way is Simple Investment Method&rdquo; and created the &ldquo;Chen Feng Leads the Way&rdquo; website to share it.</li>
<li>He summarizes the CLEC investment method into three simple but not easy things: <strong>Asset Allocation</strong> (70/30 for beginners, eventually 433), <strong>Rebalancing</strong> (once a year), and <strong>Living off Pledged Loans</strong>.</li>
<li>He believes the hardest part of investing is psychology, which is why the teacher insists on holding weekly classes to help everyone adjust their mindset.</li>

<li>Sharing: After renting out a house he owns, he recently took it back for his own use and found being a landlord very troublesome. He had to deal with various damages and cleaning for walls, doors, and windows, and deeply realized that the actual return on real estate investment is not as high as it seems.</li>
<li>Question 1: Since the house was bought by his family, he can&rsquo;t sell it freely. He&rsquo;s thinking of taking out a mortgage-like loan on the house (interest-only payments) and investing the cash into 00662. Is this idea feasible?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Absolutely correct, you should do it immediately. Borrow any money you can as soon as possible. The power of borrowing to invest is immense. He demonstrated the huge opportunity cost difference by calculating the 50-year outcomes of buying a car with $30,000 versus borrowing $1 million.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: The teacher advises young people to invest first and buy a house later when they are &ldquo;old.&rdquo; What age does &ldquo;old&rdquo; approximately refer to?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You will know when the time comes; you don&rsquo;t need someone else to tell you. When you are wealthy enough, buying a house will be as easy as buying slippers, and you can even use borrowed money to buy one casually. At that point, you could also choose to live in a luxurious retirement community—the choice is yours.</li>

<li>Question: She is in her fifties/sixties and wants to take out a pledged loan in China on her fully paid-off house, but banks only offer a maximum term of 3-5 years, which is too risky. How does the teacher obtain long-term loans?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: The best long-term loan is a &ldquo;stock-pledged loan,&rdquo; which can be structured to never pay back the principal, and even the interest can be rolled into the principal. Mortgages and personal loans have fixed terms and are not suitable. For short-term loans (like 3-5 years), don&rsquo;t borrow unless you are confident you can repay even if the market crashes. He suggests she sell her house in China, even at a lower price, as long as she can liquidate it. Abroad, she can try using Interactive Brokers (IB) for stock-pledged loans.</li>

<li>Sharing: Inspired by the teacher, he successfully borrowed a large sum of money from the bank against his assets and discovered that car loans don&rsquo;t count towards his debt ratio. He plans to use a 2% pledged loan to pay off the car loan, thereby investing more funds into the 433 allocation. He now feels that the speed of his asset growth has surpassed his annual salary.</li>
<li>Question: He saw a YouTuber say that Chinese engineers in Silicon Valley are unhappy due to endless &ldquo;comparisons&rdquo; (of degrees, companies, salaries, houses, wives, children). As someone with a master&rsquo;s degree, he also felt insecure in an environment full of PhDs. How does the teacher view &ldquo;comparison&rdquo;? And how can the teacher confidently pay his subordinates a higher salary than his own?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Quoting Munger, &ldquo;Envy is a really stupid sin.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t compare; the key is a strong inner self. You must affirm from within that you are the best. The way you see yourself is more important than how others see you. He uses his own experience of leading a team of PhDs without a PhD himself, and designing Microsoft&rsquo;s Media architecture and the computer Hibernate patent, to illustrate that success is unrelated to academic degrees but is related to confidence and intellect.</li>

<li>Question 1: She is 60 and retired. As recommended, she has allocated TQQQ in her smaller Roth IRA account. However, the AI on Chen Feng&rsquo;s website advises her not to use leverage at her age and to keep many years of cash. How much cash should a retiree actually keep? Is it 30% or 15 years&rsquo; worth of living expenses?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t fully trust the AI; follow the teacher&rsquo;s instruction. Her allocation (TQQQ in Roth, cash in Traditional IRA) is correct. Retirees should keep <strong>30% cash</strong>, which is approximately equivalent to <strong>15 years&rsquo; worth</strong> of living expenses. This is not due to pessimism about the market; on the contrary, the market may rise even faster in the future. This is the result of the CLEC investment system&rsquo;s &ldquo;DNA evolution&rdquo; after being tested by the market, making it better able to withstand future extreme risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: She saw other financial bloggers advocating for market timing using &ldquo;economic indicator signals&rdquo; and is worried that buying TQQQ at a market high will lead to significant decay.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Don&rsquo;t refer to other people&rsquo;s investment systems; they won&rsquo;t be compatible. Within the 433 asset allocation, there is no so-called &ldquo;decay&rdquo; problem for TQQQ because the large cash reserve acts as a buffer, and the actual drop of the portfolio during a downturn will be less than that of 100% QQQ.</li>

<li>Question 1: She is 43 and just immigrated to the US. Her 401k and IRA accounts have very little money. To implement the 433 allocation, it seems she can only buy leveraged ETFs in a taxable brokerage account. Is this acceptable?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Yes. In the early stages when funds are insufficient, you can use a 433 allocation in a brokerage account to maintain a higher Beta and sufficient cash. Although rebalancing will generate taxes, the priority is to &ldquo;make money first.&rdquo; However, you must <strong>do smart rebalancing every year</strong>, because a 30% leveraged position is very risky and cannot be left unattended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: For dollar-cost averaging for an 11-year-old child, the teacher previously recommended QLD. Why not the better TQQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: TQQQ has extremely high volatility. Calculating from the 2000 peak, it might take over 20 years to break even, whereas QLD breaks even faster. For a child&rsquo;s long-term investment of over 20 years, both are acceptable, but the premise is that you <strong>must persist in buying continuously</strong>, regardless of market ups and downs. If the investment horizon is uncertain or you want to be more conservative, QLD is the safer choice.</li>

<li>Question: Should high-net-worth families be concerned about the 40% US estate tax? Should they set up an irrevocable trust in advance to avoid it?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: First, the US estate tax exemption has been permanently set at $15 million per person, meaning a couple has a $30 million exemption. Most families don&rsquo;t need to worry. Second, he does not recommend setting up an irrevocable charitable trust because they usually require an annual donation of 5% of assets, which is a huge burden and constraint on the children. A better way is to use the annual gift tax exclusion (e.g., $20,000) and start gifting early. Over the long term, the growth of the gifted assets will far exceed the estate tax exemption amount.</li>

<li>Question: She (in Canada) obtained extra cash for investment through a home refinance. Can the interest on this portion of the loan be deducted as an investment expense for tax purposes?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Only when you sell an asset and generate a realized capital gain do you have taxable investment income against which related expenses might be deducted. If you just hold and don&rsquo;t sell, there is no taxable event. Canada&rsquo;s Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is similar to the US Roth IRA, and investment and rebalancing operations should be conducted within it.</li>

<li>Question (from the comment section): With 30 million TWD in assets, if I withdraw 2% for living expenses, 600,000 per year is not enough. Do I have to wait until my assets double to 60 million to live a good life?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Not necessarily. You can increase the withdrawal rate by adjusting your asset allocation. For example, you can change the 433 allocation (Beta=1) to a 424 or 514 allocation with a higher cash percentage, which lowers the portfolio&rsquo;s volatility (Beta&lt;1). Once the volatility is reduced, the annual withdrawal rate can be safely increased to 3% or 3.5%.</li>

<li>Question (from the comment section): Is it okay for a 12-year-old child to dollar-cost average into 00670L (a 2x leveraged ETF in Taiwan)?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: If you can ensure continuous investment for over 20 years (e.g., until age 32), it is acceptable. However, if the investment horizon is shorter (e.g., until they become independent at 24), it is recommended to do half-and-half (half leveraged, half non-leveraged) or invest entirely in the non-leveraged ETF to reduce risk.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is a gift, happiness is a human right, and health is the foundation of life.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: At the beginning of the class, the teacher explained the relationship between investment and life, emphasizing that our ultimate goals are happiness and health, while wealth is an innate right and a tool to achieve those goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you living your own life, or a life defined by the external environment? Don&rsquo;t be led by outside information.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: The teacher advised students not to be engrossed in media and online information all day, as that is living a life defined by others, not their own. One should return to their inner self and focus on their own life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Envy is a really stupid sin.
&ndash; Teacher James (quoting Charlie Munger)</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When answering a student&rsquo;s question about &ldquo;comparison,&rdquo; the teacher quoted Munger&rsquo;s famous line, pointing out that comparing oneself to others is a source of unhappiness and a foolish act.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are what you think you are, and that is more important than how others see you. If you don&rsquo;t even believe in what you are, how can others believe in what you are?
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: The teacher encouraged students to build self-confidence. He believes that personal value is determined by self-perception, not by external evaluations or labels like academic degrees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When borrowing money, we don&rsquo;t fear high interest rates; we fear that the term is too short.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When answering a question about loans, the teacher stressed the importance of the loan term. As long as the term is long enough, even with a higher interest rate, the long-term growth of assets is sufficient to cover the costs, whereas short-term loans carry immense risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be clear about what you want. For everything else that is different from what you want, you don&rsquo;t need to care, you don&rsquo;t need to mind, and you don&rsquo;t need to compare.
&ndash; Chen Feng</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: Student Chen Feng shared this perspective when explaining how he avoids the &ldquo;comparison&rdquo; mindset. He believes that as long as you are clear about your own goals, you will not be disturbed by external factors unrelated to them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you keep following our DNA, your DNA will evolve. This is how you can prepare for potential future risks and changes.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When explaining why he now recommends holding more cash (30%), the teacher compared the CLEC investment system to a biological DNA. This system continuously evolves after being tested by the market, becoming better adapted to various future environments. Therefore, students need to keep learning to acquire this &ldquo;evolved&rdquo; and robust system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are 100% in leveraged funds, you might go to hell; it would be like a dream that ends in 30 years.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>Context: When reminding students of the risks of leveraged funds, the teacher seriously pointed out that being fully invested in leveraged funds without asset allocation and rebalancing could ultimately lead to a total loss in a major market crash.</p>

<p>This session once again emphasized the core of the CLEC investment philosophy: investing is simple, mindset is supreme. Starting from a high-level life philosophy, Teacher James guided everyone to shift their focus from the complex noise of the market to the simple purity of their personal lives, fostering the belief to &ldquo;live for yourself.&rdquo; The course not only shared profound insights on children&rsquo;s education and self-worth realization but also delved into the practical application of financial tools like &ldquo;reverse mortgages&rdquo; and &ldquo;pledged loans.&rdquo; It also provided detailed explanations on the risk control and long-term operational principles of asset allocation (especially the 433 strategy involving leveraged funds). Through active questions and sharing from students, many practical confusions—such as allocation in different accounts, tax issues, and retirement cash flow planning—were clearly answered. Ultimately, the course returned to a fundamental point: build a strong inner self and adhere to the right principles, and wealth will naturally follow.</p>

      <description>In this episode, James first announced the upcoming two-week Clubhouse hiatus and then emphasized that market volatility is normal and there&amp;#39;s no need to over-analyze the reasons behind it. The core arguments revolved around the importance of long-term investing and index funds (especially the Nasdaq 100), and discussed the selection of specific ETFs (such as 00864B/00865B, BRK, HXQ). He also shared his fantasies about the future development of AI, exploring its potential impact on social structures, work, and the meaning of life. The Q&amp;amp;A session covered a range of practical issues, including market predictions, asset allocation ratios (70/30 rule, Beta value), ETF selection in different countries, digital currency risks, differences in investment philosophies between spouses, and retirement cash reserves.</description>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market Volatility is Normal</strong>: The market is always fluctuating; this is the unchanging rule. No need to analyze specific reasons (international situation, trade war, financial report forecasts, etc.). Many analysts themselves do not truly understand. The market is like the sea, unaffected by streams and storms.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Investing</strong>: True investment is buying with the intention of never selling. Intending to sell at a high point is speculation. Investment must be long-term.</li>
<li><strong>Index Investing</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Recommendation</strong>: Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQQ and its global equivalents). Reason: Compared to the S&amp;P 500 (500 companies, possibly 450 &ldquo;bad companies&rdquo;), the Nasdaq 100 focuses more on high-quality technology companies, aligning with the &ldquo;the bigger, the stronger&rdquo; trend.</li>
<li><strong>Retirees/Those with Less Capital</strong>: Consider Taiwan 0056 or US SPHD (dividend yield ~3.5%, providing stable cash flow).</li>
<li><strong>Nasdaq 100 ETF List</strong>: Provides a list of relevant ETFs including various countries (Canada HXQ.t, Singapore, Malaysia, Norway, UK, Australia, etc.). HXQ.t is recommended because it does not pay dividends (tax-free).</li>
<li><strong>Historical Experience</strong>: Watching videos since 2018 can provide insights into investor sentiment and responses during market fluctuations, giving a sense of the long-term perspective.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stay Optimistic</strong>: Investors need to be extremely optimistic, always facing the sunlight, believing that the market will be good in the long run, even if there is a world war, the market still exists and continues to rise (only rises, never falls).</li>
<li><strong>Investment Target Selection</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>00864B vs 00865B (Taiwan Bond ETF)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>00864B: Pays dividends, generating National Health Insurance Supplementary Premium (2.11%), requires manual reinvestment (with handling fees, easy to forget resulting in no compounding), dividends are considered overseas income (requires declaration if it exceeds the limit, but usually not a problem with annual income below NT$1 million; according to student feedback, it is exempt from the second-generation health insurance supplementary premium).</li>
<li>00865B: Does not pay dividends, avoiding the above problems, simpler and more effective in the long run. Low trading volume is not a problem (market makers provide liquidity), initial performance differences will shrink as scale increases. <strong>Strongly recommend switching to 00865B; convenience is a value.</strong> Conversion will incur a one-time transaction cost, but worth it in the long run.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/B)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Not recommended for investment</strong>. Reason: Actively managed fund, more volatile than the index; times are changing, performance has lagged behind the S&amp;P 500; uncertainty after Buffett (&ldquo;the devil will come out&rdquo;); learning Buffett should be about learning his long-term investment spirit, investment discourse (such as the definition of investment), rather than stock picking. Investing in the S&amp;P 500 may be better than investing in BRK.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation (Beta)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic Principle</strong>: It is recommended that most people allocate an investment portfolio with a Beta value of less than 1, such as 70% index funds + 30% cash/money market funds (Beta is approximately 0.7).</li>
<li><strong>Risk Tolerance</strong>: The recent 20% drop has made many people uncomfortable (even those with a Beta of 1.2 configured at 4:4:2), indicating that actual risk tolerance may be lower than expected. Do not sacrifice the comfort of holding enough cash (&ldquo;don&rsquo;t gamble with the money you need for the money you don&rsquo;t need&rdquo;) for an extra 1-2% of return.</li>
<li><strong>Adjustment</strong>: If the initial Beta is high (such as 1.2), it is recommended to review it at the end of each year. If the market rises, you can sell part of the leveraged/index position and supplement the cash to more than 30%, gradually reducing the Beta to below 1.0. Consider smart rebalancing after the Beta is below 1.0.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>AI Optimized Future</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Productivity greatly improved, most output is completed by AI (robots), and the cost of goods approaches zero.</li>
<li>Total social wealth accelerates, basic living needs (food, clothing, housing, transportation) may be free, uniformly supplied by the state/society (AI robots complete production, construction, and maintenance).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Social Structure Changes</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Classes Still Exist</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Capitalists</strong>: Earn profits by investing in and holding the means of production (AI systems) without labor; the wealthiest. Everyone can become a capitalist (just need to know how to invest).</li>
<li><strong>High-Tech Workers</strong>: Personnel who maintain and manage AI systems, with excellent income, can enjoy entertainment beyond basic needs (such as space travel), but may fall into the &ldquo;cared-for&rdquo; class if they stop working and do not become capitalists.</li>
<li><strong>Cared-For Class (approximately 80%)</strong>: No need to work, basic life is guaranteed (food, clothing, housing, transportation, medical care), but cannot enjoy additional entertainment or resources. The standard of living may be similar to the current upper-middle class, but without work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Philosophical Challenges</strong>:
<ul>
<li>When most people do not need to contribute for livelihood (&ldquo;nothing to serve&rdquo;), what is the meaning and purpose of life? (Analogous to being idle after retirement). May lead to widespread depression or social problems.</li>
<li>Human development may enter a stage of eternal life, facing greater philosophical and existential questions.</li>
<li>The focus should shift from &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; to &ldquo;the meaning of life.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Implications for Investors</strong>:
<ul>
<li>As capitalists, there is no need to worry about job loss due to AI development; on the contrary, they will become wealthier.</li>
<li>Start investing now to become part of the capitalist class.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: SPY and QQQ have risen for three days, will they continue to rise or fall next week?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Short-term market cannot be predicted, like flipping a coin. We invest for the long term (20+ years), focusing on long-term trends. Buy when you have money, never sell. Don&rsquo;t try to predict next week&rsquo;s market; ask the temple or the &ldquo;stock god&rdquo; in Clubhouse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing: Just started learning from the teacher&rsquo;s course two months ago, introduced by a friend in the United States. Currently in the learning stage, and has invested in some QQQ (cost between 515-530). After returning to Taiwan, considering investing in 00662. In the process of canceling previous insurance and converting individual stocks to 00662.</li>
<li>Question: Should I invest in US stocks (Firstrade account, worried about political risks in Taiwan for the child) or Taiwan stocks 00662? How to allocate at the beginning?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Recommend investing in 00662 in Taiwan, no need to use a US broker (Firstrade). It&rsquo;s better for the child to rely on themselves rather than worry about politics. When starting to learn, it is recommended to divide the total funds into three parts: 1/3 buy 00662 immediately, 1/3 buy in batches over the next 3-6 months, and 1/3 hold in cash. The ultimate goal is 70% 00662 + 30% cash. Then slowly learn whether and how to allocate leveraged funds (adjust the Beta value to 0.8-0.9).</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>Question 1: Who are QQQ and SPHD suitable for in terms of capital size?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: (Points out that students should watch the videos for repeated questions) This is a consideration for retirees. Need to calculate annual expenses after retirement. If 50 times the expenses equals your total assets, you can invest in QQQ (equivalent to a 2% annual withdrawal rate). If 2% is not enough, you need 3%, you may consider the S&amp;P 500. Only consider SPHD if you need even higher (~3.5-4%). Non-retirees should prioritize the high-growth QQQ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Explain Beta value. Beta=1 is synchronized with the market? Beta=1.2 is 1.2 times the volatility? Is the Beta of an 80% QQQ + 20% SGOV portfolio 0.8?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Basic understanding is correct. Beta measures the volatility of an asset relative to the market. The Beta of an 80/20 portfolio is approximately 0.8. (Reminds again that the videos explain it)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 3: Will the principal of SGOV (Short-Term US Treasury ETF) fall and lose money?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: The principal risk is extremely low, almost no losses (except for minor fluctuations before and after dividend payments). SGOV invests in short-term Treasury bills (T-Bills) issued by the US Treasury Department with a maturity of 0-3 months (or within one year), backed by the credit of the United States.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Joined for more than a month and reviewed the market decline in 2022 and the teacher&rsquo;s videos (especially #398 graduation episode, learned investment psychology).</li>
<li>Question 1: In January 2023 (#401), the teacher used technical indicators (50/100-day moving average crossover) to judge the market bottom and predict that 2023 would be a bull market, which was also verified afterwards. However, in later videos (#491), he emphasized not to predict market cycles and not to look at macroeconomic indicators (prosperity signals, macroeconomics, inventory cycles, etc.). Why this change? Are these indicators really useless in the long run? What was the basis for judging the bottom (just because of being optimistic about the stock market)? Should we just follow discipline and rebalance once a year?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: QQQ includes many industries (semiconductors, software, AI, biotechnology, retail such as Costco, Pepsico, Amazon, Google, Apple, etc.), and indicators for a single industry or country (such as Taiwan semiconductor economy, Taiwan prosperity signals, US prosperity signals) cannot reflect the overall index. Looking at all indicators is the same as looking at the index itself, so it is better to just focus on QQQ. The judgment in early 2023 was based on 40 years of experience (calculated that the 6-month moving average would cross upward), which is difficult to convey (&ldquo;unspeakable&rdquo;), and teaching technical analysis may cause students to misuse it and be harmed (&ldquo;go crazy&rdquo;), so it is not taught. Adhering to long-term investment discipline and holding enough cash buffer (such as 30%) is a more reliable method. Even if judging the bottom at that time, all cash would not be invested (such as still maintaining Beta 0.7), still maintaining a margin of safety. No need to take too much risk for small potential gains (referring to Buffett&rsquo;s philosophy).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: About the currency hedging of 00670L (Taiwan Leveraged QQQ ETF). Is the impact of exchange rate fluctuations significant in the long run? If the US dollar falls sharply (such as 1:13 against the Taiwan dollar), how will 00670L perform? (The teacher mentioned before that 00670L performs poorly when the US dollar rises)
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: 00670L is usually paired with 00865B (cash/short-term bonds). Exchange rate fluctuations have a hedging effect on both (when the US dollar rises, the hedging cost of 00670L increases, but the value of US dollar assets increases; the opposite is true when the US dollar falls). In the long run, exchange rate fluctuations are normal (such as the Taiwan dollar fluctuating between 28-32), but there is no fixed trend, and the expected value is zero. Currency hedging itself has a cost (wasting funds), which may not be necessary in the long run (it is recommended that fund companies consider canceling it), but the ETF is designed that way, and it does not hurt. The key is whether 00670L can achieve approximately twice the return of 00662 in the long run.</li>

<li>Sharing: Trump mentioned that 5.6 trillion in foreign investment may be invested in the United States in the future (may be exaggerated, even if halved, 2.8 trillion is also considerable), but the direction is beneficial to AI and QQQ. Observed that QQQ rebounded more strongly than SPY, DIA, and BRK recently, confirming the teacher&rsquo;s point of view (such as Katy Wood investing in AI-related companies when she saw mobile internet access). Compare the leadership styles of Chinese and American leaders (leader vs. manager) and the direction of attracting foreign investment (Saudi Arabia/Dubai vs. Myanmar/Vietnam/Malaysia).</li>
<li>Question: Please explain the difference between CIPS (Chinese RMB Cross-Border Payment System) and SWIFT. Why is CIPS faster (completed in 6 seconds)? Why does SWIFT take days? Can SWIFT be improved? Will this affect the status of the US dollar (AI replied that the two will coexist)?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: SWIFT is based on the traditional telegram transmission model (like a relay station), and information needs to be transferred through multiple layers (local bank -&gt; regional major bank -&gt; central bank -&gt; SWIFT center (Switzerland) -&gt; the other party&rsquo;s central bank -&gt; the other party&rsquo;s head office -&gt; the other party&rsquo;s branch), involving compliance checks (anti-money laundering), time difference, manual processing, etc., so it takes a long time (2+ days). CIPS is a modern real-time gross settlement system, similar to domestic payment systems in various countries, point-to-point or directly cleared through the central bank, and the speed is fast. CIPS uses RMB and is an alternative developed to deal with SWIFT being weaponized (such as sanctions against Russia), making people distrust the US dollar system. US sanctions opened a Pandora&rsquo;s box. Currently, CIPS is small (such as shipbuilding transactions between Malaysia and China), but it represents the trend of &ldquo;currency wars&rdquo; (such as Saudi Arabia and China being linked). Trump&rsquo;s visit to Saudi Arabia may be related to maintaining the status of the US dollar. Just watch the show.</li>

<li>Question: Regarding the customized version of ChatGPT (CCTeams Investment Advisor) shared by the teacher, its knowledge cutoff date seems to be June of last year. Is the teacher using an updated version? Will the link change after the update? (Previously confused HXQ/HSQ).
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Indeed, this AI is constantly being updated and trained. The link may change with updates. The latest link (showing content updated on April 26, such as 70/30 allocation recommendations) has been shared in the chat area. New links will be provided regularly (such as weekly or monthly) in the future. The teacher himself uses a more advanced personal &ldquo;Super AI&rdquo; account (possibly GPT-4o or higher, with memory function) to process and extract information, and then &ldquo;feeds&rdquo; the essence to this publicly shared GPTs version (similar to DIPS extraction). Feedback on AI answers is welcome for improvement.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Because of recent trade tensions, I re-listened to the 2022 recordings. Two points are profound: 1. The biggest risk is missing the market (leaving the market). 2. Focus on long-term returns, not short-term fluctuations/shocks. The market is full of contradictory information (repeated presidential statements, pessimistic commentators) and bad news, but it often rebounds unintentionally. Friends who wait for a clear trend (such as buying after the big trend comes back) miss the rise. No one can accurately time the market. It is extremely difficult to obtain stable and high returns in the long term (such as an annualized return of 10% or more), like the sustained performance of top athletes (such as playing ball for 20 years); it is easy to have a good shot occasionally, but difficult to be stable in the long term. It is essential to stay in the market for a long time and focus on long-term growth.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Strongly agree. Investing is like a long-distance race, continuing to stay in the front (such as 3rd or 4th place) will eventually win, because the leaders often make mistakes. This is how index funds are, not the best in a single year, but leading in the long term. Need an investment horizon of 15+ years. The key to persistence is having sufficient cash reserves (especially for retirees, it is recommended to have living expenses for 15+ years) or a continuous work income.</li>

<li>Sharing 1: Started following the teacher last year, investing on my own and encouraging elders (sold insurance and invested). Recently, I have experienced a market decline and am at peace, but the elders are experiencing large fluctuations for the first time (they adopted a Beta 1.2 allocation). Through repeatedly watching videos and communicating, the elders&rsquo; confidence is still stable.</li>
<li>Sharing 2: Selling a house has been tortuous: difficulty communicating with my husband (disagreed at first, had disputes), cold market (the central bank fought housing speculation in September, difficult to get loans), price reduction (applied the teacher&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;there is no house that cannot be sold, only a price that cannot be sold&rdquo;) to complete the sale (in February this year). The process was painful (communication, management, market changes, funds stuck, high taxes), and I learned a lesson that I don&rsquo;t want to experience again.</li>
<li>Sharing 3: Currently, half of the investment portfolio is QQQ-like, half is TSMC, and there is also a mortgage line of credit (financial mortgage). My husband wants to use this line of credit to increase positions when the market falls (TSMC?), but hesitates and is afraid in the middle of the actual fall (soft-handed, unable to do it). This decline allowed him to experience his true risk tolerance. My husband did not accept the full QQQ allocation before, but now he has some experience. It verifies the stability of the teacher&rsquo;s asset allocation method.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Appreciate Monmon&rsquo;s peaceful state of mind (a good quality for investors, &ldquo;destiny&rdquo; + &ldquo;luck&rdquo; to meet the teacher). Communicating with family requires patience (it is a 15-30 year undertaking, no rush). The funds from the financial mortgage should be invested as soon as possible (such as 00662), buy blindly, and don&rsquo;t time the market. When investing, consider the overall asset allocation, include the loan amount in the total asset calculation, and ensure that the total Beta value is within the desired range (such as about 0.7, that is, maintaining an overall ratio of about 70/30), rather than investing all the borrowed money in high-risk assets. It is recommended to keep at least 30% cash (can be 4:1:5 or 5:1:4, Beta 0.6 or 0.7). This decline is a touchstone for risk tolerance, proving the necessity of conservative allocation. Even if young and have a job, 30% cash is also recommended.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: The situation is similar to Monmon&rsquo;s. Both myself and the elders invested in 00662/00670L, using Beta 1.2 (4:4:2, that is, 40% 00662, 40% 00670L, 20% cash/00865B) allocation. I can bear the recent fluctuations (the government is quite amazing), but I am not sure whether the elders (who have not watched YouTube, have no financial common sense, but believe and invest) can bear greater future declines (such as 40-80%). Continuously accompany the elders and give them confidence. The elders have a good mentality so far.</li>
<li>Question: If I want to reduce the Beta for the elders, when and how should I operate?
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: It is generally recommended now that the Beta should not exceed 1.0 (such as 70/30). For an existing allocation of 1.2, it is recommended to evaluate it at the end of each year: if the market rises (such as 00662 returning to the level at the beginning of the year or higher), you can sell part of the leveraged position (00670L) and transfer the funds to cash (00865B), so that the cash ratio is adjusted to 30% or higher. If the market is down at the end of the year, then do not move. The goal is to gradually reduce the Beta to below 1.0. Before that, there is no need to consider complicated rebalancing strategies. Don&rsquo;t operate too frequently (once a year) to avoid increasing the elders&rsquo; anxiety (they may secretly look at the APP).</li>

<li>Question 1: Investing in QQQ in Canada, the teacher recommends QQC, etc., and mentions avoiding Hedged funds? It seems that most Canadian versions are Hedged? Which one should I choose? (Previously confused HXQ/HSQ).
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Recommend HXQ.t because it does not pay dividends, making tax treatment simpler. If you already hold QQC.to or ZQQ, there is no need to sell it, and new investments can be bought in HXQ.t. It is also acceptable if only Hedged versions are available locally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Please explain the asset allocation ratio (such as 70/30, 4:4:2). Time is limited (working, back problems requiring exercise, blood sugar problems), it is difficult to find specific content in videos, and listening to Clubhouse is also time-consuming.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: (Emphasizing the importance of learning, earning money from work only accounts for a small part of a lifetime of wealth, so you should spend time learning about investment) For ordinary investors working in Canada, the simplest allocation is: 70% HXQ.t + 30% cash/money market fund (Money Market). Check and adjust annually (sell the ones that have risen more to supplement cash, or use cash to buy the ones that have fallen more) to maintain this ratio.</li>
<li>(Nibalao Supplement): Canadian local stock dividends have tax advantages, while US-sourced dividends (such as QQC) are taxed (I don&rsquo;t know how much, but higher than Canadian stock taxes). I agree with the teacher&rsquo;s point of view: focus on investment returns is higher than focusing on work.</li>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Reiterating the advantage of HXQ.t not paying dividends. Canadian funds seem to be performing well, possibly because better compounding due to not paying dividends.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Detailed comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin/cryptocurrencies and QQQ, based on his personal experience in the blockchain industry (entered the industry in 2017, experienced the blockchain/cryptocurrency community, ICO explosion, 2018 bear market):
<ul>
<li>Storage Security: BTC requires self-management of private keys/hardware wallets (cold wallets), which are easy to lose or damage, high risk; QQQ is托管ed by brokers, which is safe.</li>
<li>Transaction Security: BTC is vulnerable to hacker attacks, phishing, and platform crashes; QQQ is protected by regulations.</li>
<li>Staking/Liquidity: BTC lacks standardized and safe staking channels (DeFi is high risk); QQQ can be easily staked and borrowed (pledged) through brokers without selling.</li>
<li>Taxes: Selling BTC requires capital gains tax; holding QQQ for a long time and using pledges can avoid/defer taxes.</li>
<li>Legality: BTC has legal risks in China (trading and mining are illegal), and cashing out may be frozen; QQQ (and QDII 513100/513300) are legal and compliant.</li>
<li>Volatility/Risk: BTC is extremely volatile (short-term drops of 50-80% are common, such as an 85% drop in 2018), and ordinary people cannot withstand the mental stress; QQQ has a much lower frequency of large fluctuations.</li>
<li>Liquidity: The actual circulating volume of BTC is limited (locked by large holders, lost coins), which is not as high as the global liquidity of QQQ.</li>
<li>Practicality: Not detailed.</li>
<li>Future Returns: BTC has a high market value (nearly 2 trillion US dollars, comparable to top technology companies), and the possibility of super high multiple growth in the future is reduced (even if it rises to 200,000 US dollars/coin, it is only 2-3 times), and the rate of return may tend to be stable, lower than QQQ.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Cryptocurrencies are &ldquo;demons and ghosts,&rdquo; not suitable for ordinary investors, highly tempting but extremely risky.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>James&rsquo; Comment: Completely agree, cryptocurrencies should not be touched. Shared cases of others losing huge amounts of Bitcoin (equivalent to 15 million US dollars) due to unfamiliarity with cross-chain transfer rules (such as transferring between different chains or exchanges that do not support the target chain), emphasizing its complexity and risk (may be a technical problem or fraud).</li>

The core information is still focused on: adhering to long-term holding of high-quality index funds (especially the Nasdaq 100), understanding and accepting market fluctuations, maintaining rationality and patience, using time compounding, and conducting sound asset allocation according to personal risk tolerance (emphasizing the importance of at least 30% cash), and being vigilant about market noise and high-risk speculative products (such as cryptocurrencies). The Q&amp;A session answered in detail the specific questions encountered by students in different countries, different stages, and different product selections, and emphasized the importance of continuous learning of investment knowledge. Finally, it was reminded again that the Clubhouse will be suspended for the next two weeks.</p>
