      <description>In this episode, Teacher James delves into the true definition of financial freedom: the complete disregard for the existence of money and the market. The content covers the mindset for recent market volatility, reminders for smart rebalancing at year-end, and warnings against AI fraud. On the technical side, he provides a detailed analysis of the target audience and tax implications for high-dividend ETFs (JEPQ, QQQI), as well as how to handle the premium of the China 513100 fund. Additionally, through student Q&amp;amp;A, the session discusses the pros and cons of real estate versus stock assets, the disruptive impact of AI technology on the future, and wisdom regarding interpersonal relationships and retirement life.</description>

<p>The theme of this episode focuses on <strong>&ldquo;True Freedom&rdquo;</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;An Investment Mindset that Ignores the Market.&rdquo;</strong> Teacher James emphasizes that market volatility (such as a 5% rise or fall) and international situations should be irrelevant to investors. True freedom is when daily life is no longer constrained by monetary considerations. Furthermore, as the end of the year approaches, students are reminded to perform &ldquo;Smart Rebalancing.&rdquo; The session also highlights the characteristics and use cases of high-dividend ETFs (such as QQQI, JEPQ) and deeply explores how AI technology is changing content creation and future lifestyles.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ignoring Market Volatility</strong>: The market fluctuated by 10% over the past two weeks, but this should have zero impact on long-term index investors. If you can manage to be completely unaware of last week&rsquo;s market fluctuations, or even log into your account only once a year, you are a successful investor.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Freedom</strong>: The definition of freedom is &ldquo;money is not within your considerations.&rdquo; Whether dining out, traveling, or buying a house, being able to act as if you are buying a pair of slippers without considering the price—that is attaining the realm of freedom.</li>
<li><strong>Year-End Operations</strong>: It is currently November/December, which is a good time for <strong>Smart Rebalancing</strong>. If you don&rsquo;t want to do it now, doing it early next year is also fine.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>China 513100 Premium Issue</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Do not obsess over the premium. Due to foreign exchange controls, financial institutions cannot immediately arbitrage to close the gap, so the premium may exist for a long time (even 100 years).</li>
<li><strong>Strategy</strong>: Buy immediately at market price. Getting &ldquo;on the bus&rdquo; is what matters most; do not miss the market rally while waiting for the premium to converge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>High-Dividend ETF Analysis (JEPQ, QQQI)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: Those who have retired and need stable cash flow. <strong>Young people should not invest in this</strong>; they should focus on growth.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>JEPQ</strong>: Dividend yield approx. 10%, Beta approx. 0.7-0.8 (lower volatility).</li>
<li><strong>QQQI</strong>: Dividend yield approx. 12-13%, Beta approx. 0.9-1.1 (volatility close to QQQ).</li>
<li><strong>Major Holdings</strong>: These funds typically hold about 80% in QQQ and use the other 20% for options strategies (Covered Call, etc.) to generate cash flow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tax Issues</strong>:
<ul>
<li>US Tax Residents: Primarily treated as Long-term capital gains (preferential tax rate), not ordinary Income.</li>
<li>Taiwan/Overseas Investors: If the brokerage (e.g., SinoPac re-consignment, with IBKR as the upstream) has QI status, there may be an automatic Refund, allowing for full dividend receipt. Generally, non-US residents face 30% withholding, but products like QQQI may have higher refund ratios due to their structural characteristics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Risk Warning</strong>: These are not Cash (Money Market); they will still fall with the market (potentially dropping 20-30%) and risk must be considered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Leveraged Fund Risks</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Although leveraged funds (like TQQQ) won&rsquo;t go to zero, they can face a 99% decline.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Rebalancing</strong> must be executed: convert profits to cash during rises so you have funds to replenish positions during major market crashes (e.g., an 85% drop).</li>
<li>Leveraged positions must not exceed the prototype fund or cash positions.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Houses are Cages</strong>: Young people should not buy houses too early; carrying a mortgage is like locking yourself in a cage. Buying a house should only be considered when it feels as easy as buying slippers.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Recently listened to a speech by Charlie Munger and learned about holding cash, understanding risk, antifragility, and not being jealous.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Munger always emphasized &ldquo;no leverage&rdquo; and &ldquo;no borrowing,&rdquo; but Buffett actually uses insurance float as leverage. Why did Munger advise this? Does it conflict with our concept of &ldquo;leveraged investing&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Munger opposed <strong>borrowing for consumption</strong> (e.g., Americans borrowing to buy mansions, luxury cars, paying for travel in installments), which leads to being &ldquo;exquisitely poor.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Munger opposed <strong>all-in, unhedged leveraged investment</strong> (like going all-in on Bitcoin or a single stock).</li>
<li>Our borrowing is based on <strong>asset allocation and risk control</strong>, which is completely different from the gambling-style borrowing Munger opposed.</li>
<li>Regarding jealousy: Never compare yourself with others; compare with yourself. Win at the finish line, not at the starting line. Be overflowing with confidence and ignore outside noise.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: My firm, which I ran for 15 years, is closing due to hiring difficulties. Although I have enough money, I feel I wasted my youth and feel sad. How do I adjust?</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: Single, 50 years old, no children, assets approx. 35 million TWD, annual expenses 1.8 million. Previously advised a 3-1-6 allocation; can I now use 18 million to buy high-dividend ETFs (like 0056 or QQQI) and do a 70/30 allocation with the rest?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Regarding Asset Allocation</strong>: Since you have 35 million, taking 20 million to buy QQQI or 0056 generates over 2 million in cash flow annually, fully covering the 1.8 million expenses with surplus. Keep 5 million in cash and buy 00662 with the rest for long-term growth. You have plenty of money; enjoy it to the fullest.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding Mindset</strong>: Closing the firm is a good thing; it ends the torture. Life doesn&rsquo;t require &ldquo;doing things&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s okay to contain &ldquo;idleness.&rdquo; Establish <strong>rituals</strong> in life (gardening, keeping fish, pour-over coffee, reading), enjoy freedom, and don&rsquo;t need work to prove your value.</li>
<li><strong>Special Advice</strong>: Single people need to build a close circle of friends who can &ldquo;go to the emergency room with you at 2 AM.&rdquo; This is very important.</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: I have a retired client couple with few assets, living on Social Security. They own a large house worth about 6 million USD. The wife has an emotional attachment to &ldquo;home&rdquo; and refuses to sell, wanting to turn it into an Airbnb while they move back to Taiwan. Is this wise?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Very unwise. Keeping a big house (&ldquo;old hen&rdquo;) that doesn&rsquo;t lay eggs is not cost-effective. The maintenance costs (property tax, repairs) for a 6 million dollar house are extremely high.</li>
<li><strong>Advice</strong>: Sell the house, cash out 3-4 million USD, invest in QQQI, and generate 300,000-400,000 USD in annual cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: With this huge cash flow, they can rent the highest-end apartments (with pools, gyms, social events) anywhere in the world (including the US) and enjoy true freedom, instead of being an Airbnb landlord dealing with messes. Mindsets must change; don&rsquo;t be trapped by &ldquo;poor man&rsquo;s thinking.&rdquo;</li>

<li><strong>Question</strong>: Considering moving back to the Bay Area. No longer obsessed with buying a house or top school districts; thinking renting and mid-to-upper school districts are fine?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Strongly support this. Even as a VP, you can &ldquo;work with one hand&rdquo;; being less busy actually improves efficiency.</li>
<li>Renting in the Bay Area ($4500-5000) gets you into luxury apartments with excellent facilities, offering a higher quality of life.</li>
<li><strong>Regarding School Districts</strong>: You don&rsquo;t need to squeeze children into top school districts that are entirely Asian. Mid-to-upper Mixed school districts are actually better for children to integrate into American society and diverse cultures.</li>

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: TQQQ recently did a stock split. Is this good or bad?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Neither good nor bad; the essence hasn&rsquo;t changed at all. It&rsquo;s like exchanging a 100-dollar bill for two 50-dollar bills. The value remains the same; it&rsquo;s just a numbers game in accounting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong>: regarding retirement, some say the brain degenerates if you retire, others say retiring early is good. What&rsquo;s your view?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: The key is <strong>Freedom</strong>. If you don&rsquo;t dare to live somewhere because taxes are high (like California), that is not freedom. The goal should be to be unconstrained by money and location.</li>

<li><strong>Question 3</strong>: My son bought a life insurance policy (Whole Life), paying $1000/month. He has paid 130k. Initially told he only needed to pay for 10 years, now the agent says he has to pay until age 100?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is <strong>garbage</strong>. I suggest stopping it (Cancel) immediately. Instead of paying $1000 to the insurance company every month, put it into QQQ. Savings/Whole Life insurance for young people usually has low returns, and eventually, even the principal might be eaten up by premiums.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: Strongly agree. Children are independent individuals; studying isn&rsquo;t the only path.

<li><strong>Question 1</strong>: Michael Burry and others believe AI hardware (GPUs, etc.) depreciates too slowly, actual obsolescence is fast, and there might be financial fraud or a bubble?
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply</strong>: This is nonsense. It is normal for tech hardware (like data centers, GPUs) to depreciate over 5-7 years. The release of a new generation doesn&rsquo;t mean old ones are scrapped immediately; old equipment continues to generate value (Perform).

<ul>
<li>AI is <strong>Everywhere</strong>. In the future, there will be no concept of Apps, only Input (Voice/Vision) and Output (Screen/Execution).</li>
<li>AI will become your <strong>Agent</strong>, handling all miscellaneous tasks (ordering coffee, booking doctors, making spreadsheets, buying tickets).</li>

      <description>In this session, Teacher James details the &amp;#39;Flexible Smart Rebalancing&amp;#39; strategy developed by student Peng, an enhanced version of the traditional smart rebalancing aimed at improving asset allocation security. The core of the strategy is to set a cash-year threshold, flexibly adjusting the funding source for rebalancing. Additionally, James discusses withdrawal rates corresponding to different Beta values and introduces high-dividend ETFs like JEPQ as a solution for retirees with insufficient cash flow.</description>

<p>This session delves into the &ldquo;Flexible Smart Rebalancing&rdquo; optimization strategy. Its core idea is to add a &ldquo;cash years&rdquo; criterion to the traditional smart rebalancing framework. When cash reserves fall below a preset number of years (e.g., 15 years), market downturns will no longer deplete cash. Instead, the underlying fund (e.g., QQQ) will be used to buy more of the leveraged fund to protect cash flow and enhance the portfolio&rsquo;s security. Concurrently, for retirees with higher cash flow needs, an alternative solution of allocating to high-dividend ETFs (such as JEPQ) is proposed.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strategy Background</strong>: This strategy was optimized and back-tested by student Peng, based on Teacher James&rsquo;s smart rebalancing concept, with the goal of increasing the maintenance rate (security).</li>
<li><strong>Core Mechanism</strong>: It introduces a customizable &ldquo;cash years&rdquo; variable (e.g., 15 years) as a threshold for switching strategies.
<ol>
<li><strong>When Cash Level is Below 15 Years</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>During a Market Upturn</strong>: Profits from the leveraged fund are moved into cash, with the goal of replenishing cash reserves to over 15 years as quickly as possible. Consider transferring 30%, 40%, or 50% of the profitable portion to accelerate cash accumulation.</li>
<li><strong>During a Market Downturn</strong>: <strong>Do not use cash</strong>. Instead, sell the underlying fund (e.g., QQQ) to buy the leveraged fund (e.g., TQQQ) to maintain the Beta value while protecting precious cash reserves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>When Cash Level is Above 15 Years</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The strategy reverts to traditional smart rebalancing. During a market downturn, cash can be used to buy more of the leveraged fund.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Strategy Version Evolution (1.0 vs. 2.0)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Version 1.0</strong>: The core is to reduce downside risk. During upturns, profits from the leveraged fund are converted to cash.</li>
<li><strong>Version 2.0</strong>: With sufficient cash (above the threshold), it increases upside potential. During upturns, profits from the leveraged fund can be moved into the underlying fund (QQQ) instead of cash. This slows down the decrease in Beta, allowing for the capture of more upside opportunities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Back-testing Conclusion</strong>: Data shows that under different Beta settings, the &ldquo;Flexible Rebalancing&rdquo; strategy, especially when using the appropriate version for different Beta values, generally provides a higher minimum maintenance rate than traditional smart rebalancing, meaning higher security.</li>
</ul>

    </span>        
    
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationship Between Beta and Withdrawal Rate</strong>: The recommended annual withdrawal rate varies with the portfolio&rsquo;s volatility (Beta):
<ul>
<li>Beta 1.0: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.0%</li>
<li>Beta 0.9: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.2%</li>
<li>Beta 0.8: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.4%</li>
<li>Beta 0.7: Recommended withdrawal rate 2.8%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Solution for High Withdrawal Rates</strong>: When the required withdrawal rate <strong>exceeds 3%</strong>, traditional asset allocation becomes riskier. It is recommended to introduce high-dividend assets to supplement cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Introduction to High-Dividend ETFs (JEPQ &amp; JEPI)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>JEPQ</strong>: Annualized dividend yield of about 10%. Approximately 80% of its assets are in QQQ, with the other 20% generating cash flow by selling covered calls. Its Beta is about 0.78, making it less volatile than QQQ and suitable for retirees needing high cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>JEPI</strong>: Annualized dividend yield of about 8.37%. It operates based on SPY and has a lower Beta of about 0.57.</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: These ETFs are primarily suitable for investors who are <strong>already retired, have insufficient principal, and are highly dependent on stable cash flow</strong>. They are not recommended for young investors still in the asset accumulation phase, as their long-term capital appreciation potential is far lower than QQQ.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Principles</strong>: Even if you don&rsquo;t understand the complex strategy details, grasp these key principles:
<ol>
<li><strong>Cash is King</strong>: If using a stock pledge loan, maintain a cash position of at least 30%.</li>
<li><strong>15-Year Cash Goal</strong>: Strive to maintain cash reserves equivalent to at least 15 years of living expenses as an important safety buffer.</li>
<li><strong>Beta Control</strong>: Keep the overall portfolio Beta below 1.0 to navigate market fluctuations smoothly.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Assets and Inflation</strong>: Stocks are real assets, and their intrinsic value is not eroded by inflation. When currency depreciates, the price of assets (stock prices) will rise to reflect their value. Therefore, do not sell quality assets (like QQQ) due to fears of inflation or short-term market volatility. Selling at any time is a mistake.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sharing:
<ol>
<li><strong>Inspiration for Flexible Rebalancing 1.0</strong>: It originated from Teacher James&rsquo;s mention that when cash is less than 15 years, one should not use cash to buy leveraged funds during a down year. Based on this, he conducted quantitative back-testing and tested different cash-year thresholds (13, 14, 15, 16 years) and the effect of transferring different percentages (30%, 40%, 50%) of profits to cash during upturns.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration for Flexible Rebalancing 2.0</strong>: Inspired by a strategy shared by student Lin. He pondered whether, when the cash position is sufficient, profits from the leveraged fund could be moved to the underlying fund (instead of cash) to slow the decline in Beta, thereby capturing more future upside potential.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Version 1.0 aims to &ldquo;reduce downside risk,&rdquo; while Version 2.0 builds on this to &ldquo;increase upside potential.&rdquo; He emphasized that the current back-testing period is limited and this is still his personal exploration, not to be taken as a final conclusion. However, the general direction is that a higher cash position leads to a higher maintenance rate.</li>

<ul>
<li>Question: Why do you recommend withdrawing 2% annually instead of borrowing the full 20% of the pledge limit from the start?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: This is a critical risk control issue. If you borrow 20% at once and the market experiences a major crash like in 2000 (an 85% drop), your assets would fall from $1 million to $150,000, but your debt would still be $200,000. you would go bankrupt immediately. By withdrawing 2% annually, even if the market declines for three or four consecutive years, you would have only used 8% of your total assets, and your assets would still be far greater than your liabilities, allowing you to survive the crisis safely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing: He observed that QQQ&rsquo;s annual return (23.29%) has surpassed VT&rsquo;s (19.92%), refuting an influencer&rsquo;s previous claim that VT would crush QQQ.

<ul>
<li>Sharing: Two things are especially important in investing: first, clarifying your investment Purpose, and second, setting a matching Target. The most dangerous situation is a mismatch between purpose and target. For example, investing with a mindset of entertainment (gambling) but expecting a stable cash flow or high returns will inevitably lead to disaster. Many friends around her made this mistake by engaging in all sorts of frantic trading during a bull market.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: Very well said. It&rsquo;s like someone who does drugs and stays up all night but expects to be healthy—an impossible task. The actions of most people are contrary to their ultimate goals, but they don&rsquo;t realize it themselves. This is a lifelong tragedy.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Your situation is excellent. Since your basic living expenses are covered by this $100,000 stable cash flow, you don&rsquo;t need to reserve that many years of cash. Depending on your comfort level, you can keep, for instance, 5 years of cash or 10% of your total assets in cash as a backup.

The remedy now is: immediately stop contributing more money to the retirement account and focus all your efforts on building a personal brokerage account. At the same time, you should start converting funds from your Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA annually as soon as possible. Within the IRA, you can also allocate: put a small amount in a Roth IRA to buy TQQQ, so the high-growth portion is tax-free; keep the majority in the Traditional IRA holding QQQ or cash, which will reduce the tax burden during conversion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Are JEPQ and JEPI meant to be replacements for QQQ?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Not replacements. They are tools for a specific group of people (retired, insufficient principal, need high cash flow). Those still in the asset accumulation phase should not touch them. The funding allocation order for retirees should be: 1. Meet cash flow needs (JEPQ), 2. Set aside an emergency fund, 3. Only if there is money left over, consider investing in QQQ for growth.</li>

<li>Sharing: She bought QQQ in 2021 after listening to the teacher&rsquo;s class but sold in a panic during the 2022 market downturn. This year, she rebuilt her confidence, consolidated her assets, and followed the teacher&rsquo;s method. She is now up over 30% and feels more confident about her future retirement.</li>
<li>Question 1: In the event of future hyperinflation, which is a better store of value, real estate or stocks? Can the stock market withstand the test?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Stocks are assets. Inflation means money is worthless, but the value of the asset remains. At that time, the price of the asset (stock price) will rise to reflect its real value. Short-term market drops are due to human fear, not value destruction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question 2: Is the 10% dividend from JEPQ fixed? If the principal drops from $500,000 to $300,000, will the dividend also decrease proportionally?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: Its dividend amount is relatively stable; it does not fluctuate strictly as a percentage of the principal. It&rsquo;s more like an annuity, designed to provide a steady stream of cash flow. So even if the market value drops, the dividend amount you receive will not decrease proportionally.</li>

<li>Question: Her family members previously bought QQQ and leveraged funds, but sold everything out of fear after making only fifty or sixty thousand dollars. Now they only dare to buy money market funds (865B) and have missed out on significant subsequent gains. How can she persuade them?
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: You can&rsquo;t save them; this is their &ldquo;fate.&rdquo; Not everyone can become wealthy; 99.99% of people are destined to be poor. For those who won&rsquo;t listen, you should &ldquo;let go.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t worry about them, just manage your own investments well.</li>

<li>Question: I&rsquo;m curious why the teacher mentioned a new investment vehicle like JEPQ today.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Reply: It was because of a specific case: a 72-year-old student with only $600,000 in principal who needs $40,000 a year for living expenses. To help solve his problem, I researched high-dividend products and found JEPQ and JEPI to be relatively stable options. This is because they are not purely derivatives; they hold a large amount of real assets (80% index components), so they can be considered. This is to solve the cash flow problem for seniors, not a recommendation for the average investor.</li>

<li>Sharing: He shared the story of a 78-year-old relative in his family who is in financial difficulty due to kidney failure, requiring dialysis three times a week. He advised the relative to sell a piece of ancestral land that generated no cash flow and invest the funds into Taiwan&rsquo;s high-dividend ETF 0056. This would generate nearly 600,000 TWD in annual cash flow (50,000 TWD per month), completely solving her living expenses and allowing her to live with more dignity. He believes that the form of an asset can be changed; converting land into a stock asset that continuously generates cash flow can also be passed down to future generations.
<ul>
<li>Teacher James&rsquo;s Comment: There is much suffering in the world, but the number of people we can help is limited. You gave excellent advice, but if she is unwilling to sell the land, that is her choice. We can only help those who are willing to be helped. At the same time, he also reminded everyone to protect their kidney health, drink more water, and stay away from junk food and sugary drinks.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>You think what you&rsquo;re doing is moving you towards your goal, but in reality, you&rsquo;re just moving further away from it, and you still think you&rsquo;re heading towards your goal. This is the most frightening thing.
&ndash; Lin</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote profoundly points out the disconnect between the actions and goals of many investors. They engage in speculative, trend-chasing, and other entertainment-like operations, yet expect to achieve long-term, stable financial objectives. Ultimately, they often end up going in the opposite direction, wasting precious time and capital.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stocks are assets&hellip; How much they sell for is determined by you, the asset owner&hellip; As long as you sell (QQQ), you are wrong. Selling at any time is wrong because you are selling too low.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to concerns about inflation, Teacher James emphasized the nature of quality stocks as real assets. Their long-term value will continuously grow, and short-term price fluctuations should not affect the determination to hold. Selling quality assets is equivalent to giving away huge future potential at a low price.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can&rsquo;t save the poor&hellip; 99.99% of people are fated to be poor, it can&rsquo;t be helped. So you should just&hellip; let go.
&ndash; Teacher James</p></blockquote>
<p>While this statement may sound blunt, it reflects a reality in investment education: we can only influence those who are willing to accept and change. For family or friends who are stubborn and dominated by fear, it is better to let go and focus on one&rsquo;s own growth than to persuade them in vain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When people get old, if you don&rsquo;t have money, others might see you as a kind of &rsquo;lower-class elderly&rsquo;.
&ndash; Haoqing</p></blockquote>
<p>This point raised by Haoqing in his sharing very realistically highlights the importance of financial independence in old age. Having a stable cash flow is not just for survival, but for maintaining dignity, avoiding dependency on others, and being at their mercy in one&rsquo;s later years.</p>

<p>This session provided a significant optimization to the smart rebalancing strategy from a more refined and secure perspective, introducing the concept of &ldquo;Flexible Rebalancing.&rdquo; The core idea is to protect cash as a lifeline, preferring to exchange underlying assets for leveraged assets rather than easily tapping into cash reserves when they are insufficient. At the same time, the course demonstrated strong practicality by offering concrete and viable solutions, such as allocating to high-dividend products like JEPQ, for groups facing real-life difficulties (like insufficient retirement funds). Overall, this session not only deepened the theory of asset allocation but also closely integrated the practical financial needs of different life stages, once again emphasizing the core investment principles of long-term holding, risk control, and cash is king.</p>
